 <h1>A slew of reasons why Java packages should be built from source
 code</h1>

<ul>
<li>End-users may want to manually patch or tweak the sources between
    src_unpack and src_compile.</li>

<li>The USE flags will normally impact on which features are to be compiled
    in, and which dependencies we want to allow.</li>
  
<li>When security flaws are found, we want to issue a hotfix immediately.
    It is not always feasible to wait for the upstream project to make a
    new release. With binary-only packages, the only fix we can offer is
    disabling the software entirely and masking it.</li>

<li>It is common that we need to apply Gentoo-specific tweaks and
    intermediary patches when upstream takes a long time to issue a new
    release, which is almost always only possible when we compile from
    sources.</li>

<li>There is an obvious correspondence between the source code and the
    resulting binaries, so the user is guaranteed that there are no
    trojans hiding in the binaries (we don't guarantee the lack of trojans
    in the source code itself, but at least it's easier to find there).</li>
  
<li>We guarantee to our users that the source exists and compiles
    properly, the basis of regular open-source development.</li>

<li>For immature library packages, where documentation is often scanty,
    the user can easily run javadoc on the sources, as a stop-gap measure,
    without needing to dig out the source code from upstream.</li>
