<h2>Eclipse on Gentoo</h2>

<p>Both the Eclipse 2.1.x and 3.0.x series are available on Gentoo. The latter is however marked for testing,
and is only available if you explicitly unmask it by adding the following to your /etc/portage/package.unmask:
<pre>
>=dev-util/eclipse-sdk-2.9
</pre></p>

<h2>Extensions in Eclipse</h2>

<h3>Installing extensions</h2>

<p>You can freely install plugins and features using Eclipse's Update Manager in your home directory with
the Eclipse provded in Gentoo. In fact, you can install plugins wherever your user has write permissions.
</p>

<p>The features and plugins managed by Portage, however, will be installed in fixed locations.</p>

<p>All extensions that are compiled entirely from source code will be installed into the main eclipse 
library, in /usr/lib/eclipse-2 (or -3).</p>
 
<p>All extensions where the .jar files are installed as-is, will be installed into 
/opt/eclipse-extensions-2 (or -3).</p>

<p>This means that any from-source extension will be automatically available inside your Eclipse environment,
but you must explicitly link the directory /usr/eclipse-extensions-2 into your workspace using the Update 
Manager if you want to avail yourself of the binary extensions.</p>
 
<p>This linking only needs to be done once for every workspace. New binaries will automatically show up when
merged after the initial link has been set up.</p>

<h3>Writing ebuilds for extensions</h3>

<p>All Eclipse extensions should be handled by the <tt>eclipse-ext</tt> eclass.</p>

<p>Submitted ebuilds should strive to compile the extension from source code. Especially if is reliant on
architecture-specific binary code, or the actual UI (gtk vs motif) it is running on, it <b>must</b> compile
the extension entirely from sources.</p>

<p>For examples, look at dev-util/ecletex for a from-source extension and dev-util/eclipse-gef-bin for a
binary-only extension.</p>
