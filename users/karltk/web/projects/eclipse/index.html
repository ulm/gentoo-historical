<h2>Eclipse on Gentoo</h2>

<p>Both the Eclipse 2.1.x and 3.0.x series are available on Gentoo. The 3.0.x series has not been
officially released by the Eclipse project yet, and is to be considered a moving target.</p>

<p>Those of you who have been using our Eclipse packages for a while, will undoubtedly have noticed
some major and possibly disrupting changes as of late. We have been busy at integrating Eclipse better
into the Portage system, to allow users to install extensions either through Portage or from the
built-in Update Manager (more on this later).</p>

<p>In this process we have packaged numerous extensions (with plenty help from our users!), but be
aware that few extensions work on both the 2.1.x and 3.0.x series. In fact, most new extensions are
mainly targeted at the to-be-released 3.0.x series.</p>

<h3>Eclipse 2.1.x</h3>

<p>This is currently the stable series of Eclipse, and is at the time of writing available on x86,
ppc and sparc (on the two latter platforms, it is marked for testing, so you need to do
<tt class="command">ACCEPT_KEYWORD="~sparc" emerge eclipse-sdk</tt> in order to have it installed).</p>

<p>We have removed the <tt class="pkg">eclipse-platform-bin</tt>, <tt class="pkg">eclipse-jdt-bin</tt>,
<tt class="pkg">eclipse-ftp-webdav-bin</tt> ebuilds and replaced them by <tt class="pkg">eclipse-sdk</tt>.
This allows you, the user, to customise Eclipse for either GNOME, KDE or neither, and to select support
for either the gtk+ or Motif widget toolkits at installation time.</p>

<p>We have retained the <tt class="pkg">eclipse-cdt-bin</tt> for now, as constructing a from-source ebuild
for it has proved very time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Eclipse 3.0.x</h3>

<p>This series is marked for testing, and is so-called "hard-masked", meaning it is only available
if you explicitly unmask it by adding the following to your <tt>/etc/portage/package.unmask</tt>:
<pre>
>=dev-util/eclipse-sdk-2.9
</pre>
</p>

<p>We have packaged (thanks Kai!) <tt class="pkg">eclipse-emf-bin</tt>,
<tt class="pkg">eclipse-gef-bin</tt> and <tt class="pkg">eclipse-ve-bin</tt> as well as
<tt class="pkg">ecletex</tt> to go along with it. These deserve thorough testing.</tt></pp>

<h2>Extensions in Eclipse</h2>

<p>Eclipse is extended through <em>features</em> and <em>plugins</em>. Features are a collection of
one of more plugins. We use the term <em>extension</em> as an abstraction over both, when the
difference is irrelevant.</p>

<h3>Installing new extensions</h2>

<p>You can freely install plugins and features using Eclipse's Update Manager in your home directory with
the Eclipse provided in Gentoo. In fact, you can install plugins wherever your user has write
permissions, subject to some rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can freely upgrade the extensions managed by the Update Manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Extensions installed by Portage must be updated through Portage.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Portage will always install its extensions into either <tt>/usr/lib/eclipse-&lt;slot&gt;</tt> or
<tt>/opt/eclipse-extensions-&lt;slot&gt;</tt>, where <tt>slot</tt> is 2 for Eclipse 2.1.x and 3 for
3.0.x (more on this later).</p>

<h3>Using extensions installed by Portage</h3>

<p>Currently, all extensions compiled from source code are automatically available in your
workspace (on next restart of Eclipse if you merged new extensions while Eclipse was running).</p>

<p>Binary extensions (Eclipse extensions in Portage ending with <tt>-bin</tt>) must be added once
per user, using the following steps:</p>

<p>For 3.0.x:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>Help -> Software Updates -> Manage Configuration...</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Right click on "Eclipse Platform" in the left tree view, select <tt>New -> Extension Location</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Enter <tt>"/opt/eclipse-extensions-3"</tt> and accept to restart Eclipse</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For 2.1.x:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>Help -> Software Updates -> Update Manager...</tt></p></li>
<li><p>In the "Feature Updates" window, browse to <tt>/opt/eclipse-extensions-2</tt></p></li>
<li><p>Right-click on the "eclipse" subnode and select "Link Product Extension"</p></li>
<li><p>Accept the restarting of Eclipse</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Details on extensions</h3>

<p>The features and plugins managed by Portage, however, will be installed in fixed locations.</p>

<p>All extensions that are compiled entirely from source code will be installed into the main Eclipse
library, located in <tt>/usr/lib/eclipse-2</tt> (or <tt>-3</tt>).</p>

<p>All extensions where the .jar files are installed as-is, so-called binary packages, will be
installed into <tt>/opt/eclipse-extensions-2</tt> (or <tt>-3</tt>).</p>

<p>This means that any from-source extension will be automatically available inside your Eclipse environment,
but you must explicitly link the directory <tt>/usr/eclipse-extensions-2</tt> into your workspace using the
Update Manager if you want to avail yourself of the binary extensions.</p>

<p>This linking only needs to be done once for every workspace. New binaries will automatically show up when
merged after the initial link has been set up.</p>

<h3>Writing ebuilds for extensions</h3>

<p>We very much welcome user-submitted ebuilds for Eclipse extensions.</p>

<p>To ease the maintenance of these extensions, a new ebuild needs to avail itself of the
<tt>eclipse-ext</tt> eclass.</p>

<p>Submitted ebuilds should strive to compile the extension from source code. Especially if is reliant on
architecture-specific binary code, or the actual UI (gtk vs motif) it is running on, it <b>must</b> compile
the extension entirely from sources (yes, yes, we're trying fix the CDT;).</p>

<p>For examples, look at <tt class="pkg">dev-util/ecletex</tt> for a from-source extension and
<tt class="pkg">dev-util/eclipse-gef-bin</tt> for a binary-only extension.</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>Eclipse is currently maintained by the Java herd in general, and by me in particular.</p>

<p>If you have problems, try contacting us on <tt>#gentoo-java</tt> on irc.freenode.net or subscribe and mail
your woes to <a href="mailto:gentoo-java@lists.gentoo.org">gentoo-java@lists.gentoo.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you think you've found a bug, report it through <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</a>. This way,
it will be properly tracked and handled when I'm on vacation (as I'm wont to;) or otherwise busy.</p>
