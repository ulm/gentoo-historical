# This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be performed. It
# should be followed by one or more lookup methods, separated by
# commas.  Valid methods are bind, hosts, and nis.

order hosts, bind

# Valid  values are on and off.  If set to on, the resolv+ library
# will return all valid addresses for a host that appears  in  the
# /etc/hosts  file,  instead  of  only  the first.  This is off by
# default, as it may cause a substantial performance loss at sites
# with large hosts files.
