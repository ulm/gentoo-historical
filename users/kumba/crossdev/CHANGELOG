crossdev-0.5
  (25 Oct 2004)
  - Too many flippin' changes to even try and recall.  Most of these were
	minor bug fixes.
  - Added s390, sh, arm, Amtel AVR support.  Probably others too, can't recall :)
  - Added method to allow user to control how source trees are copied
  - Added support for 2.6 headers
  - Added trick to remove -lgcc_eh usage from glibc-2.3.3/2.3.4
  - Added Overwrite support (--overwrite).  Allows overwriting an existing toolchain.
  - Added NPTL support (--nptl).  Builds an nptl-aware glibc.  Not all archs support this.
  - Lots of Code cleanup, 'if' statement shrinkage, readability improvements, etc..
  - crossdev-status now generates table's properly no matter the number of archs-per-column (This was fun)
