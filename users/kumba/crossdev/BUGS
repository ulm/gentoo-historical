Known Bugs:

1. When full cross-compilers (those with a compiled glibc) are in $PATH, the 
   native system "ldd" tool will not function.  Remove the cross-compiler(s)
   from $PATH to fix.

   Affected Versions: crossdev-0.2, crossdev-0.3
   Status: Not Fixed

2. gcc-3.3.2-r4 in Gentoo's Portage *may* fail on building due to a
   (possible?) bug in gcc's make system.  It relates to gcc looking 
   in the install directory for headers in "sys-include", which are 
   copied from /usr/include on the host system during gcc-bootstrap. 
   However, gcc looks  one too many directories down, then tries to 
   look back up (dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/../../../../targetdir), and 
   fails to find sys-include, and triggers a make failure.

   Affected Versions: crossdev-0.2, crossdev-0.3
   Status: FIXED - Bug appears to have fixed itself.
