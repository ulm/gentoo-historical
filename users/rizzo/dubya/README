dubya

A collection of quotes from George W. Bush.

Fortune-ized by Don Seiler, don@seiler.us from the desk
calendar "They Misunderestimated Me!: The Very Curious Language
of George W. Bush" -- http://www.bushcalendar.com

Also from http://www.dubyaspeak.com.

Install dubya and dubya.dat into your fortune directory, usually
this is /usr/share/fortune/.

The dubya.dat file is created by the program "strfile".  If you add more
quotes of your own, just rebuild it by:

    strfile dubya dubya.dat

Assuming that "dubya" is the text file full of quotes, separated by "%" lines.
Be sure to delete the old dubya.dat file first.  New quotes are always
welcome!  Just send them, as well as corrections, to the email above.
