  09 September 2003; John Davis <zhen@gentoo.org>: Initial import of hardened stager.
  I am forking this from the original stager code in order to better fit our needs.
  The original stager code is still used by Gentoo, and is maintained by Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>.
  I would like to thank him and the rest of the contributors that coded stager.
