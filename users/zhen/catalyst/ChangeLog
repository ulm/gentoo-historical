  21 Sep 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> README.catalyst, catalyst:
  I edited catalyst to change our naming convention from stage*-arch-h.* to
  stage*-arch-etdyn-ssp.* re method's request. This will not be the first time
  I change naming conventions, as catalyst will be eventually extended to
  do selinux-* stages also.
  
  Additionally, I updated README.catalyst to include profile information.

  10 Sep 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> README.catalyst, README.stager, bin/catalyst,
  bin/hardened-bootstrap.sh, bin/stage1:
  I renamed README.stager to README.catalyst and have made some very minor
  changes to it. bin/bootstrap.sh has been renamed to bin/hardened-bootstrap.sh.
  I have hacked bootstrap to use the hardened profile, as well as utilize
  hardened-gcc. bin/catalyst itself has undergone some more changes (nothing too
  major). Additionally, bin/stage1 has been hacked to accept the hardened profile,
  and use hardened-gcc.

  09 September 2003; John Davis <zhen@gentoo.org>: Initial import of hardened stager.
  I am forking this from the original stager code in order to better fit our needs.
  The original stager code is still used by Gentoo, and is maintained by Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>.
  I would like to thank him and the rest of the contributors that coded stager.
