History: 

04/30/05: mcummings@gentoo.org
	Moving g-cpan into its own package space withing app-portage for better managability.
	Also, this breaks the tie to g-cpan fixes being reliant on the next release of portage.

01/29/05: andrew-g@oxhut.co.uk: 
	Improved filename/version matching to close bugs 64403 74149 69464 23951.  
	Improved default help message.  Added -v verbose flag.

11/16/04: pete@peteleonard.com:
	Fixed handling of CPAN modules that end in '.pm' (e.g. CGI.pm)
	Closes bug 64403.

10/29/04: rac@gentoo.org:
	attempt to recognize lowercased packages in dev-perl in portage_dir

05/23/03: jrray@gentoo.org: 
	Skip modules the CPAN thinks are included with perl (closes bug 14679).

	Used the CPAN module to discover the real location of Makefile.PL to set
	the ${S} variable in the ebuild, sometimes the location isn't the same as
	${P}.
	
	Don't assume the filename of the tarball will be ${P}.tar.gz, use the
	real filename out of CPAN.
	
	Some modules' filenames have underscores in unfortunate places.  Change
	all of them to hyphens to avoid that mess.

02/23/03: alain@gentoo.org: 
	removed portage direct-access code, and switched to using the
	portageq utility which hides the portage APIs.

01/08/03: jrray@gentoo.org: 
	remove dependency on Digest::MD5

01/07/03: jrray@gentoo.org: getting the way subroutines are fed variables
	sorted out (they're in @_)
	Clean out module_check, unnecessary temp variables are evil.
	It isn't okay to skip a module if module_check succeeds when
	that module is listed as a dependency for a module we're trying
	to install, the subsequent emerge can fail if the ebuild doesn't
	exist.  So only skip a module if it is a first order module from
	the command line but not if it is being considered to meet a
	dependency.
	Use the portage python module to learn some configuration values
	instead of trying to parse make.conf.
	Need to use system and not exec when calling out to emerge, exec
	ends our process!

12/09/02: baz@bluefuton.com: some further amends:
	standardised code, declared external vars early, 
	amended layout and sub styles for consistency and brevity,
	also removed a 'spare' function :-)

12/07/02: mcummings: Reviewed baz's comments (thanks!). Moved the make.conf check to an external
	 sub so that we could grab other important functions. Added Digest::MD5 so that we could
	 check the checksum more cleanly instead of making a system call.
	 Thanks to stocke2 for pointing me in the direction of File::Path -
	 and helping me debug silly michael coding with rmtree

12/07/02: baz@bluefuton.com: 
	comments added, basically a very picky code review.

12/06/02: mcummings; 
	Added emerge functionality. Now emerges modules on the 
	fly

12/03/02: mcummings; 
	Added checks for /var/db/pkg and manually installed 
	modules

11/07/02: jrray : Initial upload to bug 3450
