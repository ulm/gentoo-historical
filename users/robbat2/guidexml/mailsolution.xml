            <body>
                <p>For the purposes of this guide, we assume that you have only
                    a basic mail setup in Gentoo at this point, such as only
                    SSMTP or Nullmailer.</p>
                <p>If this is not the case, you may have to adapt some of the
                    instructions.</p>

            <title>Removing your old MTA</title>
            <body>
                <p>Every Gentoo system has an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)
                    installed by default. SSMTP is the default for most
                    platforms, but Nullmailer is also becoming more common.</p>
                <p>We need to remove the existing MTA before we can install a
                    new one.</p>

<pre caption="Checking for obstructing MTA's">
# <i>emerge -p qmail</i>

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:

Calculating dependencies ...done!
[blocks B     ] net-mail/ssmtp ("virtual/mta" from pkg net-mail/qmail-1.03-r12)
[ebuild  N    ] net-mail/qmail-1.03-r12
<codenote>(The above output may be somewhat different depending on what you have installed already)</codenote>
</pre>

<p>Ok, so we can see that we have <e>net-mail/ssmtp</e> 
installed and it's blocking us from installing qmail. We
don't want SSMTP, so lets get rid of it!</p>

<pre caption="Removing obstructing MTA's">
# <i>emerge -C ssmtp</i>

 net-mail/ssmtp
    selected: 2.60.4
   protected: none
     omitted: none
<codenote>(output from removing here)</codenote>
</pre>

<p>We have now removed SSMTP from our system. At this point NO
email is being delivered on the system.</p>

<title>USE flags and ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</title>
<body>
    <p>This document assumes that you have the following USE flags enabled:
        <c>mysql pam nls fam ssl</c>. You may also be interested in the
        <c>clearpasswd</c> USE flag. By default, vpopmail will not store
        cleartext passwords, however as a sysadmin, you may wish to have
        cleartext passwords in the database for debugging and reference.
        <e>(Possibly cleartext passwords required for (CRAM|DIGEST)-MD5
            ?)</e></p>

    <p>This document deals with &gt;=net-mail/qmail-1.03-r12,
        &gt;=net-mail/courier-imap-2.1.2-r1 presently. These packages are in
        ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" and as such they are not available to x86 yet.</p>

            </title>
            <body>
                <p>Now that our system is ready for it, let's install qmail!</p>
<pre caption="Emerging qmail">
# <i>emerge qmail</i>
<codenote>(At this point qmail and all of it's dependancies will be installed)</codenote>
<codenote>...</codenote>
 * To setup qmail to run out-of-the-box on your system, run:
 * ebuild /var/db/pkg/net-mail/qmail-1.03-r12/qmail-1.03-r12.ebuild config

 * To start qmail at boot you have to add svscan to your startup
 * and create the following links :
 * ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send /service/qmail-send
 * ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd /service/qmail-smtpd

 * To start the pop3 server as well, create the following link :
 * ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d /service/qmail-pop3d

 * Additionally, the QMTP and QMQP protocols are supported, and can be started as:
 * ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-qmtpd /service/qmail-qmtpd
 * ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-qmqpd /service/qmail-qmqpd

 * Additionally, if you wish to run qmail right now, you should run this before anything else:
 * source /etc/profile
<codenote>...</codenote>
</pre>

<p>For the moment, we are going to ignore most of these instructions, as we want to do a bit more setup first, and avoid restarting qmail.</p>

<pre caption="Setting up qmail">

Your fully qualified host name is cherenkov-int.
Putting <i>$hostname</i> into control/me...
Putting <i>$hostname</i> into control/defaultdomain...
Putting <i>$hostname</i> into control/plusdomain...
Putting <i>$hostname</i> into control/locals...
Putting <i>$hostname</i> into control/rcpthosts...
Now qmail will refuse to accept SMTP messages except to <i>$hostname</i>.
Make sure to change rcpthosts if you add hosts to locals or virtualdomains!
 * Accepting relaying by default from all ips configured on this machine.

Creating a self-signed ssl-cert:
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
..........................++++++
.................++++++
writing new private key to '//var/qmail/control/servercert.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
<codenote>The following values are for MY location, you should enter your own details instead!</codenote>
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:<i>CA</i>
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:<i>British Columbia</i>
Locality Name (eg, city) []:<i>Burnaby</i>
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:<i>Orbis-Terrarum Networks</i>
<codenote>I recommend that you leave this value at "Qmail SMTP server" due to the nature of SSL certificates</codenote>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:<i>Qmail SMTP server</i>
<codenote>This MUST be a hostname that resolves to the IP of your server</codenote>
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:<i>mail.orbis-terrarum.net</i>
<codenote>These should be the address of the person administering the server</codenote>
Email Address []:<i>robbat2@orbis-terrarum.net</i>
 * If You want to have a signed cert, do the following:
 * openssl req -new -nodes -out req.pem \
 * -keyout /var/qmail/control/servercert.pem
 * Send req.pem to your CA to obtain signed_req.pem, and do:
 * cat signed_req.pem >> /var/qmail/control/servercert.pem
</pre>
<note>Qmail's is fussy in that it doesn't let simple self-signed certificates
get used for SSL/TLS communications, the certificate has to be signed by some
CA, and you need to give it all of the certifcate chain in a single
file. Due to this, I leave it out for the moment.</note>
