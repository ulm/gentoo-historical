ipv6-rc-scripts
---------------

What is is:
----------
Gentoo's current initscript handle the co-existance of ipv4 and ipv6 *very* poorly. a more robust handling is needed.
the patch in here is against the current stable rc-scripts tarball by azarah.

What it does:
-------------
Creates a new layer for an interface, by means of an "iface.eth?" script which handles the "physical" bring up and down of a device, and creating a tunnel, etc.

We also now have net.ethX and net6.ethX with an associated provide of "net" and "net6" so services can depend on one or the other or both. They should now be able to behave mostly independantly.


********WARNING*************
This has not been throroughly tested, or even tested at all in some cases. This is merely me messing with things, hoping it results in a robust implementation.


What you can do:
---------------
Read the patch. apply it. Look at it and see if it makes sense. if you're brave. emerge it.
