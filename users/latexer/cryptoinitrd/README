cryptoinitrd -

Script to create an initrd suitable for having a cryptolooped / partition.

********* WARNING **************
Having an encrypted / partition is *obviously* a tricky thing.
I make no guarantees this script works yet, or ever will!
********** WARNING *************

That said, please test this out. Easiest way to test this would be to place
cryptoinitrd somewhere in the path on a liveCD, and put linuxrc in
${GENTOO_ROOT}/usr/share/cryptoinitrd-0.1/

Before starting a gentoo install, setup whatever partitions you want encrypted as cryptolooped devices. Check out
http://www.kerneli.org/ for instructions on how to do this. basically:

modprobe cryptoloop
modprobe cryptoapi
modprobe loop
modprobe cipher-X
losetup -e X /dev/loop0 /dev/hda1
<Enter keysize and passphrase. !CAREFUL! only asks for the passphrase once!>
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/loop0
mount -t ext3 /dev/loop0 /mnt/gentoo

Now continue w/ the rest of the installation of gentoo on /mnt/gentoo. 

KERNEL -

Use one of the kernel's w/ the cryptoapi patches, and make sure USE="crypt"

Make sure you have 
CONFIG_CRYPTO=m
CONFIG_CIPHERS=m
CONFIG_CRYPTODEV=m
CONFIG_CRYPTOLOOP=m

set, and select some cipher to use. (i use blowfish. to each their own)

After finishing the install, exit your chroot, and edit the cryptoinitrd script to change some of the variables in the top to point to the right spot. Next run the script, entering the requested information. type "cryptoinitrd help" for a breif explination of how to use the script.

This will create an initrd.gz in whatever tmp directory you chose. Setup grub/lilo to point to this initrd, and then pray.... GOOD LUCK.
