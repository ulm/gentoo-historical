Abstract
========

Currently, multilib profiles like amd64 do support other targets, but there
is no simple way to build packages for those seperate targets.  A workaround
for this issue are emul packages, which contain precompiled 32bit libs.  
This GLEP extends the package manager to allow the user to build packages
from source for targets supported by the profile and toolchain.  


Motivation
==========

There is no way to build a package for a target other than the default target
for a given profile. It would be useful if the package manager and ebuilds were
extended to build for multiple targets when enabled by the user. This would
allow users to build 32-bit and 64-bit packages on amd64 for example. The
existing system is a set of 32-bit 'emul' packages that contain precompiled
32-bit copies of 'useful' libraries. Also of note is that other distributions
like Debian have multilib support.


Specification
=============

A new EAPI (4_multilib) will extend the functionality of package managers. In
EAPI 4_multilib packages will have additional USE flags created via USE_EXPAND.
A given profile will declare its targets:

USE_EXPEND="multilib_abi"
MULTILIB_API="x86 amd64"

Exmaple:

profile: amd64/multilib
package dev-libs/a uses the future EAPI
package app-misc/b requires 32bit libs from dev-libs/a
It can now define this in the dependency section as following:
DEPEND="dev-libs/a[multilib_abi_x86]"

In EAPI 4_multilib the package manager will expose a USE flag for all packages
called 'abiwrapper'. The purpose of abiwrapper is to enable users to have more
than one installed binary, such as one binary per target. The abiwrapper flag
will hint to the package manager to install binaries with a suffix of the
target abi. The package manager will also install an 'abiwrapper' at the normal
binary location that selects the correct binary to run based on the abi in the
'ABI' environment variable.

For instance:
Installed: dev-util/gdb[multilib_abi_x86,multilib_abi_amd64]

/usr/bin/gdb-amd64
/usr/bin/gdb-x86
/usr/bin/gdb -> /bin/abiwrapper 

Rationale
=========

The proposal does add USE flags for each supported target ABI.  This allows
the user to select per package, if he wants to compile it for the default
target, additionally for another target or just for another target.  
An alternative would have been a global variable defining this support for
all packages at once. This was not done, because it would force the user
to either build all (even unneeded packages) or nothing with additional or
different target support without the ability to choose on a per package level.


The proposel does add a USE flag called "abiwrapper" to control the
behaviour for binaries.  If this flag is enabled and there is a none-default
target enabled, the binaries for each target are preserved and installed
with their target as suffix.  A symlink is created for the binary name to a
wrapper, which does execute the real binary based on a set environment
variable.  Following alternative implementations have not been selected:

* no wrapper: This would mean, that the installed binaries change, depending
  on the selected targets. Since some binaries have target specific output,
  this would reduce the possible targets for depending packages.
* a variable to control the packages with wrapped binaries: This has the
  same effect as a USE flag, but requires the user to look into an additional
  location to see, if a package gets wrapped binaries or not.


If a package has dependencies, then those dependencies are required to have
at least the same targets enabled as the package. This makes sure, that
the needed libs for that target do exist.  The alternative to go without
those dependencies was not choosen, because this would result in compile
failures due to missing libs for the specified target and in the need for
the user to manually find the needed libs and to install them with the needed
target.


An enabled USE flag called "multilib" does restrict any cross-compilation
and compiles and installs the package for the default target.  The added
USE flags still exist, but are ignored.  This allows packages to do their
own cross-compilation without conflicting with this feature.  The
alternative to not have such a flag would make it much harder for certain
packages (e.g. gcc, glibc or linux-headers) to be transferred to this
future EAPI.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

To allow packages, which already compile and/or install files for different
targets, to use this future EAPI, the multilib USE flag is used as a special
flag to indicate, that this package already does the needed steps, so that
the package manager wont attempt to additionally do this.

Further backward compatibility issues are not known.


Reference Implementation
========================

A reference implementation is done in a portage branch. The code can be
found at [#1].
An overlay containing an ebuild and the needed profile details can be
found via layman.  It is called "multilib-portage".  The docs dir contains
basic setup instructions.  For help with this overlay, ask in [#2].
A stage 4 qemu image can be found on the Gentoo distfiles mirrors [#3].
