# This is not an eclass, but it does provide emacs-related
# installation utilities.
#
# USAGE:
#
# Usually you want to use this eclass for (optional) GNU Emacs support
# of your package.	This is NOT for XEmacs!
#  Many of the steps here are sometimes done by the build system of
# your package (especially compilation), so this is mainly for standalone
# elisp files you gathered from somewhere else!
#  When relying on the emacs USE flag, you need to add
#
#		emacs? ( virtual/emacs )
#
# to your DEPEND/RDEPEND line and use the functions provided
# here to bring the files to the correct locations.
#  An elisp file is compiled by the elisp-compile() function defined here
# and simply takes the source files as arguments. In the case of on each
# other depinding elisp files, you can use the elisp-comp() function
# which makes sure all files are loadable.
#
#		elisp-compile *.el || die "elisp-compile failed!"
# or
#		elisp-comp *.el || die "elisp-comp failed!"
#
#  The resulting compiled files (.elc) should be put in a subdirectory of
# /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ which is named after the first argument
# of elisp-install().  The following parameters are the files to be put in
# that directory.  Usually the subdirectory should be ${PN}, you can choose
# something else, but remember to tell elisp-site-file-install() (see below)
# the change, as it defaults to ${PN}!
#
#		elisp-install ${PN} *.elc *.el || die "elisp-install failed!"
#
#  To let the Emacs support be activated by Emacs on startup, you need
# to provide a site file (shipped in ${FILESDIR}) which contains the startup
# code (have a look in the documentation of your software).	Normally this
# would look like this:
#
#		;;; binclock site-lisp configuration
#
#		(add-to-list 'load-path "@SITELISP@")
#		(require 'binclock)
#
#  If your Emacs support files are installed in a subdirectory of
# /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ (which is recommended), you need to extend
# Emacs' load-path as shown in the first non-comment.  Where the
# "@SITELISP@" is replaced with the actual path by the elisp-site-file-install()
# function of this eclass.
#  The naming scheme for this site file is "[0-9][0-9]*-gentoo.el", where the
# two digits at the beginning define the loading order.	 So if you depend
# on another Emacs package, your site file's number must be higher!
#  Best practise is to define a SITEFILE variable in the global scope of
# your ebuild (right after DEPEND e.g.):
#
#		SITEFILE=50binclock-gentoo.el
#
#  Which is then installed by
#
#		elisp-site-file-install "${FILESDIR}/${SITEFILE}"
#
# in src_install().	 If your subdirectory is not named ${PN}, give the differing
# name as second argument.
#  After that you need to recreate the start-up file of Emacs after emerging
# and unmerging by using
#
#		pkg_postinst() {
#			elisp-site-regen
#		}
#		pkg_postrm() {
#			elisp-site-regen
#		}
#
#  As always: Feel free to contact Emacs team through emacs@gentoo.org if you have
# problems, suggestions or questions.

All site initialization for Gentoo-installed packages is now added to
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo.el; site-start.el is no longer
managed by Gentoo. You are responsible for all maintenance of
site-start.el if there is such a file.

In order for this site initialization to be loaded for all users
automatically, as was done previously, you can add a line like this:

	(load "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo")

to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el.  Alternatively, that line
can be added by individual users to their initialization files, or for
greater flexibility, users can select which of the package-specific
initialization files in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp to load.
