Put stages in the stages directory,
make sure the config directory is all set ok,
run ./livecd build

should you manually abort the script check mounts before rm -rf
the if the livecd script aborts for some reason, you can manually fix the problem and 
rerun ./livecd build, the building will continue where it stopped (depending on how bad the error was)


Check livecd script for extra arguments 

initrd: 	rebuilds the initrd (copies in kernel modules from loop)
rebuild_loop: 	recreates the loop filesystem from possibly modified ./loop
rebuild: 	rebuilds the iso file from possibly modified ./iso (copy in necessary stages or docs manually)
burn:		burns the iso to your ATAPI cdrom
