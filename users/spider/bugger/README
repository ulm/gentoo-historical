You will need to emerge/make sure you have the following ebuilds:

dev-perl/config-general
dev-perl/libwww-perl
dev-perl/WWW-Bugzilla

If emerge WWW-Bugzilla's dep WWW-Mechanize prompts you, then you tree is
slightly out of date. This *was* fixed, promise. There was even a bug on it. 
Submitted via bugger. =;-)

and run...


---------------
For those wanting to contribute, some thoughts (and things I will be tackling if
no one else does). Just update this README for now (or create a spiffy TODO 
file). Thanks and report all bugs! Unless its bugger unable to report a bug, 
then email me...

* I'm open to cleaning up the HTML parsing by including one of the more fitting
perl modules, suggestions welcome. I was just trying to keep the number of 
external deps at a minumum, though really dev-perl/HTML-Parser is already in the
tree. 
* The use of Config::General was intended for ultimately being able to store
multiple bugzilla accounts and to be able to interface with them as necessary, 
with one being marked as default (each with a server,login,password).
* I was in a rush, so I didn't have time to play with the Term:: namespace for 
hiding the password on the command line - a must if this were ever to be used in
the real world.
* Code for downloading attachments should be easy enough if anyone wants to
attack that
* Related to the Term:: stuff, I'd *love* to see something more elegant than
<STDIN> being used, I just don't do enough command line interaction.
* More options (with defaults) for creating and updating bugs, like severity, 
etc., would be good to have.

And finally: One goal in all of this is not to end up with just a pretty lynx. 
Personally, I shy away from the curses/dialog interfaces because I want to be 
sure this is as usable as possible with a minimum of bells and whistles.
