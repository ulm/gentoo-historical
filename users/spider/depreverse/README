 This is a really hacky tool  / project of mine.
 deplister will take a -list- of files on standard input, and outputs a -list- of files on standard output.

 This can be easily wrapped, see "finder.sh" for more details. Code license is GPL v2,  Encouraged to spread, copyright of DmD (Spider) Ljungmark, spider@gentoo.org, some parts copyright elsewhere ( perl.req was snipped from the rpm package)

 So, what is it for?  Basically its a brute-force attempt to grabbing the "real" dependencies of a package.

 example :
./finder.sh gtk2-perl
Thinking about gtk2-perl..
dev-lang/perl
dev-libs/atk
dev-libs/expat
dev-libs/glib
dev-perl/glib-perl
dev-perl/gtk2-perl
media-libs/fontconfig
media-libs/freetype
sys-libs/glibc
sys-libs/zlib
x11-base/xorg-x11
x11-libs/gtk+
x11-libs/pango


Nifty, sorta ;)

The attack is brute-force approach. parse each file, determine the type, and classify it. This can easily be optimized further, and split apart nicely.  Currently it expects to be ran in the working directory, and calls "./filename" when it does. Hardcoded.

Expects you to have gentoolkit installed, as well.


NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
This is -NOT- foolproof, 100% correct.
It -cannot- grasp the concept of conditional import in python, dlopen () , executed software from inside shellscripts. 
It probably doesn't capture all perl depends either,  asking mcummings here.

This code -NEEDS- to be cleaned out to be proper, however its a decent start.
