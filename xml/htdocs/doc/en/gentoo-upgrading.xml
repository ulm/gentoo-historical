<title>Gentoo and Upgrades</title>
<section>
<title>Philosophy</title>
<body>

<p>
Here in Gentoo land, the concept of upgrading is quite different compared to 
the rest of the Linux world.  You probably already know that we never got in 
touch with the "classic" way of upgrading software: waiting for a new release, 
downloading it, burning, putting it in the cdrom drive and then following the 
upgrade instructions.
</p>

<p>
You know (being a Gentoo user after all) that this process is extremely 
frustrating for power users that want to live on the bleeding edge.  Even power 
users from other distributions probably share the same feelings, given the 
popularity and spread of tools like apt or apt-rpm which make it 
possible to have quick and frequent updates.  However, no distibution is more 
suited than Gentoo to satisfy these kind of demanding users.  From the 
beginning, Gentoo was designed around the concept of fast, incremental 
updates.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, you install once and never bother with releases: just follow the
instructions in <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1">A Portage
Introduction</uri> in the <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/">Gentoo Handbook</uri>
that explain how to keep your system up to date.  While that's the way things
usually go, sometimes changes are made to the core system which require updates
to be done manually.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<title>Releases and Profiles</title>
<body>

<p>
A recurring question about the Gentoo release process is: "Why roll out new
releases frequently, if they are not intended to let users update software?".
There are various reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A new release means new LiveCDs with bugfixes and more features.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new release provides an updated set of GRP packages, so that users that
    choose "the fast way" to install (stage3 + precompiled packages) end up
    with a system that is not outdated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, a new release may, from time to time, implement some features that
    are incompatible with previous releases.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
When a release includes new incompatible features, or provides a set of core
packages and settings that deeply modify the behavior of the system, we say 
that it provides a new <e>profile</e>.
</p>

<p>
A <e>profile</e> is a set of configuration files, stored in a subdirectory of
<path>/usr/portage/profiles</path>, that describe things such as the ebuilds
that are considered <e>system</e> packages, the default USE flags, the default
mapping for virtual packages, and the architecture on which the system is running.
</p>

<p>
The profile in use is determined by the symbolic link
<path>/etc/make.profile</path>, which points to a subdirectory of
<path>/usr/portage/profiles</path> which holds the profile files.  For 
instance, the x86 2004.2 profile can be found at 
<path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-x86-2004.2</path> (old-style location) or 
at <path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/2004.2</path> (new-style 
location - only for use with Portage 2.0.51 and later).  With respect to 
new-style profile directories, note that the files in 
parent directories are part of the profile (and are therefore shared 
by different subprofiles).
</p>

<p>
Profiles obsoleted by new ones are kept in <path>/usr/portage/profiles</path>
along with the current ones, but they are marked as deprecated.  When that 
happens a file named <path>deprecated</path> is put in the profile directory.
The content of this file is the name of the profile that should be "upgraded 
to"; portage uses this information to automatically warn you when you should 
update to a new profile.
</p>

<p>
There are various reasons that a new profile may be created: the release of 
new versions of core packages (such as <c>baselayout</c>, <c>gcc</c>, or 
<c>glibc</c>) that are incompatible with previous versions, a change in 
the default USE flags or in the virtual mappings, or maybe a change in 
system-wide settings (such as defining udev to be the default manager 
for <path>/dev</path> instead of devfs).

<title>Keeping up with new releases</title>
<section>
<title>Releases without profile changes</title>
<body>

<p>
If a new Gentoo release is announced that does not include a new profile (such
as the 2004.1 release for x86), then you can safely pretend that it never 
happened :).
</p>

<p>
If you update your installed packages 
<uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1">as explained in
the Gentoo Handbook</uri>, then your system will be exactly the same as one
that has been installed using the new release.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Releases with profile changes</title>
<body>

<p>
If a release introduces a new profile, you have the choice to migrate to the 
new profile.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, you are not forced to do so, and you can continue to use the old 
profile and just update your packages
<uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1">as explained 
in the Gentoo Handbook</uri>.
</p>

<p>
However, Gentoo strongly recommends updating your profile if it becomes 
deprecated.  When this happens, it means that Gentoo developers no longer
plan on supporting it. Using the table below, you can quickly check to 
see what profiles are currently supported.
</p>

<p>
If you decide to migrate to the new profile, then you will have to manually
perform the update.  The way you update may vary significantly from release 
to release; it depends on how deep the modifications introduced in the new
profile are.
</p>

<p>
In the simplest case you only have to change the <path>/etc/make.profile</path>
symlink, in the worst case you may have to recompile your system from scratch
while doing a neat voodoo dance.  Migration is usually covered in the release
notes (e.g. <uri 
link="/proj/en/releng/release/2004.3/x86-release-notes.xml">the x86 2004.3
release notes</uri>). You can also find <uri
link="#instructions">instructions</uri> at the end of this guide.

<title>Updating to 2004.3</title>
<body>

<p>
With the introduction of the 2004.3 profiles, users are not going to see huge
modifications of their systems (see below for details). However, Gentoo
developers decided to push out this new profile and to deprecate quite a few of
the old ones to speed up the adoption of <e>stacked profiles</e>, that is, the
profiles that follow the new layout of the <path>/usr/portage/profiles</path>
directory, for instance
<path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/x86/2004.3</path> (supported by
Portage 2.0.51 or later).
</p>

<p>
To switch to the 2004.3 profile, point the <path>/etc/make.profile</path>
symlink to the new location:
</p>

<warn>
Don't forget to upgrade Portage <e>before</e> you change your profile!!!
</warn>

<pre caption="Updating the /etc/make.profile symlink">
<comment>substitute &lt;arch&gt; with your arch</comment>
# <i>rm /etc/make.profile</i>
# <i>ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/&lt;arch&gt;/2004.3 /etc/make.profile</i>
</pre>

<p>
<b>All archs</b> - As said above, there are no big changes introduced in this
profile. However, it should be noted that <c>sys-apps/slocate</c> and
<c>net-misc/dhcpcd</c> are no longer considered system packages. This means
that if you run <c>emerge --depclean</c>, Portage will try to remove them from
your system. If you need any of those packages, add them to
<path>/var/lib/portage/world</path> after the profile switch, or manually
emerge them.
</p>

<p>
<b>ppc</b> - <c>sys-fs/udev</c> is now the default instead of 
<c>sys-fs/devfs</c> for newly installed machines. This has no 
effect on already installed machines, though.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Updating to 2004.2</title>
<body>

<p>
To switch to the 2004.2 profile, point the <path>/etc/make.profile</path> 
symlink to the new location:
</p>

<warn>
Don't forget to upgrade Portage <e>before</e> you change your profile!!!
</warn>

<pre caption="Updating the /etc/make.profile symlink">
<comment>substitute &lt;arch&gt; with your arch</comment>
# <i>rm /etc/make.profile</i>
# <i>ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/&lt;arch&gt;/2004.2 /etc/make.profile</i>
</pre>

<p>
<b>x86</b> - This profile changes the default X11 implementation from
<c>x11-base/xfree</c> to <c>x11-base/xorg-x11</c>.  This change only touches
the <e>default</e> value, and is only relevant for those who have not installed
an X server yet.  If you already have one installed, then it will not affect
you at all; you are free to switch from one X server to the other exactly as
before.
</p>

<p>
<b>amd64</b> - There are no fundamental changes from previous profiles, no
specific action needs to be performed.
</p>

<section>
<title>Updating to 2004.0</title>
<body>

<p>
To switch to the 2004.0 profile, point the <path>/etc/make.profile</path> 
symlink to the new location:
</p>

<pre caption="Updating the /etc/make.profile symlink">
<comment>substitute &lt;arch&gt; with your arch</comment>
# <i>rm /etc/make.profile</i>
# <i>ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-&lt;arch&gt;-2004.0 /etc/make.profile</i>

<b>All archs</b> - There are no fundamental changes from previous profiles, no
