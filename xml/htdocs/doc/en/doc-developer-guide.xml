<abstract>
	This guide is a HOWTO for the Gentoo Linux Documentation Team.
	This guide will cover all of the basics of writing documentation
	for the Gentoo Linux Project, and it will be a contact point
	for new developers.

			<p>If you are reading this guide, then you are either a new documentation developer, or someone that wishes
			to contribute to the project. First, I would like to thank you for contributing to the Gentoo Linux project.
			Part of our goal is to create documentation that is easily accesible to the public. Our format is easily
			learned, so you will not have a hard time with the XML language. For more information on our XML format,
			please go <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">here</uri>.

	<title>Formatting Conventions</title>
		<section>
			<title>Formatting</title>
			<body>

			<p>Just like any well written program, it is very important that some formatting conventions are
			followed while writing Gentoo Linux Documentation. Let's start at the beginning of the document.
			<e>Every</e> document that is written for the Gentoo Linux project must have these headers at the
			top.
			</p>

				"<pre caption = "Required Headers">"
				"<?xml version='1.0' encoding="UTF-8"?>"
				"<?xml-stylesheet href="/xsl/guide.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>"
				"<!DOCTYPE guide SYSTEM "/dtd/guide.dtd">"
				</pre>

			<p>The first line ensures that the interpreter knows what version of XML it has to translate and what
			character encoding scheme it has to use. I will discuss character encoding later in this guide, but 
			as of November 2002, <e>all</e> Gentoo Linux documentation is to adopt the UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding
			scheme. </p>

			<p>The second line is for our on-the-fly XML website conversion engine. It points to our main XSL
			translation template, and it specifies what is being encoded. 
			</p>

			<p>The third line specifies the path where the DTD conversion sheet is. An explanation of the definition
			of a DTD Guide is out of the scope of this document, but if you are inquiring, you can check 
			Daniel Robbins' XML/XSL guides that he wrote for IBM Developer Works. Those articles are linked
			off of the main <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org">gentoo.org</uri> page.
			</p>

			<p>The next line is very important. This sets the location of the document, and it must be set.
			</p>

			<note>This is the opening guide tag, check the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">
				XML guide for more information. 
			</note>
			
			<pre caption = "Guide Link">
			<comment>Replace x with the name of your document. </comment>
			"<guide link = "/doc/your_country_code/x.xml>"
			</pre>

			<p>All "<pre>" tags are to have captions that adequately describe their contents.
			</p>

			<pre caption = "Examples">
			"<pre caption = "This is what is in my pre>"
			</pre>

			<p>Like any well-written programming code, it is expected of documentation developers to properly
			indent their XML code. This has not been done much in the past, but it needs to be done in the future.
			This increases readability, and it is Just Good Programming (tm) practice.
			</p>

			<p>Organize your document. Coordinate your main points and sub points. Documentation that comes
			from Gentoo is to be professionaly laid out. Not only does this look good, it helps overall 
			readability. Make good use of Chapter/Section delineation, it makes navigation by the drop down
			box very easy.
			</p>

			<p><e>MOST IMPORTANTLY</e>, read the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">
			Gentoo XML Guide</uri>. There is a lot of important information contained within, and it should
			be read by <i>anybody</i> writing Gentoo Linux Documentation.
