		<title>Introduction</title>
		<body>
			<p>USB under GNU/Linux has always been a fairly easy, but undocumented,
			task. Users are often confused on whether or not to use modules,
			what the difference between UHCI, OHCI, and EHCI is, and why in the world
			their USB device X is not working. I hope to alleviate some of those problems
			in this guide by enlightening the user on the different aspects of the GNU/Linux
			USB system.
			</p>

			<p>While writing this guide, I assume that you are familiar with how to compile
			your kernel, as well as the basic operation of Gentoo Linux. For more information on
			these subjects, please visit our <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/en/docs-index.xml">
			Documentation Index</uri>, which catalogs our current set of Gentoo specific documentation.

	<title>USB via the Linux Kernel</title>
	<section>
		<title>Compiling USB support into the kernel</title>
		<body>
			<p>As you may know, there are two ways that kernel support for devices can be
			configured; either as modules, or statically compiled into the kernel. Modular
			design allows for a smaller kernel size, and quicker boot times. Statically compiled
			support allows for boot-time detection of devices as well as taking away the fuss
			of module dependencies. Both of these methods have their ups and downs, but I would
			suggest using modules initially because of their easy trouble-shooting nature.
			Later, when you get everything working, you may statically compile your device support
			for convienence.
			</p>

			<p>If you have not already, emerge your kernel sources of choice: </p>

			<pre caption="Emerging your kernel sources">
# <c>emerge -s sources</c>
<codenote>This will show a list of all our kernel sources</codenote>
# <c>emerge your-kernel-sources</c>
			</pre>

			<p>After that has completed, you will want to <c>cd</c> to your kernel source directory,
			and enter the ncurses-based GUI configuration: </p>

			<pre caption="Configuring your kernel for USB">
# <c>cd /usr/src/your-kernel-sources</c>
			</pre>

			<p>Before proceding to the next step, it is important to know what kind of USB controller
			your system uses. Using the <i>pciutils</i> package, this is a relatively trivial task. </p>

			<p>If you have not emerged <i>pciutils</i>, please do so now: </p>

			<pre caption="Emerging pciutils">
# <c>emerge pciutils</c>
			</pre>

			<p>After this is complete run <c>lspci</c>, and you should get an output that looks much like this: </p>

			<pre caption="lspci output">
# <c>lspci</c>

			</pre>

			<p>As you can see, <c>lspci</c> gives a complete listing of all PCI/ PCI Bus Masters that your computer
			uses. The lines that are highlighted should be similar to what you are looking for in your <c>lspci</c>
			readout. Since I am using a VIA controller, I will be using the UHCI USB driver. For other chipsets,
			you would pick from one of the choices listed below: </p>
			
			<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Driver</th>
				<th>Chipset</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<ti>EHCI</ti>
				<ti>USB 2.0 Support</ti>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<ti>UHCI</ti>
				<ti>All Intel , All VIA Chipsets</ti>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<ti>JE (Alternate to UHCI</ti>
				<ti>If UHCI does not work, and you have an Intel or VIA chipset, try JE. </ti>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<ti>OHCI</ti>
				<ti>Compaq, iMacs, OPTi, SiS, ALi</ti>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>After you have discovered what host controller your system uses, it is time to enable
			support for your USB system in your kernel. In your kernel configuration, you will want to
			locate the <i>USB Support</i> section, and procede from there. The options are rather straightforward,
			just remember to make everything a module, and to enable support for your host controller
			that you discovered above. </p>

			<pre caption="Kernel configuration">
# <c>make menuconfig</c>
			</pre>

			<p>After your kernel is finished compiling, install it and reboot as normal. </p>

		<title>Configuring a USB Mouse</title>
		<body>
			<p>Perhaps the most common USB device that most people use is a USB mouse. Not only is it easy to install,
			but it offers Plug and Play flexibility for laptop users like myself who would
			rather not use the homicide-inducing trackpad. </p>

			<p>As with most things, it is necessary to compile USB mouse support into the kernel in order
			to get the full affect of the USB mouse. There are two options that you should enable: </p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Menuconfig location</th>
					<th>Option</th>
					<th>Reason</th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<ti>Input Core Support</ti>
					<ti>Mouse Support <i>(Don't forget to input your screen resolution!)</i></ti>
					<ti>This will hone your mouse to your resolution, which makes tracking across
						large resolutions much nicer. </ti>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<ti>USB Support/ USB Human Interface Devices (HID)</ti>
					<ti>USB HIDPB Mouse (basic) Support</ti>
					<ti>Since your USB mouse is a USB HID device, this will enable support for that</ti>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>After all of these options are comiled into your kernel as modules, install your kernel
			and reboot. </p>

			<p>Once your new kernel is installed and you have rebooted, go ahead and plug in your USB mouse.
			If you already had the mouse plugged in while the machine is booting, no worries as it will
			still work alright, providing that you got all of the necessary items compiled into the kernel. </p>

			<p>Once you plug in the mouse, use <c>dmesg</c> to see if it was detected by the kernel:</p>

			<pre caption="Checking kernel messages">
# <c>dmesg</c>
<codenote>You will be looking for lines like the one below:</codenote>
hub.c: new USB device 10:19.0-1, assigned address 2
input4: USB HID v0.01 Mouse [Microsoft Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical] on usb2:2.0
			</pre>

			<p>Once you have confirmed that your mouse is recognized by the kernel, it is time to configure
			X to use it. </p>

			<p>If you already have X installed and running with a non-USB mouse, there is not much
			of a configuration change needed to use your USB mouse. The only item that will be changed
			is what device X uses for your mouse. For our purposes, we will be using the <path>/dev/input/mice</path>
			device since it supports hotplugging of your mouse, which can be very handy for desktop and laptop
			users alike. Your <i>XF86Config</i> Input Device section should look similar to the example here: </p>

			<pre caption="Example pointer section for XF86Config">
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier				"Mouse0"
	Driver					"mouse"
	Option  		"Protocol"      "IMPS/2"
	Option          	"ZAxisMapping"  "4 5"
	Option          	"Device"        "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection
			</pre>

			<p>Now, restart X, and your USB mouse should be working just fine. Since everything is working,
			I would go ahead and compile your USB modules into the kernel statically. Of course, this is completely
			optional, so if you would like to keep your modules as modules, don't forget to add the necessary modules
			to <path>/etc/modules.autoload</path> so that they are automatically loaded at boot time. </p>

			<pre caption="Adding entries to /etc/modules.autoload">
# <c>echo $'\n'mousedev $'\n'hid $'\n'usbcore $'\n'input >> /etc/modules.autoload</c>
			</pre>
