<abstract>This guide introduces you to the ultimate tool for
customizing Gentoo -- USE settings.   Not only is there a description of
each USE flag in current use, there is also a helpful guide to help you to
determine which USE flags you will need to use.</abstract>

<version>1.2.1</version>
<date>18 August 2003</date>

<title>Introduction</title>
<section>
<title>What is the use of <c>USE</c> flags anyway?</title>
<body>
<p>One of the things which attracted me, as a user, to Gentoo was the fact
that it is a highly customisable distribution.  The fact that it is a source
based distribution allows the user complete control over what kinds of
features and support are built in to the installed applications.  Moreover,
the idea of bloat reduction appealed to me -- I like not having to install
things which I do not <e>really</e> need.</p>

<p>And how, exactly, does Gentoo achieve this?  By defining <c>USE</c> settings.
Essentially, these are keywords that define options used on a system-wide
basis to configure applications during their respective compilation
procedures.</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Default <c>USE</c> flags</title>
<body>
<p>Of course, Gentoo defines a set of safe default flags for you.  You will
find these in your <path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path> file.</p>


<p>From the Gentoo-1.4_rc2 release, the <c>USE</c> settings are:</p>

<pre>USE="xv slang readline gpm berkdb mmx 3dnow gdbm tcpd pam libwww ssl nls
     arts perl python esd gif imlib sdl oggvorbis gnome gtk X qt
     kde motif opengl avi png tiff gif"</pre>


<warn>
Do not write to this file, as I can see many of you scrambling to do, but read 
the next section first.

<section>
<title>Setting your own USE flags</title>
<body>

<p>
To set you own use flags, edit your <path>/etc/make.conf</path> file. In that 
file, you will see:
</p>

<pre caption = "Commented USE-flag">
#USE=""
</pre>

<p>
Simply uncomment this line by removing the <c>#</c>, and add whatever other 
flags you want to add. "But what if I want to remove things from the 
<path>make.defaults</path> file?" I hear you ask.  That is simply done by 
putting "-flag" in the USE variable in your <path>/etc/make.conf</path> 
file.
</p> 

<impo>
Remember that <c>-flag</c> disables a flag and <c>flag</c> adds a flag.  If a 
flag is neither in <path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path> nor in 
<path>/etc/make.conf</path> then its functionality is disabled.
</impo>

<pre caption="Example USE Variable from /etc/make.conf">
USE="-gnome -kde qt -arts -nls python perl oggvorbis opengl sdl
     -postgres jpeg png truetype xml xml2 dvd avi aalib mpeg encode fbcon
     mmx"
</pre>

<p>
You do not have to edit your <path>/etc/make.conf</path> if you want to emerge 
a single package with different USE flags. You can simply set the <c>USE</c> 
environment variable. Its contents are added to what you already have in 
<path>make.defaults</path> and <path>make.conf</path>. However, this
"altered" USE flag isn't used when you update that package.
</p>

<pre caption="USE as Environment Variable">
# <i>USE="-guile +libgda" emerge -pv gnumeric</i>

These are the packages that I would merge, in order:
 
Calculating dependencies ...done!
[ebuild     U ] app-office/gnumeric-1.0.13-r1 [1.0.8] +libgda -gb -evo +python +bonobo -guile -perl

# <i>emerge -pv gnumeric</i>
 
These are the packages that I would merge, in order:
 
Calculating dependencies ...done!
[ebuild     U ] app-office/gnumeric-1.0.13-r1 [1.0.8] -libgda -gb -evo +python +bonobo +guile -perl
</pre>

<note>
As you can see <c>emerge -pv pkg</c> tells you which flags a certain package
uses and what flags are set.
</note>

<p>
Now that you know how to enable extra flags, and disable existing flags,
let us examine what these flags actually do.

<section>
<title>Where to find USE Flags</title>
<body>

<note>
If you want to add a use flag, add it to <path>use.desc</path> and upload it 
to CVS. <path>use.desc</path> is what this list is generated from. 
</note>

<p>
You can find an automagically updated database of USE flags here: 
<uri link="/dyn/use-index.xml">USE Flags</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<c>etcat</c> from the <c>gentoolkit</c> package will tell you which USE flags 
are available for a package, which USE flags are currently set, and which 
USE flags were set when the package was last emerged. It will also display a 
short description of these USE flags.
