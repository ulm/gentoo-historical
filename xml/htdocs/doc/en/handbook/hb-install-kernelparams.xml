<brite>Hardware options:</brite>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>acpi=on</dt>
<dd>
  This loads support for ACPI and also causes the acpid daemon to be started by
  the CD on boot. This is only needed if your system requires ACPI to function
  properly. This is not required for Hyperthreading support.
</dd>
<dt>acpi=off</dt>
<dd>
  Completely disables ACPI. This is useful on some older systems and is also a
  requirement for using APM. This will disable any Hyperthreading support of
  your processor.
</dd>
<dt>console=X</dt>
<dd>
  This sets up serial console access for the CD. The first option is the
  device, usually ttyS0 on x86, followed by any connection options, which are
  comma separated. The default options are 9600,8,n,1.
</dd>
<dt>dmraid=X</dt>
<dd>
  This allows for passing options to the device-mapper RAID subsystem. Options
  should be encapsulated in quotes.
</dd>
<dt>doapm</dt>
<dd>
  This loads APM driver support. This requires you to also use acpi=off.
</dd>
<dt>dopcmcia</dt>
<dd>
  This loads support for PCMCIA and Cardbus hardware and also causes the pcmcia
  cardmgr to be started by the CD on boot. This is only required when booting
  from PCMCIA/Cardbus devices.
</dd>
<dt>doscsi</dt>
<dd>
  This loads support for most SCSI controllers. This is also a requirement for
  booting most USB devices, as they use the SCSI subsystem of the kernel.
</dd>
<dt>sda=stroke</dt>
<dd>
  This allows you to partition the whole hard disk even when your BIOS is unable
  to handle large disks. This option is only used on machines with an older BIOS.
  Replace sda with the device that requires this option.
</dd>
<dt>ide=nodma</dt>
<dd>
  This forces the disabling of DMA in the kernel and is required by some IDE
  chipsets and also by some CDROM drives. If your system is having trouble
  reading from your IDE CDROM, try this option. This also disables the default
  hdparm settings from being executed.
</dd>
<dt>noapic</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller that is present
  on newer motherboards. It has been known to cause some problems on older
  hardware.
</dd>
<dt>nodetect</dt>
<dd>
  This disables all of the autodetection done by the CD, including device
  autodetection and DHCP probing. This is useful for doing debugging of a
  failing CD or driver.
</dd>
<dt>nodhcp</dt>
<dd>
  This disables DHCP probing on detected network cards. This is useful on
  networks with only static addresses.
</dd>
<dt>nodmraid</dt>
<dd>
  Disables support for device-mapper RAID, such as that used for on-board
  IDE/SATA RAID controllers.
</dd>
<dt>nofirewire</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the loading of Firewire modules. This should only be necessary
  if your Firewire hardware is causing a problem with booting the CD.
</dd>
<dt>nogpm</dt>
<dd>
  This disables gpm console mouse support.
</dd>
<dt>nohotplug</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the loading of the hotplug and coldplug init scripts at boot.
  This is useful for doing debugging of a failing CD or driver.
</dd>
<dt>nokeymap</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the keymap selection used to select non-US keyboard layouts.
</dd>
<dt>nolapic</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the local APIC on Uniprocessor kernels.
</dd>
<dt>nosata</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the loading of Serial ATA modules. This is used if your system
  is having problems with the SATA subsystem.
</dd>
<dt>nosmp</dt>
<dd>
  This disables SMP, or Symmetric Multiprocessing, on SMP-enabled kernels. This
  is useful for debugging SMP-related issues with certain drivers and
  motherboards.
</dd>
<dt>nosound</dt>
<dd>
  This disables sound support and volume setting. This is useful for systems
  where sound support causes problems.
</dd>
<dt>nousb</dt>
<dd>
  This disables the autoloading of USB modules. This is useful for debugging
  USB issues.
</dd>
<dt>slowusb</dt>
<dd>
  This adds some extra pauses into the boot process for slow USB CDROMs, like
  in the IBM BladeCenter.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<brite>Volume/Device Management:</brite>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>dolvm</dt>
<dd>
  This enables support for Linux's Logical Volume Management.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<brite>Other options:</brite>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>debug</dt>
<dd>
  Enables debugging code. This might get messy, as it displays a lot of data to
  the screen.
</dd>
<dt>docache</dt>
<dd>
  This caches the entire runtime portion of the CD into RAM, which allows you
  to umount /mnt/cdrom and mount another CDROM. This option requires that you
  have
  at least twice as much available RAM as the size of the CD.
</dd>
<dt>doload=X</dt>
<dd>
  This causes the initial ramdisk to load any module listed, as well as
  dependencies. Replace X with the module name.
<br/>
  Multiple modules can be specified by a comma-separated list.
</dd>
<dt>dosshd</dt>
<dd>
  Starts sshd on boot, which is useful for unattended installs.
</dd>
<dt>passwd=foo</dt>
<dd>
  Sets whatever follows the equals as the root password, which is required for
  dosshd since we scramble the root password.
</dd>
<dt>noload=X</dt>
<dd>
  This causes the initial ramdisk to skip the loading of a specific module that
  may be causing a problem. Syntax matches that of doload.
</dd>
<dt>nonfs</dt>
<dd>
  Disables the starting of portmap/nfsmount on boot.
</dd>
<dt>nox</dt>
<dd>
  This causes an X-enabled LiveCD to not automatically start X, but rather, to
  drop to the command line instead.
</dd>
<dt>scandelay</dt>
<dd>
  This causes the CD to pause for 10 seconds during certain portions the boot
  process to allow for devices that are slow to initialize to be ready for use.
</dd>
<dt>scandelay=X</dt>
<dd>
  This allows you to specify a given delay, in seconds, to be added to certain
  portions of the boot process to allow for devices that are slow to initialize
  to be ready for use. Replace X with the number of seconds to pause.
</dd>
