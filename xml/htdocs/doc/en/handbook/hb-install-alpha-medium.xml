<title>The Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Minimal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Minimal Installation CD</e> is a bootable CD which contains a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. It allows you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. The CD is maintained by Gentoo developers and allows you to install
Gentoo with an active Internet connection.
</p>

<p>
The Minimal Installation CD is called <c><keyval id="min-cd-name"/></c> and
takes up around <keyval id="min-cd-size"/> MB of diskspace.

<title>The Stage3 Tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
A stage3 tarball is an archive containing a minimal Gentoo environment, suitable
to continue the Gentoo installation using the instructions in this manual.
Previously, the Gentoo Handbook described the installation using one of three 
stage tarballs. While Gentoo still offers stage1 and stage2 tarballs, the 
official installation method uses the stage3 tarball. If you are interested in
performing a Gentoo installation using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, please read
the Gentoo FAQ on <uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ/#How_do_I_Install_Gentoo_Using_a_Stage1_or_Stage2_Tarball.3F">How
do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?</uri>
</p>

<p>
Stage3 tarballs can be downloaded from <path><keyval
id="release-dir"/>current-stage3/</path> on any of the <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">Official Gentoo Mirrors</uri> and are not provided
on the LiveCD.

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo Installation CD. We'll first start by 
downloading and burning the chosen Installation CD. We previously discussed 
the Installation CD, but where can you find it? 
</p>

<p>
You can download the Installation CD from one of our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CD is located in
the <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>current-iso/</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find the ISO file. This is a full CD image which you
can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can check
its SHA-2 checksum and compare it with the SHA-2 checksum we provide (such as
<path><keyval id="min-cd-name"/>.DIGESTS</path>). You can check the SHA-2 checksum
with the <c>sha512sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.sinf.gr/en/hashcalc.html">Checksums calculator</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<note>
The tool will attempt to verify the checksums in the list, even if the checksum
is made with a different algorithm. Therefore, the output of the command might
give both success (for SHA checksums) and failures (for other checksums). At
least one OK needs to be provided for each file.
</note>

<pre caption="Verifying the SHA-2 checksum">
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS&gt;</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you get the message that no properly formatted SHA checksum was found, take a
look at the DIGESTS file yourself to see what the supported checksums are.
</note>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public keys whose
key ids can be found on the <uri link="/proj/en/releng/index.xml">release
engineering project site</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
<comment>(... Substitute the key ids with those mentioned on the release engineering site ...)</comment>
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 96D8BF6D 2D182910 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the files">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_burn_an_ISO_file.3F">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 &lt;downloaded iso 
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/sr0</path> with your CD-RW drive's 
    device path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>Burn CD Image</c>. Then you can locate
    your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Booting the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
When your Alpha is powered on, the first thing that gets started is the
firmware. It is loosely synonymous with the BIOS software on PC systems. There
are two types of firmware on Alpha systems: SRM (<e>Systems Reference 
Manual</e>) and ARC (<e>Advanced Risc Console</e>).
</p>

<p>
SRM is based on the Alpha Console Subsystem specification, which provides an
operating environment for OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and Linux operating systems. ARC
is based on the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification, which provides
an operating environment for Windows NT.  You can find a 
<uri link="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/SRM-HOWTO/">detailed guide</uri> on 
using SRM over at the Alpha Linux website.
</p>

<p>
If your Alpha system supports both SRM and ARCs (ARC, AlphaBIOS, ARCSBIOS) you
should follow <uri link="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/x31.html">these
instructions</uri> for switching to SRM. If your system already uses SRM, you
are all set. If your system can only use ARCs (Ruffian, nautilus, xl, etc.) you
will need to choose <c>MILO</c> later on when we are talking about bootloaders.
</p>

<p>
Now to boot an Alpha Installation CD, put the CD-ROM in the tray and reboot the
system. You can use SRM to boot the Installation CD. If you cannot do that, you
will have to use <c>MILO</c>.
</p>

MILO&gt; <i>boot sdb:/boot/gentoo initrd=/boot/gentoo.igz root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc looptype=squashfs loop=/image.squashfs console=ttyS0 cdroot</i>
</pre>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1.
