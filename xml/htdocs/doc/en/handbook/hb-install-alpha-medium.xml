<title>The Gentoo Installation Approaches</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using one of three <e>stage</e> tarball files.
A stage file is a tarball (compressed archive) that contains a minimal
environment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
     A stage1 file contains nothing more than a compiler, Portage (Gentoo's
     software management system) and a couple of packages on which the compiler
     or Portage depends.
   </li>
   <li>
     A stage2 file contains a so-called bootstrapped system, a minimal
     environment from which one can start building all other necessary
     applications that make a Gentoo environment complete.
   </li>
   <li>
     A stage3 file contains a prebuilt minimal system which is almost fully
     deployable. It only lacks a few applications where you, the Gentoo user,
     needs to choose which one you want to install.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
To help you decide what stage file you want to use, we have written down the
major advantages and disadvantages of each stage file.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>A Stage1 Approach</title>
<body>

<p>
A <e>stage1</e> is used when you want to bootstrap and build the entire system 
from scratch.
</p>

<p>
Starting from a stage1 allows you to have total control over the
optimization settings and optional build-time functionality that is
initially enabled on your system. This makes <e>stage1</e> installs good for
power users who know what they are doing. It is also a great
installation method for those who would like to know more about the
inner workings of Gentoo Linux.
</p>

  <ti>
    If you don't intend to tweak the settings, it is a waste of time
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>A Stage2 Approach</title>
<body>

<p>
A <e>stage2</e> is used for building the entire system from a bootstrapped
"semi-compiled" state.
</p>

<p>
Stage2 installs allow you to skip the bootstrap process; doing this
is fine if you are happy with the optimization settings that we chose
for your particular stage2 tarball.
</p>

  <ti>You don't need to bootstrap</ti>

  <ti>You cannot tweak as much as with a stage1</ti>

  <ti>It's still not the fastest way to install Gentoo</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You have to accept the optimizations we chose for the bootstrap</ti>
</tr>
</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>A Stage3 Approach</title>
<body>

<p>
A <e>stage3</e> installation contains a basic Gentoo Linux system that has been
built for you. You will only need to build a few packages of which we can't
decide for you which one to choose.
</p>

<p>
Choosing to go with a stage3 allows for the fastest install of Gentoo
Linux, but also means that your base system will have the optimization
settings that we chose for you (which to be honest, are good settings
and were carefully chosen to enhance performance while maintaining
stability). Stage3 is also required if you want to install Gentoo using
prebuilt packages or without a network connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Stage3</th>
  <th>Pros and Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>Fastest way to get a Gentoo base system</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You cannot tweak the base system - it's built already</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
You might be interested to know that, if you decide to use different 
optimization settings after having installed Gentoo, you will be able to 
recompile your entire system with the new optimization settings.

<title>The Gentoo LiveCDs</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo LiveCDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All LiveCDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet. We currently provide
two LiveCDs which are equaly suitable to install Gentoo from, as long as you're
planning on performing an Internet-based installation using the latest version
of the available packages.
</p>

<p>
If you whish to install Gentoo without a working Internet connection, please use
the installation instructions described in the <uri
link="2004.3/index.xml">Gentoo 2004.3 Handbooks</uri>. This is currently not
supported for the Alpha architecture though.
</p>

<p>
For the Alpha architecture, we only provide a <e>Minimal</e> LiveCD, 
a small, no-nonsense, bootable CD which sole purpose is to boot the 
system, prepare the networking and continue with the Gentoo installation.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Minimal LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Minimal LiveCD is called <c>install-alpha-minimal-2004.3-r1.iso</c> and 
takes up only 54 MB of diskspace. You can use this LiveCD to install Gentoo,
but always with a working Internet connection only.
</p>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the LiveCDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo LiveCD. We'll first start by downloading and 
burning the chosen LiveCD. We previously discussed the several available 
LiveCDs, but where can you find them? 
</p>

<p>
You can download any of the LiveCDs (and, if you want to, a Packages CD as
well) from one of our <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The
LiveCDs are located in the <path>releases/alpha/2004.3/livecd</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find so-called ISO-files. Those are full CD images
which you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can
check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we provide (such as
<path>install-alpha-minimal-2004.3.iso.md5</path>). You can check the MD5 checksum
with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public key:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso 
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's 
    device path) followed by the path to the ISO file :)
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
When your Alpha is powered on, the first thing that gets started is the
firmware. It is loosely synonymous with the BIOS software on PC systems. There
are two types of firmware on Alpha systems: SRM (<e>Systems Reference 
Manual</e>) and ARC (<e>Advanced Risc Console</e>).
</p>

<p>
SRM is based on the Alpha Console Subsystem specification, which provides an
operating environment for OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and Linux operating systems. ARM
is based on the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification, which provides
an operating environment for Windows NT.  You can find a 
<uri link="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/SRM-HOWTO/">detailed guide</uri> on 
using SRM over at the Alpha Linux website.
</p>

<p>
If your Alpha system supports both SRC and ARCs (ARC, AlphaBIOS, ARCSBIOS) you
should follow <uri link="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/x31.html">these
instructions</uri> for switching to SRM. If your system already uses SRM, you
are all set. If your system can only use ARCs (Ruffian, nautilus, xl, etc.) you
will need to choose <c>MILO</c> later on when we are talking about bootloaders.
</p>

<p>
Now to boot an Alpha LiveCD, put the CD-ROM in the tray and reboot the system.
You can use SRM to boot the LiveCD. If you cannot do that, you will have to use
<c>MILO</c>. If you don't have <c>MILO</c> installed already, use one of the
precompiled <c>MILO</c> images available on <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/milo/">taviso's homepage</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Booting a CD-ROM using SRM">

</pre>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1.

<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
When the Live CD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware devices and
loads the appropriate kernel modules to support your hardware. In the
vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However, in some cases (the
SPARC LiveCDs don't even do autodetection), it may not auto-load the kernel 
modules you need. If the PCI auto-detection missed some of your system's 
hardware, you will have to load the appropriate kernel modules manually. 
</p>

<p>
In the next example we try to load the <c>8139too</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe 8139too</i>
</pre>

<subsection>
<title>Optional: Tweaking Hard Disk Performance</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are an advanced user, you might want to tweak the IDE hard disk
performance using <c>hdparm</c>. With the <c>-tT</c> options you can
test the performance of your disk (execute it several times to get a
more precise impression):
</p>

<pre caption="Testing disk performance">
# <i>hdparm -tT /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

<p>
To tweak, you can use any of the following examples (or experiment
yourself) which use <path>/dev/hda</path> as disk (substitute with your
disk):
</p>

<pre caption="Tweaking hard disk performance">
<comment>Activate DMA:</comment>                                       # <i>hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda</i>
<comment>Activate DMA + Safe Performance-enhancing Options:</comment>  # <i>hdparm -d 1 -A 1 -m 16 -u 1 -a 64 /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook (either from-CD or online) during the
installation, make sure you have created a user account (see <uri
link="#useraccounts">Optional: User Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to
go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>lynx</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>lynx /mnt/cdrom/docs/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD. You can view it using <c>lynx</c>
as well, but only after having completed the <e>Configuring your Network</e>
chapter (otherwise you won't be able to go on the Internet to view the
document):
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>lynx http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-alpha.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
