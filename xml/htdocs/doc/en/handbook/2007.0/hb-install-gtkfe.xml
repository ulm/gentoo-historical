<title>Welcome</title>
<subsection>
<title>Before you begin</title>
<body>

<p>
Once the Gentoo Linux Installer (GLI) has finished loading, you will be greeted
by the welcome screen. It provides a friendly introduction to the process of
installing Gentoo on your computer. Remember to read each option carefully.
There is detailed help available for each step of installation; just look to the
left of each screen. We recommend that you always read the help pages before
making your choices. Note that at any time during the installation process, you
can save your configuration progress in case you need to resume your
installation at a later time.
</p>

<p>
There are three types of installation modes available. Choose <c>Networkless</c>
to begin installing Gentoo Linux.
</p>

<note>
Selecting <c>Networkless</c> will make some later configuration options
unavailable.

<title>Partitioning</title>
<subsection>
<title>Preparing the disks</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to install Gentoo on your machine, you will need to prepare your
disks. The <e>Partitioning</e> screen will show you a list of detected disks and
allow you to specify the filesystems you would like to have on your
partitions. Clicking <c>Clear partitions</c> will erase all previous partitions on
your disk, so be careful with this option! It is also possible to resize
certain partition types.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to go with the <c>Recommended layout</c>, the installer will erase
any previous partitions on your disk and create three partitions: 100MB for
<path>/boot</path>, a <path>/swap</path> partition up to 512MB in size, and the
rest of the available space on the disk is used for <path>/</path>, the root
partition.
</p>

<warn>
As with any partitioning application, you should backup your system before
making changes to your partition table, as any possible bugs could cause data
loss. Any changes you make to your partition table will be performed by the
installer immediately.
</warn>

<section>
<title>Network Mounts</title>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Define network mounts</title>
<body>

<p>
This screen lets you set up and use any existing network mounts during and after
installation. Click <c>New</c> to begin configuration. At this time, only NFS is
supported.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>make.conf</title>
<subsection>
<title>USE flags</title>
<body>

<p>
Since you are performing a GRP/networkless install, you will not be allowed
to select USE flags before installation. However, you are free to set your own
USE flags in <path>/etc/make.conf</path> after you have rebooted into your
finished system.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>CFLAGS</title>
<body>

<p>
You should, however, select your processor type in the <e>CFLAGS</e> section along
with any custom optimizations you may want, such as <c>-O2</c> and
<c>-pipe</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Other</title>
<body>

<p>
Any other options you wish to set for future use should be selected now.
<e>Build binary packages</e> creates ready-to-install binary tarballs of all
packages you compile on your system. <e>DistCC</e> allows you to share the
burden of compiling with another computer via your network connection.
</p>

<p>
You will not be allowed to change your <e>CHOST</e>, as this can seriously damage
your installation. In <e>MAKEOPTS</e> you define how many parallel compilations
should occur when you install a package. A good choice is the number of CPUs
in your system plus one, but this guideline isn't always perfect. On a
uniprocessor system, <c>-j2</c> might be used.
</p>

<section>
<title>Timezone</title>
<subsection>
<title>Choose your timezone</title>
<body>

<p>
Study the map and select the region closest to your actual location. Later,
you will be asked to select if you want your clock to be set to UTC or local
time.
</p>

<section>
<title>Kernel Sources</title>
<subsection>
<title>Using the LiveCD kernel</title>
<body>

<p>
You must use the kernel present on the LiveCD for the GRP/networkless install.
This is merely a <c>gentoo-sources</c> kernel compiled by <c>genkernel</c>,
Gentoo's automated kernel compilation utility and will give you a kernel that
automatically detects and configures your hardware upon boot.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Networking</title>
<subsection>
<title>Device information</title>
<body>

<p>
On this screen, you will be able to configure the various network interface
devices on your computer. Read the available options carefully.
</p>

<p>
On the <e>Hostname/Proxy Information/Other</e> tab, you will need to choose a
hostname for your machine. You may also specify proxy server and DNS settings
if needed.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Daemons</title>
<subsection>
<title>Cron daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
Cron daemons are helpful programs that run tasks at scheduled times. While you
do not <e>need</e> to install one, they can be quite useful. Since this is a
Networkless installation, you are limited to <c>vixie-cron</c> or no cron
daemon.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>System logger</title>
<body>

<p>
A system logger is a necessity for any Linux operating system. Since this is a
Networkless installation, you are limited to <c>syslog-ng</c> or no logger.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
</section>


<section>
<title>Bootloader</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
This screen allows to you choose your bootloader and, optionally, specify
additional kernel parameters that will be used at bootup. Since this is a
Networkless installation, you are limited to <c>grub</c> or no bootloader. 
</p>

<p>
You may specify which disk to boot from by choosing the appropriate option
from <e>Boot Drive</e>. In Linux, the first IDE disk in your system is called
<c>hda</c>, the second IDE disk is <c>hdb</c>, and so on. If you have SATA or
SCSI disks, they will be called <c>sda</c>, <c>sdb</c>, etc. Please make the
correct selection for your system.
</p>
<!-- more bootloader inclusions needed about vga, etc. just don't include pure
CLI stuff, but only what can go on the extra kernel params line -->
<p>
If you need to pass any additional options to the kernel, such as video and/or
VGA statements, simply add them to the "Extra kernel parameters" section.
</p>

<p>
If you jumpered your harddrive because the BIOS can't handle large harddrives
you'll need to append <c>hdx=stroke</c>. If you have SCSI devices, you should
add <c>doscsi</c> as a kernel option.
</p>

<!-- do we need to cover all the stuff about lilo/grub and kernel parameter
lines and/or block devices here? -->

</body>

<section>
<title>Users</title>
<subsection>
<title>Adding users and groups</title>
<body>

<p>
First set the root password for the system administrator (the <e>root</e>
user).
</p>

<p>
We <e>strongly</e> recommend that you create a regular user for daily work.
Working as root all the time is <e>dangerous</e> and should be avoided! Create
your users, add them to the appropriate groups, and set their passwords. You
can optionally change their home directories, select their login shell, and
set helpful comments.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<section>
<title>Extra Packages</title>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: installing extra packages</title>
<body>

<p>
The LiveCD contains a number of available pre-built packages. If you wish to
install any of them, check the appropriate box.

<section>
<title>Startup Services</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
This screen allows you to choose various services to load at system boot.
Study the available options and their descriptions carefully, and then select
your desired services. For example, if you have chosen to install
<c>xorg-x11</c> and want to boot straight into a graphical desktop, then you
would select "xdm" from the list.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Other Settings</title>
<subsection>
<title>Miscellaneous options</title>
<body>

<p>
Now you will be able to change various settings, including keyboard layout,
graphical display manager, the default editor, and whether to set your
hardware clock to UTC or local time.

<title>Finishing Up</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
At this point, you're done. You can reboot into your new Gentoo system at any
time.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations, your system is now fully equipped! Continue with <uri
link="?part=1&amp;chap=5">Where to go from here?</uri> to learn more about
Gentoo.
