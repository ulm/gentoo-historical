<title>Welcome</title>
<subsection>
<title>Before you begin</title>
<body>

<p>
After you boot the Gentoo Linux Installer LiveCD, it will attempt to load a
graphical desktop. If it is unable to do so, it will instead display a command
line prompt. To launch the installer, simply type:
</p>

<pre caption="Start the installer">
# <i>installer-dialog</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once the installer has finished loading, you will be greeted by the welcome
screen. It provides a friendly introduction to the process of installing Gentoo
on your computer. Remember to read each option carefully. There is detailed
help available for each step of installation at the top of the screen.  We
recommend that you always read the help provided before making your choices.
Note that at any time during the installation process, you can save your
configuration progress in case you need to resume your installation at a later
time. Use the <c>Tab</c> key (on your keyboard) to move around the menus within
a screen and the <c>Enter</c> key to confirm an action.
</p>

<p>
There are two types of installation modes available, <c>Standard</c> and
<c>Advanced</c>. The first mode will set a number of options without requiring
your intervention, while the second mode will require you to make several more
choices during installation.
</p>

<p>
If you choose <c>Standard</c>, skip ahead to <uri
link="#partitioning">Partitioning</uri>. Otherwise, continue reading.

<title>Manual Network Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Even though you will be installing without a connection to the internet, you
can manually set up connections to your local area network (LAN), in case you
want to install Gentoo from another machine on your LAN.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to enable SSH access to the machine (for remote installation), you
can start <c>sshd</c> and specify a root password.
</p>

<p>
If you need to load more kernel modules to support your hardware, enter their
names, each separated by a space.

<title>Partitioning</title>
<subsection>
<title>Preparing the disks</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to install Gentoo on your machine, you will need to prepare your
disks. The <c>Partitioning</c> screen will show you a list of detected disks and
allow you to specify the filesystems you would like to have on your
partitions. Selecting <c>Clear partitions</c> will erase all previous partitions on
your disk, so be careful with this option!<!-- It is also possible to resize
certain partition types. -->
</p>

<p>
If you choose to go with the <c>Recommended layout</c>, the installer will
create three partitions: 100MB for <path>/boot</path>, a <path>/swap</path>
partition up to 512MB in size, and the rest of the available space on the disk
is used for <path>/</path>, the root partition.
</p>

<warn>
As with any partitioning application, you should backup your system before
making changes to your partition table, as any possible bugs could cause data
loss.
</warn>

<title>System Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<title>Installation type</title>
<body>

<p>
Since you are performing a GRP/networkless install, you must select
<c>Networkless</c>, then continue with the installation.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Timezone</title>
<body>

<p>
Study the list and select the region closest to your actual location.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Networking</title>
<body>

<p>
On this screen, you will be able to configure the various network interface
devices detected on your computer. Read the available options carefully.
</p>

<p>
The next screen gives you a choice between DHCP and manual IP address
configuration. Once your network interface is properly configured, you will
need to create a hostname for your system. Optionally, you may specify a
domainname and any DNS server information needed.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Bootloader</title>
<body>

<p>
This screen allows to you choose your bootloader (<c>grub</c>, or no
bootloader). Next, select your boot device and (optionally) specify any
additional boot options.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Users and groups</title>
<body>

<p>
First set the root password for the system administrator (the <e>root</e>
user).
</p>

<p>
We <e>strongly</e> recommend that you create a regular user for daily work.
Working as root all the time is <e>dangerous</e> and should be avoided! Create
your users, set their passwords, and add them to the appropriate groups. You can
optionally change their home directories and select their login shell.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Extra Packages</title>
<body>

<p>
The LiveCD contains a number of available pre-built packages. If you wish to
install any of them, check the appropriate box.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Startup Services</title>
<body>

<p>
This screen allows you to choose various services to load at system boot. Study
the available options and their descriptions carefully, and then select your
desired services. For example, if you have chosen to install <c>xorg-x11</c>
and want to boot straight into a graphical desktop, then you would select
"xdm" from the list.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Other Settings</title>
<body>

<p>
If you chose to perform an <c>Advanced</c> installation, you now will be able to
change various settings, including keyboard layout, graphical display manager,
the default editor, and whether to set your hardware clock to UTC or local
time.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Finishing Up</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
The installer will ask if you want to save your <c>installation profile</c> for
later use. The installer will alert you when it has finished. It will then
return you to the command prompt. All you need to do to reboot is type:
</p>

<pre caption="Rebooting">
# <i>shutdown -r now</i>
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, your system is now fully equipped! Continue with <uri

Gentoo.
