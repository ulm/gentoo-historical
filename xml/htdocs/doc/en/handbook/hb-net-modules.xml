<title>Network Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
We now support modular networking scripts, which means we can easily add support
for new interface types and configuration modules while keeping compatibility
with existing ones.
</p>

<p>
Modules load by default if the package they need is installed.  If you specify a
module here that doesn't have its package installed then you get an error
stating which package you need to install. Ideally, you only use the modules
setting when you have two or more packages installed that supply the same
service and you need to prefer one over the other.
</p>

<pre caption="Module preference">
<comment># Prefer iproute2 over ifconfig</comment>
modules=( "iproute2" )

<comment># You can also specify other modules for an interface
# In this case we prefer udhcpc over dhcpcd</comment>
modules_eth0=( "udhcpc" )

<comment># You can also specify which modules not to use - for example you may be
# using a supplicant or linux-wlan-ng to control wireless configuration but
# you still want to configure network settings per ESSID associated with.</comment>
modules=( "!iwconfig" )
</pre>

<title>Interface Handlers</title>
<body>

<p>
We provide two interface handlers presently: <c>ifconfig</c> and
<c>iproute2</c>. You need one of these to do any kind of network configuration.
</p>

<p>
<c>ifconfig</c> is the current Gentoo default and it's included in the system
profile. <c>iproute2</c> is a more powerful and flexible package, but it's not
included by default.
</p>

<pre caption="To install iproute2">
# <i>emerge sys-apps/iproute2</i>

<comment># To prefer iproute2 over ifconfig if both are installed</comment>
modules=( "iproute2" )
</pre>

<p>
As both <c>ifconfig</c> and <c>iproute2</c> do very similar things we allow
their basic configuration to work with each other. For example both the below
code snippet work regardless of which module you are using.
</p>

<pre caption="ifconfig and iproute2 examples">
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2/24" )
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0" )

<comment># We can also specify broadcast</comment>
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2/24 brd 192.168.0.255" )
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255" )

<title>DHCP</title>
<body>

<p>
DHCP is a means of obtaining network information (IP address, DNS servers,
Gateway, etc) from a DHCP server. This means that if there is a DHCP server
running on the network, you just have to tell each client to use DHCP and it
sets up the network all by itself. Of course, you will have to configure for
other things like wireless, PPP or other things if required before you can use
DHCP.
</p>

<p>
DHCP can be provided by <c>dhclient</c>, <c>dhcpcd</c>, <c>pump</c> or
<c>udhcpc</c>. Each DHCP module has its pros and cons - here's a quick run down.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>DHCP Module</th>
  <th>Package</th>
  <th>Pros</th>
  <th>Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>dhclient</c></ti>
  <ti><c>net-misc/dhcp</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Made by ISC, the same people who make the BIND DNS software. Very 
    configurable
  </ti>
  <ti>
    Configuration is overly complex, software is quite bloated, cannot get 
    NTP servers from DHCP, does not send hostname by default
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>dhcpcd</c></ti>
  <ti><c>net-misc/dhcpcd</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Long time Gentoo default, no reliance on outside tools
  </ti>
  <ti>
    No longer maintained upstream, can be slow at times, does not daemonize 
    when lease is infinite
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>pump</c></ti>
  <ti><c>net-misc/pump</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Lightweight, no reliance on outside tools
  </ti>
  <ti>
    No longer maintained upstream, unreliable, especially over modems, cannot
    get NIS servers from DHCP
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>udhcpc</c></ti>
  <ti><c>net-misc/udhcp</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Lightweight - smallest DHCP client around, made for embedded systems
  </ti>
  <ti>
    Unproven - no distro uses it by default, cannot define a timeout beyond 3 
    seconds
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>
     
<p>
If you have more than one DHCP client installed, you need to specify which one
to use - otherwise we default to <c>dhcpcd</c> if available.
</p>

<p>
To send specific options to the DHCP module, use <c>module_eth0="..."</c>
<e>(change module to the DHCP module you're using - ie <c>dhcpcd_eth0</c>)</e>.
</p>

<p>
We try and make DHCP relatively agnostic - as such we support the following
commands using the <c>dhcp_eth0</c> variable. The default is not to set any of
them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><c>release</c> - releases the IP address for re-use</li>
  <li><c>nodns</c> - don't overwrite <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path></li>
  <li><c>nontp</c> - don't overwrite <path>/etc/ntp.conf</path></li>
  <li><c>nonis</c> - don't overwrite <path>/etc/yp.conf</path></li>
</ul>

<pre caption="Sample DHCP configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Only needed if you have more than one DHCP module installed</comment>
modules=( "dhcpcd" ) 

config_eth0=( "dhcp" )
dhcpcd_eth0="-t 10" <comment># Timeout after 10 seconds</comment>
dhcp_eth0="release nodns nontp nonis" <comment># Only get an address</comment>
</pre>

<note>
<c>dhcpcd</c>, <c>udhcpc</c> and <c>pump</c> send the current hostname to the
DHCP server by default so you don't need to specify this anymore.

<title>ADSL Modem</title>
<body>

<p>
First we need to install the ADSL software.
</p>

<pre caption="Install the rp-pppoe package">
# <i>emerge net-dialup/rp-pppoe</i>
</pre>

<warn>
<c>baselayout-1.11.x</c> supports PPPoE only. Hopefully future versions will
support PPPoA.
</warn>

<p>
Now we need to configure <c>eth0</c> to be an ADSL interface and enter our 
username by updating <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="Configure eth0 for ADSL in /etc/conf.d/net">
config_eth0=( "adsl" )
adsl_user_eth0="username"
</pre>

<p>
Finally you need to define your username and password in
<path>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="sample /etc/ppp/pap-secrets">
<comment># The * is important</comment>
"username"  *  "password"
</pre>

<section id="apipa">
<title>APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)</title>
<body>

<p>
APIPA tries to find a free address in the range 169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255 by
arping a random address in that range on the interface. If no reply is found
then we assign that address to the interface.
</p>

<p>
This is only useful for LANs where there is no DHCP server and you don't connect
directly to the internet and all other computers use APIPA.
</p>

<p>
For APIPA support, emerge <c>net-misc/iputils</c> or <c>net-analyzer/arping</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="APIPA configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Try DHCP first - if that fails then fallback to APIPA</comment>
config_eth0=( "dhcp" )
fallback_eth0=( "apipa" )

<comment># Just use APIPA</comment>
config_eth0=( "apipa" )

<title>Bonding</title>
<body>

<p>
For link bonding/trunking emerge <c>net-misc/ifenslave</c>.
</p>

<p>
Bonding is used to increase network bandwidth. If you have two network cards
going to the same network, you can bond them together so your applications see
just one interface but they really use both network cards.
</p>

<pre caption="bonding configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># To bond interfaces together</comment>
slaves_bond0="eth0 eth1 eth2"

<comment># You may not want to assign an IP to the bonded interface</comment>
config_bond0=( "null" )

<comment># Depend on eth0, eth1 and eth2 as they may require extra configuration</comment>
depend_bond0() {
  need net.eth0 net.eth1 net.eth2
}

<section>
<title>Bridging (802.1d support)</title>
<body>

<p>
For bridging support emerge <c>net-misc/bridge-utils</c>.
</p>

<p>
Bridging is used to join networks together. For example, you may have a server
that connects to the internet via an ADSL modem and a wireless access card to
enable other computers to connect to the internet via the ADSL modem. You could
create a bridge to join the two interfaces together.
</p>

<pre caption="Bridge configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Configure the bridge - "man btctl" for more details</comment>
brctl_br0=( "setfd 0" "sethello 0" "stp off" )

<comment># To add ports to bridge br0</comment>
bridge_br0="eth0 eth1"

<comment># You need to configure the ports to null values so dhcp does not get started</comment>
config_eth0=( "null" )
config_eth1=( "null" )

<comment># Finally give the bridge an address - you could use DHCP as well</comment>
config_br0=( "192.168.0.1/24" )

<comment># Depend on eth0 and eth1 as they may require extra configuration</comment>
depend_br0() {
  need net.eth0 net.eth1
}
</pre>

<impo>
For using some bridge setups, you may need to consult the <uri

<section>
<title>MAC Address</title>
<body>

<p>
You don't need to emerge anything for changing the MAC address of your
interface if you have <c>sys-apps/baselayout-1.11.14</c> or newer and want to
change to a specific MAC address. However, if you need to change to a random MAC
address or have a baselayout older than the version mentioned above, you have
to emerge <c>net-analyzer/macchanger</c> to be able to make use of this feature.
</p>

<pre caption="MAC Address change example">
<comment># To set the MAC address of the interface</comment>
mac_eth0="00:11:22:33:44:55"

<comment># To randomize the last 3 bytes only</comment>
mac_eth0="random-ending"

<comment># To randomize between the same physical type of connection (eg fibre,
# copper, wireless) , all vendors</comment>

<title>Tunnelling</title>
<body>

<p>
You don't need to emerge anything for tunnelling as the interface handler can do
it for you.
</p>

<pre caption="Tunnelling configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># For GRE tunnels</comment>
iptunnel_vpn0="mode gre remote 207.170.82.1 key 0xffffffff ttl 255"

<title>VLAN (802.1q support)</title>
<body>

<p>
For VLAN support, emerge <c>net-misc/vconfig</c>.
</p>

<p>
Virtual LAN is a group of network devices that behave as if they were connected
to a single network segment - even though they may not be. VLAN members can only
see members of the same VLAN even though they may share the same physical
network.
