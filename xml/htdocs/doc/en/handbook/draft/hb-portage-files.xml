<title>Portage Files</title>
<subsection>
<title>Configuration Directives</title>
<body>

<p>
Portage comes with a default configuration stored in
<path>/etc/make.globals</path>. When you take a look at it, you'll notice that
all Portage configuration is handled through variables. What variables Portage
listens to and what they mean are described later.
</p>

<p>
Since many configuration directives differ between architectures, Portage also
has a default configuration file inside your profile:
<path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path>. We'll explain more about profiles
and the <path>/etc/make.profile</path> directory later on.
</p>

<p>
If you're planning on changing a configuration variable, <e>don't</e> alter
<path>/etc/make.globals</path> or <path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path>. 
Instead use <path>/etc/make.conf</path> which has precedence over
the previous files. You'll also find a <path>/etc/make.conf.example</path>. As 
the name implies, this is merely an example file - Portage does not read in 
this file.
</p>

<p>
You can also define a Portage configuration variable as an environment variable,
but we don't recommend this.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Profile-Specific Information</title>
<body>

<p>
We've already encountered the <path>/etc/make.profile</path> directory. Well, 
this isn't exactly a directory but a symbolic link to a profile inside
<path>/usr/portage/profiles</path>. The profile this symlink points to is the
profile to which your system adheres.
</p>

<p>
A profile contains architecture-specific information for Portage, such as a list
of core packages, packages that don't work or are masked-out by Gentoo
developers.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>User-Specific Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
When you need to override Portage' behaviour regarding the installation of
software, you will end up editing files within <path>/etc/portage</path>. You
are <e>highly recommended</e> to use files within <path>/etc/portage</path> and
<e>highly discouraged</e> to override the behaviour through environment
variables!
</p>

<p>
Within <path>/etc/portage</path> you can create the following files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <path>package.mask</path> which lists the packages you never want Portage to
    install
  </li>
  <li>
    <path>package.unmask</path> which lists the packages you want to be able to
    install even though the Gentoo developers highly discourage you from
    emerging them
  </li>
  <li>
    <path>package.keywords</path> which lists the packages you want to be able
    to install even though the package hasn't been found suitable for your 
    system or architecture (yet)
  </li>
  <li>
    <path>package.use</path> which lists the USE flags you want to use for
    certain packages without having the entire system use those USE flags
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
More information about the <path>/etc/portage</path> directory and a full list
of possible files you can create can be found in the portage manpage:

<subsection>
<title>Changing Portage File &amp; Directory Locations</title>
<body>

<p>
The previously mentioned configuration files cannot be stored elsewhere -
Portage will always look for those configuration files at those exact locations.
However, Portage uses many other locations for various purposes: build
directory, source code storage, Portage tree location, ...
</p>

<p>
All these purposes have well-known default locations but can be altered to your
own taste through <path>/etc/make.conf</path>. The rest of this chapter explains
what special-purpose locations Portage uses and how to alter their placement on
your filesystem.
</p>

<p>
This document isn't meant to be used as a reference though. If you need 100%
coverage, please consult the portage and <path>make.conf</path> manpages:
</p>

<title>Storing Files</title>
<subsection>
<title>The Portage Tree</title>
<body>

<p>
The Portage tree default location is <path>/usr/portage</path>. This is defined
by the PORTDIR variable. When you store the Portage tree elsewhere (by altering
this variable), don't forget to change the <path>/etc/make.profile</path>
symbolic link accordingly.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Prebuilt Binaries</title>
<body>

<p>
Even though Portage doesn't use prebuilt binaries by default, it has extensive
support for them. When you ask Portage to work with prebuilt packages, it will
look for them in <path>/usr/portage/packages</path>. This location is defined by
the PKGDIR variable. 
</p>

<p>
The PKGDIR variable defaults to ${PORTDIR}/packages which means that, if you
alter the PORTDIR variable, the prebuilt binaries location is changed with it.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Source Code</title>
<body>

<p>
Application source code is stored in <path>/usr/portage/distfiles</path> by
default. This location is defined by the DISTDIR variable.
</p>

<p>
The DISTDIR variable defaults to ${PORTDIR}/distfiles which means that, if you
alter the PORTDIR variable, the source code location is changed with it.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>RPM Files</title>
<body>

<p>
Since some applications only come bundled as an RPM archive, Portage is able to
use the RPM format to extract and install packages. The default location where
Portage stores RPM files is <path>/usr/portage/rpm</path> and is defined by the
RPMDIR variable.
</p>

<p>
The RPMDIR variable defaults to ${PORTDIR}/rpm which means that, if you alter
the PORTDIR variable, the source code location is changed with it.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Building Software</title>
<subsection>
<title>Temporary Portage Files</title>
<body>

<p>
Portage' temporary files are stored in <path>/var/tmp</path> by default. This is
defined by the PORTAGE_TMPDIR variable.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Building Directory</title>
<body>

<p>
Portage creates specific build directories for each package it emerges inside
<path>/var/tmp/portage</path>. This location is defined by the BUILD_PREFIX
variable.
</p>

<p>
The BUILD_PREFIX variable defaults to ${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage which means
that, when you alter the PORTAGE_TMPDIR variable, the BUILD_PREFIX location
changes with it.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Extracting Prebuilt Packages</title>
<body>

<p>
Before Portage merges the contents of a prebuilt package to your life
filesystem, it extracts the package inside <brite>??</brite> first. 
This is defined by the PKG_TMPDIR variable.
</p>

<p>
The PKG_TMPDIR variable defaults to <brite>??</brite> which means that, 
when you alter the PORTAGE_TMPDIR variable, the PKG_TMPDIR location changes 
with it.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Live Filesystem Location</title>
<body>

<p>
By default Portage installs all files on your life filesystem (<path>/</path>).
This is defined by the ROOT variable and should <e>only</e> be used as an
environment variable for creating new build images.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<section>
<title>Logging Features</title>
<subsection>
<title>Ebuild Logging</title>
<body>

<p>
Portage can create per-ebuild logfiles, but only when the PORT_LOGDIR variable
is set to a location that is writable by Portage (the portage user). By default
this variable is unset.
</p>
