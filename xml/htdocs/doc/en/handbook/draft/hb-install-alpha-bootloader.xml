<title>Making your Choice</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured and compiled and the necessary system
configuration files are filled in correctly, it is time to install a
program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Such a
program is called a <e>bootloader</e>. 
</p>

<p>
Several bootloaders exist for Linux/Alpha. You must choose one of the supported
bootloaders, not all. You have the choice between <uri link="#aboot">aBoot</uri>
and <uri link="#milo">MILO</uri>.
</p>

<title>Default: Using aboot</title>
<body>

<p>
We first install aboot on our system. Of course we use <c>emerge</c> to
do so:
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing aboot">
# <i>emerge --usepkg aboot</i>
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to make our bootdisk bootable. This will start
<c>aboot</c> when you boot your system. We make our bootdisk bootable by
writing the <c>aboot</c> bootloader to the start of the disk.
</p>

<pre caption = "Making your bootdisk bootable">
# <i>swriteboot -f3 /dev/sda /boot/bootlx</i> 
# <i>abootconf /dev/sda 2</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you use a different partitioning scheme than the one we use
throughout this chapter, you have to change the commands accordingly.
Please read the appropriate manual pages (<c>man 8 swriteboot</c> and
<c>man 8 abootconf</c>).
</note>

<p>
Additionally, you can make Gentoo boot more easily by setting up the
aboot configuration file and SRM boot_osflags variable. You will need to
make sure that the bootdef_dev is also properly set (easier to do at the
console than from Linux).
</p>

<pre caption = "Improve booting Gentoo">
# <i>echo '0:2/boot/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda2' &gt; /etc/aboot.conf</i>
# <i>echo -n 0 &gt; /proc/srm_environment/named_variables/boot_osflags</i>
# <i>echo -n '' &gt; /proc/srm_environment/named_variables/boot_file</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you're installing using a serial console, don't forget to include
the serial console boot flag in <path>aboot.conf</path>. See 
<path>/etc/aboot.conf.example</path> for some further information. 
</p>

<p>
Aboot is now configured and ready to use. Continue with <uri
link="?part=1&amp;chap=10">Installing Necessary System Tools</uri>.

<title>Alternative: Using MILO</title>
<body>

<p>
Before continuing, you should decide on how to use MILO. In this
section, we will assume that you want to make a MILO boot floppy. If you
are going to boot from an MS-DOS partition on your hard disk, you should
amend the commands appropriately.
</p>

<p>
To install MILO, we use <c>emerge</c>.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing MILO">
# <i>emerge --usepkg milo</i>
</pre>

<p>
After MILO has been installed, the MILO images should be in
<path>/opt/milo</path>. The commands below make a bootfloppy for use
with MILO. Remember to use the correct image for your Alpha-system.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing MILO on a floppy">
<comment>(First insert a blank floppy)</comment>
# <i>fdformat /dev/fd0</i>
# <i>mformat a:</i>
# <i>mcopy /opt/milo/milo-2.2-18-gentoo-ruffian a:\milo</i>
# <i>mcopy /opt/milo/linload.exe a:\lilnload.exe</i>
<comment>(Only if you have a Ruffian:</comment>     
  # <i>mcopy /opt/milo/ldmilo.exe a:\ldmilo.exe</i>
<comment>)</comment>
# <i>echo -ne '\125\252' | dd of=/dev/fd0 bs=1 seek=510 count=2</i>
</pre>

<p>
Your MILO boot floppy is now ready to boot Gentoo Linux. You may need to
set environment variables in your ARCS Firmware to get MILO to start;
this is all explained in the <uri
link="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MILO-HOWTO/">MILO-HOWTO</uri> with some examples 
on common systems, and examples of the commands to use in interactive mode.
</p>

<p>
Not reading the <uri link="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MILO-HOWTO/">MILO-HOWTO</uri> 
is a <e>bad</e> idea.
