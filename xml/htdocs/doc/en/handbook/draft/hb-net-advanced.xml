<title>Advanced Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The config_eth0 variable is the heart of an interface's configuration.
It's a high level instruction list for configuring the interface (eth0 in
this case). Each command in the instruction list is performed sequentially.
The interface is deemed OK if at least one command works.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list of in-built instructions.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>null</ti>
    <ti>Do nothing</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>noop</ti>
    <ti>
      If the interface is up and there is an address then abort configuration
      successfully
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>an IPv4 or IPv6 address</ti>
    <ti>Add the address to the interface</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>
      dhcp, adsl or apipa<br/>
      (or a custom command from a 3rd party module)
    </ti>
    <ti>
      Run the module which provides the command. For example "dhcp" will
      run a module that provides dhcp which can be one of either dhcpcd,
      udhcpc, dhclient or pump.
    </ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
If a command fails, you can specify a fallback command. The fallback has to
match the config structure exactly.
</p>

<p>
You can chain these commands together. Here are some real world some examples.
</p>

<pre caption="config examples">
<comment># Adding three IPv4 addresses</comment>
config_eth0=(
	"192.168.0.2/24"
	"192.168.0.3/24"
	"192.168.0.4/24"
)

<comment># Adding an IPv4 address and two IPv6 addresses</comment>
config_eth0=(
	"192.168.0.2/24"
	"4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab"
	"4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ac"
)

<comment># Keep our kernel assigned address, unless the interface goes
# down so assign another via DHCP. If DHCP fails then add a
# static address determined by APIPA</comment>
config_eth0=(
	"noop"
	"dhcp"
)
fallback_eth0=(
	"null"
	"apipa"
)
</pre>

<note>
When using the ifconfig module and adding more than one address, interface
aliases are created for each extra address. So with the above two examples you
will get interfaces eth0, eth0:1 and eth0:2.
You cannot do anything special with these interfaces as the kernel and other
programs will just treat eth0:1 and eth0:2 as eth0
</note>

<impo>
The fallback order is important! If we did not specify the "null" option then
the "apipa" command would only be run if the "noop" command failed.
</impo>

<title>Network Dependencies</title>
<body>

<p>Init scripts in <path>/etc/init.d</path> can depend on a specific network
interface or just net. "net" can be defined in <path>/etc/conf.d/rc</path> to
mean different things using the <c>RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING</c> variable.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>none</ti>
    <ti>The net service is always considered up</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>no</ti>
    <ti>
      This basically means that at least one net.* service besides net.lo
      must be up.  This can be used by notebook users that have a wifi and
      a static nic, and only wants one up at any given time to have the
      net service seen as up.
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>lo</ti>
    <ti>
      This is the same as the 'no' option, but net.lo is also counted.
      This should be useful to people that do not care about any specific
      interface being up at boot.
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>yes</ti>
    <ti>
      For this ALL network interfaces MUST be up for the 'net' service to
      be considered up.
    </ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
But what about net.br0 depending on net.eth0 and net.eth1?
net.eth1 may be a wireless or ppp device that needs configuration before it
can be added to the bridge.
This cannot be done in <path>/etc/init.d/net.br0</path> as that's a symbolic
link to net.lo
</p>

<p>
The answer is making your own depend() function in <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path>
</p>

<pre caption="net.br0 dependency in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># You can use any dependency (use, after, before) as found in current scripts</comment>
depend_br0() {
	need net.eth0 net.eth1
}
</pre>
