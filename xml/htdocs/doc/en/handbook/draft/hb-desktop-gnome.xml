<p>
GNOME is a desktop environment and a development platform. This piece of free
software is the desktop of choice for several industry leaders. It is
interesting both for business users, home users as well as developers.

<title>Installing GNOME</title>
<subsection>
<title>What do you need?</title>
<body>

<p>
Before you start installing GNOME, you might want to edit your USE variables.
Make sure that <c>gtk</c> and <c>gnome</c> are in your USE variable listed in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>. If you don't want KDE support (the other big
desktop environment), remove <c>qt</c> and <c>kde</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Example USE in /etc/make.conf">
USE="-qt -kde gtk gnome"
</pre>

<p>
Once done, start installing GNOME by emerging <c>gnome</c> and
<c>xscreensaver</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing GNOME">
# <i>emerge gnome xscreensaver</i>
</pre>

<p>
This will take a while, so you might want to start reading all those books your
mother bought you but you never opened. Done? Great, then we just need to update
our environment variables and we're all set.
</p>

<pre caption="Updating environment variables">
# <i>env-update &amp;&amp; source /etc/profile</i>
</pre>

<title>First Impressions</title>
<body>

<p>
Let us first take a look at what we just built. Exit your root shell and log on
as a regular user. We will configure our session to run GNOME when we issue the
<c>startx</c> command:
</p>

<pre caption="Having GNOME as default desktop environment">
$ <i>echo "exec gnome-session" &gt; ~/.xinitrc</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now start your graphical environment by running <c>startx</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting GNOME">
$ <i>startx</i>
</pre>

<p>
If all goes well, you should be greeted by GNOME. Congratulations. Now let us
take a look at how you can configure GNOME to suit your needs.
