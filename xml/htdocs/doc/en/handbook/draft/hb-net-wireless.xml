<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Currently we support wireless setup either by wireless-tools or
wpa_supplicant. The important thing to remember is that you configure for
wireless networks on a global basis and not an interface basis.
</p>

<p>
wpa_suppliant is the best choice, but it does not support all cards/drivers
and currently cannot connect to un-encypted Access Points. For a list of
supported drivers, <uri link="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/">read
the wpa_supplicant site</uri>.
</p>

<p>
wireless-tools supports nearly all cards and drivers, but it cannot connect
to WPA only Access Points.
</p>

<warn>
The linux-wlan-ng driver is not supported by baselayout at this time.
This is because linux-wlan-ng have their own setup and configuration
which is completely different to everyone else's. The linux-wlan-ng devs
are rumoured to be changing their setup over to wireless-tools - when this
happens you may use linux-wlan-ng with baselayout.

<title>WPA Supplicant</title>
<body>
<p>
<uri link="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant">WPA Supplicant</uri> is
a package that allows you to connect to WPA enabled access points. It's setup
is fairly fluid as it is still in beta - however it works fine for the most
part.
</p>

<pre caption="Install wpa_supplicant">
# <i>emerge net-wireless/wpa_supplicant</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we have to configure <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path> to so that we prefer
wpa_supplicant over wireless-tools (if both are installed, wireless-tools
is the default).
</p>

<pre caption="configure /etc/conf.d/net for wpa_supplicant">
<comment># Prefer wpa_supplicant over wireless-tools</comment>

<comment># It's important that we tell wpa_supplicant which driver we should
# be using as it's not very good at guessing yet</comment>
wpa_supplicant_eth0="-Dmadwifi"
</pre>

<p>
That was simple wasn't it? However, we still have to configure wpa_supplicant
itself which is a bit more tricky depending on how secure the Access Points
are that you are trying to connect to. The below example is taken and
simplified from <path>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf.example</path> which ships
with wpa_supplicant.

<title>Wireless Tools</title>

<subsection>
<title>Initial setup and Managed Mode</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html">
Wireless Tools</uri> provide a generic way to configure basic wireless
interfaces up to the WEP security level. While WEP is a weak security method
it's also the most prevalent.
</p>

<p>
Wireless Tools configuration is controlled by a few main variables. The
sample configuration file below should describe all you need. One thing to
bear in mind is that no configuration means "connect to the strongest
unencrypted Access Point" - we will always try and connect you to something.
</p>

<pre caption="Install wireless-tools">
# <i>emerge net-wireless/wireless-tools</i>
</pre>

<note>
Although you can store your wireless settings in
<path>/etc/conf.d/wireless</path> this guide recommends you store them in
<path>/etc/conf.d/net</path>
</note>

<impo>
When configuring variables against a specific ESSID, the variable may
need to be "escaped" so that it works correctly. This means that any
character which is not in the English alphabet or a number between 0 and 9
needs to be replaced with a _ character.<br/><br/>
So the ESSID "Foo Bar" becomes "Foo_Bar", and as such we can
reference it as key_Foo_Bar.
</impo>

<pre caption="sample iwconfig setup in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Prefer iwconfig over wpa_supplicant</comment>
modules=( "iwconfig" )

<comment># Configure WEP keys for Access Points called ESSID1 and ESSID2</comment>
<comment># You may configure up to 4 WEP keys, but only 1 can be active at
# any time so we supply a default index of [1] to set key [1] and then
# again afterwards to change the active key to [1]
# We do this incase you define other ESSID's to use WEP keys other than 1
# Prefixing the key with s: means it's an ASCII key, otherwise a HEX key
# enc open specified open security (most secure)
# enc restricted specified restricted security (least secure)</comment>
key_ESSID1="[1] s:yourkeyhere key [1] enc open"
key_ESSID2="[1] aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dd key [1] enc restricted"

<comment># The below only work when we scan for available Access Points</comment>

<comment># Sometimes more than one Access Point is visible so we need to
# define a preferred order to connect in</comment>
preferred_aps=( "ESSID1" "ESSID2" )
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Fine tune Access Point Selection</title>
<body>

<p>
You can add some extra options to fine-tune your Access Point selection,
but these are not normally required.
</p>

<p>
You can decide whether we only connect to preferred Access Points or not.
By default if everything configured has failed and we can connect to an
unencrypted Access Point then we will. This can be controlled by the
<c>associate_order</c> variable. Here's a table of values and how they
control this.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>any</ti>
    <ti>Default behaviour</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>preferredonly</ti>
    <ti>We will only connect to visible APs in the preferred list</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>forcepreferred</ti>
    <ti>
      We will forceably connect to APs in the preferred order if they are not
      found in a scan
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>forcepreferredonly</ti>
    <ti>
      Do not scan for APs - instead just try to connect to each one in order
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>forceany</ti>
    <ti>Same as forcepreferred + connect to any other available AP</ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Finally we have some blacklist_aps and unique_ap selection. blacklist_aps
works in a similar way to preferred_aps. unique_ap is a yes or no value
that says if a second wireless interface can connect to the same Access
Point as the first interface.
</p>

<pre caption="blacklist_aps and unique_ap example">
<comment># Sometimes you never want to connect to certain access points</comment>
blacklist_aps=( "ESSID3" "ESSID4" )

<comment># If you have more than one wireless card, you can say if you want
# to allow each card to associate with the same Access Point or not
# Values are "yes" and "no"
# Default is "yes"</comment>
unique_ap="yes"
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Ad-Hoc and Master Modes</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to set yourself up as an Ad-Hoc node if you fail to connect to
any Access Point in managed mode, you can do that too.
</p>

<pre caption="fallback to ad-hoc mode">
adhoc_essid_eth0="This Adhoc Node"
</pre>

<p>
What about connecting to Ad-Hoc networks or running in Master mode to become
an Access Point? Here's a configuration just for that! You may need to
specify WEP keys as shown above.
</p>

<pre caption="sample ad-hoc/master configuration">
<comment># Set the mode - can be managed (default), ad-hoc or master
# Not all drivers support all modes</comment>
mode_eth0="ad-hoc"

<comment># Set the ESSID of the interface
# In managed mode, this forces the interface to try and connect to the
# specified ESSID and nothing else</comment>
essid_eth0="This Adhoc Node"

<comment># We use channel 3 if you don't specify one</comment>
channel_eth0="9"
</pre>

<impo>
The below is taken verbatim from the BSD wavelan documentation found at
<uri link="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/wavelan.html">
the NetBSD documentation</uri><br/><br/>
There are 14 channels possible; We are told that channels 1-11 are legal for
North America, channels 1-13 for most of Europe, channels 10-13 for France,
and only channel 14 for Japan. If in doubt, please refer to the documentation
that came with your card or access point. Make sure that the channel you
select is the same channel your access point (or the other card in an ad-hoc
network) is on. The default for cards sold in North America and most of
Europe is 3; the default for cards sold in France is 11, and the default for
cards sold in Japan is 14.

<p>
There are some more variables you can use to help get your wireless up
and running due to driver or environment problems. Here's a table of other
things you can try.

<title>Defining network configuration per ESSID</title>
<body>

<p>
Someones when you connect to ESSID1 you need a static IP and when you
connect to ESSID2 you need DHCP. Infact most module variables we can
change per ESSID. Here's how we do this.
</p>

<note>
These work if you're using WPA Supplicant or Wireless Tools.
</note>

<pre caption="override network settings per ESSID">
config_ESSID1=( "192.168.0.3/24 brd 192.168.0.255" )
routes_ESSID1=( "default via 192.168.0.1" )

config_ESSID2=( "dhcp" )
fallback_ESSID2=( "192.168.3.4/24" )
fallback_route_ESSID2=( "default via 192.168.3.1" )

<comment># We can define nameservers and other things too</comment>
<comment># NOTE: DHCP will override these unless it's told not too</comment>
nameservers_ESSID1=( "192.168.0.1" "192.168.0.2" )
domain_ESSID1="some.domain"
searchdomains_ESSID1="search.this.domain search.that.domain"

<comment># You override by the MAC address of the Access Point
# This handy if you goto different locations that have the same ESSID</comment>
mac_config_001122334455=( "dhcp" )
mac_dhcpcd_001122334455="-t 10"
