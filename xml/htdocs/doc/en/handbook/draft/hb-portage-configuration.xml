<title>Portage Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
As noted previously, Portage is configurable through many variables which 
you should define in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>. Please refer to the
<path>make.conf</path> manpage for more and complete information:
</p>

<pre caption="Reading the make.conf manpage">
$ <i>man make.conf</i>

<title>Configure and Compiler Options</title>
<body>

<p>
When Portage builds applications, it passes the contents of the following
variables to the compiler and configure script:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    CFLAGS &amp; CXXFLAGS define the desired compiler flags for C and C++
    compiling.
  </li>
  <li>
    CHOST defines the build host information for the application's configure 
    script
  </li>
  <li>
    MAKEOPTS is passed to the <c>make</c> command and is usually set to define
    the amount of parallelism used during the compilation. More information
    about the make options can be found in the make manpage.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The USE variable is also used during configure and compilations but has been
explained in great detail in previous chapters.

<subsection>
<title>Merge Options</title>
<body>

<p>
By default, Portage will remove the temporary files it used during building
after having merged the package to the filesystem. This feature is set with the
AUTOCLEAN variable which defaults to "yes". Setting this variable to "no" will
leave the files inside <path>/var/tmp/portage</path> (or any other directory
BUILD_PREFIX refers to).
</p>

<p>
When Portage has merged a newer version of a certain software title, it will
remove the obsoleted files of the older version from your system. Portage gives
the user a 5 second delay before unmerging the older version. These 5 seconds
are defined by the CLEAN_DELAY variable.
