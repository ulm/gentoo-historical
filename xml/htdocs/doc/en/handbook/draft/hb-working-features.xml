<title>Distributed Compiling</title>
<subsection>
<title>Using distcc</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>distcc</c> is a program to distribute compilations across several, not
necessarily identical, machines on a network. The <c>distcc</c> client sends all
necessary information to the available distcc servers (running <c>distccd</c>) 
so they can compile pieces of source code for the client. The net result is a 
faster compilation time.
</p>

<p>
You can find more information about <c>distcc</c> (and how to have it work 
with Gentoo) in our <uri link="/doc/en/distcc.xml">Gentoo Distcc
Documentation</uri>.
