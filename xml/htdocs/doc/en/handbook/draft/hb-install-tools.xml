<title>System Logger</title>
<body>

<p>
When we mentioned what <e>stage3</e> was, we said that it contained all
necessary system tools for which we cannot provide a choice to our users. We 
also said that we would install the other tools later on. Well, here we are :)
</p>

<p>
The first tool you need to decide on has to provide logging facilities for your
system. Unix and Linux have an excellent history of logging capabilities -- if
you want you can log everything that happens on your system in logfiles. This
happens through the <e>system logger</e>.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo offers several system loggers to choose from. There are <c>sysklogd</c>,
which is the traditional set of system logging daemons, <c>syslog-ng</c>, an 
advanced system logger, and <c>metalog</c> which is a highly-configurable 
system logger. Others might be available through Portage as well - our number of
available packages increases on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
If you can't choose one, use <c>syslog-ng</c> as it is very powerful yet comes
with a great default configuration.
</p>

<p>
To install the system logger of your choice, <c>emerge</c> it and have it added
to the default runlevel using <c>rc-update</c>. The following example installs
<c>syslog-ng</c>. Of course substitute with your system logger:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing a system logger">
# <i>emerge syslog-ng</i>
# <i>rc-update add syslog-ng default</i>
</pre>

<title>Optional: Cron Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
Next is the cron daemon. Although it is optional and not required for your
system, it is wise to install one. But what is a cron daemon? A cron daemon 
executes scheduled commands. It is very handy if you need to execute some 
command regularly (for instance daily, weekly or monthly).
</p>

<p>
Gentoo offers three possible cron daemons: <c>dcron</c>, <c>fcron</c> and
<c>vixie-cron</c>. Installing one of them is similar to installing a system 
logger. However, <c>dcron</c> and <c>fcron</c> require an extra configuration 
command, namely <c>crontab /etc/crontab</c>. If you don't know what to choose, 
use <c>vixie-cron</c>.
</p>

<p>
We only provide <c>vixie-cron</c> for networkless installations. If you want
another cron daemon you can wait and install it later on.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing a cron daemon">
# <i>emerge vixie-cron</i>
# <i>rc-update add vixie-cron default</i>
<comment>(Only if you have chosen dcron or fcron)</comment> # <i>crontab /etc/crontab</i>
</pre>

<title>File System Tools</title>
<body>

<p>
Depending on what file systems you are using, you need to install the necessary
file system utilities (for checking the filesystem integrity, creating 
additional file systems etc.).
</p>

<p>
The following table lists the tools you need to install if you use a certain
file system:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>File System</th>
  <th>Tool</th>
  <th>Install Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>XFS</ti>
  <ti>xfsprogs</ti>
  <ti><c>emerge xfsprogs</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ReiserFS</ti>
  <ti>reiserfsprogs</ti>
  <ti><c>emerge reiserfsprogs</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>JFS</ti>
  <ti>jfsutils</ti>
  <ti><c>emerge jfsutils</c></ti>
</tr>
</table>

<!-- TODO reactivate when LVM2 instructions are boarded
<p>
If you are an LVM user, you also need to install <c>lvm-user</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing LVM utilities">
# <i>emerge - -usepkg lvm-user</i>
</pre>
-->

<p>
If you don't need <c>rp-pppoe</c> to connect to the Internet, continue with <uri
link="?part=1&amp;chap=10">Configuring the Bootloader</uri>. Otherwise
continue with <uri link="#doc_chap4">Optional: Networking Tools</uri>.

<section>
<title>Optional: Networking Tools</title>
<body>

<p>
If you need <c>rp-pppoe</c> to connect to the net, you need to install it.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing rp-pppoe">
# <i>USE="-X" emerge rp-pppoe</i>
</pre>

<p>
The <c>USE="-X"</c> will prohibit xorg-x11 to be installed as a dependency
(<c>rp-pppoe</c> has graphical tools; if you want those enabled, you can
recompile <c>rp-pppoe</c> later on or have xorg-x11 installed now -- which takes a
long time to compile).
</p>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=10">Configuring the 
Bootloader</uri>.
