<title>Network Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
We now support modular networking scripts, which means we can easily
add support for new interface types and configuration modules while keeping
compatibility with existing ones.
</p>

<p>
Modules load by default if the package they need is installed.  If
you specify a module here that doesn't have its package installed
then you get an error stating which package you need to install.
Ideally, you only use the modules setting when you have two or more
packages installed that supply the same service and you need to prefer
one over the other.
</p>

<pre caption="Module preference">
<comment># Prefer iproute2 over ifconfig</comment>
modules=( "iproute2" )

<comment># You can also specify other modules for an interface
# In this case we prefer udhcpc over dhcpcd</comment>
modules_eth0=( "udhcpc" )

<comment># You can also specify which modules not to use - for example you may be
# using a supplicant or linux-wlan-ng to control wireless configuration but
# you still want to configure network settings per ESSID associated with.</comment>
modules=( "!iwconfig" )
</pre>

<title>Interface Handlers</title>
<body>

<p>
We provide two interface handlers presently: ifconfig and iproute2.
You need one of these to do any kind of network configuration.
</p>

<p>
ifconfig is the current Gentoo default and it's included in the system profile.<br/>
iproute2 is a more powerful and flexible package, but it's not included by default.
</p>

<pre caption="To install iproute2">
# <i>emerge sys-apps/iproute2</i>

<comment># To prefer iproute2 over ifconfig if both are installed</comment>
modules=( "iproute2" )
</pre>

<p>
As both ifconfig and iproute2 do very similar things we allow their basic configuration
to work with each other. For example both the below code snippets work regardless of
which module you are using.
</p>

<pre caption="ifconfig and iproute2 examples">
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2/24" )
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0" )

<comment># We can also specify broadcast</comment>
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2/24 brd 192.168.0.255" )
config_eth0=( "192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255" )

<title>DHCP</title>
<body>

<p>
DHCP is a means of obtaining network information (IP address, DNS servers,
Gateway, etc) from a DHCP server. This means that if there is a DHCP server
running on the network, you just have to tell each client to use DHCP and it
sets up the network all by itself. Of course, you will have to configure for
other things like wireless, ppp or other things if required before you can use
DHCP.
</p>

<p>
DHCP can be provided by dhclient, dhcpcd, dhclient, pump or udhcpc. Each DHCP module
has its pros and cons - here's a quick run down.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>DHCP Module</th>
    <th>Package</th>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>dhclient</ti>
    <ti>net-misc/dhcp</ti>
    <ti>
        Made by ISC, the same people who make the BIND DNS software<br />
	Very configurable
    </ti>
    <ti>
        Configuration is overly complex<br />
	Software is quite bloated<br />
	Cannot get NTP servers from DHCP<br />
	Does not send hostname by default
    </ti>

    </ti>
    <ti>
        No longer maintained upstream<br />

	Does not daemonize when lease is infinite
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>pump</ti>
    <ti>net-misc/pump</ti>
    <ti>
        Lightweight<br />
	No reliance on outside tools
    </ti>
    <ti>

	Made for embedded systems
    </ti>
    <ti>
        Unproven - no distro uses it by default<br />
	Cannot define a timeout beyond 3 seconds
    </ti>
  </tr>
</table>
     
<p>
If you have more than one DHCP client installed, you need to specify which
one to use - otherwise we default to dhcpcd if available.
</p>

<p>
To send specific options to the dhcp module, use module_eth0="..."
<e>(change module to the DHCP module you're using - ie dhcpcd_eth0)</e>
</p>

<p>
We try and make DHCP relatively agnostic - as such we support the following
commands using the dhcp_eth0 variable. The default is not to set any of them
</p>

<ul>
  <li>release - releases the IP address for re-use</li>
  <li>nodns - don't overwrite /etc/resolv.conf</li>
  <li>nontp - don't overwrite /etc/ntp.conf</li>
  <li>nonis - don't overwrite /etc/yp.conf</li>
</ul>

<pre caption="Sample DHCP configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Only needed if you have more than one DHCP module installed</comment>
modules=( "dhcpcd" ) 

config_eth0=( "dhcp" )
dhcpcd_eth0="-t 10" <comment># Timeout after 10 seconds</comment>
dhcp_eth0="release nodns nontp nonis" <comment># Only get an address</comment>
</pre>

<note>
dhcpcd, udhcpc and pump send the current hostname to the DHCP server by
default so you don't need to specify this anymore.

<title>ADSL Modem</title>
<body>

<p>
First we need to install the ADSL software.
</p>

<pre caption="Install the rp-pppoe package">
# <i>emerge net-dialup/rp-pppoe</i>
</pre>

<warn>
baselayout-1.11.x supports PPPOE only<br/>
Hopefully future versions will support PPPOA<br/>
</warn>

<p>
Now we need to instruct configure eth0 to be an ADSL interface and enter our
username.
</p>

<pre caption="Configure eth0 for ADSL">
config_eth0=( "adsl" )
user_eth0="username"
</pre>

<p>
Finally you need to define your username and password in
<path>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</path>
</p>

<pre caption="sample /etc/ppp/pap-secrets">
<comment># The * is important</comment>
"username"	*	"password"

<title>APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)</title>
<body>

<p>
APIPA tries to find a free address in the range 169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255
by arping a random address in that range on the interface. If no reply is
found then we assign that address to the interface.
</p>

<p>
This is only useful for LANs where there is no DHCP server and you don't
connect directly to the internet and all other computers use APIPA.
</p>

<p>
For APIPA support, emerge net-misc/iputils or net-analyzer/arping
</p>

<pre caption="APIPA configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Try DHCP first - if that fails then fallback to APIPA</comment>
config_eth0=( "dhcp" )
fallback_eth0=( "apipa" )

<comment># Just use APIPA</comment>
config_eth0=( "apipa" )

<title>Bonding</title>
<body>

<p>
For link bonding/trunking emerge net-misc/ifenslave
</p>

<p>
Bonding is used to increase network bandwidth. If you have two network
cards going to the same network, you can bond them together so your
applications see just one interface but they really use both network cards.
</p>

<pre caption="bonding configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment>To bond interfaces together</comment>
slaves_bond0="eth0 eth1 eth2"

<comment># You may not want to assign an IP to the bonded interface</comment>
config_bond0=( "null" )

<comment># Depend on eth0, eth1 and eth2 as they may require extra configuration</comment>
depend_bond0() {
	need net.eth0 net.eth1 net.eth2
}
</pre>

<section>
<title>Bridging (802.1d support)</title>
<body>

<p>
For bridging support emerge net-misc/bridge-utils
</p>

<p>
Bridging is used to join networks together. For example, you may have a
server that connects to the internet via an ADSL modem and a wireless
access card to enable other computers to connect to the internet via the
ADSL modem. You could create a bridge to join the two interfaces together.
</p>

<pre caption="Bridge configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Configure the bridge - "man btctl" for more details</comment>
brctl_br0=( "setfd 0" "sethello 0" "stp off" )

<comment># To add ports to bridge br0</comment>
bridge_br0="eth0 eth1"

<comment># You need to configure the ports to null values so dhcp does not get started</comment>
config_eth0=( "null" )
config_eth1=( "null" )

<comment># Finally give the bridge an address - you could use DHCP as well</comment>
config_br0=( "192.168.0.1/24" )

<comment># Depend on eth0 and eth1 as they may require extra configuration</comment>
depend_bond0() {
	need net.eth0 net.eth1
}

<title>Tunnelling</title>
<body>

<p>
You don't need to emerge anything for tunnelling as the interface handler
can do it for you.
</p>

<pre caption="Tunnelling configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># For GRE tunnels</comment>
iptunnel_vpn0="mode gre remote 207.170.82.1 key 0xffffffff ttl 255"

<comment># For IPIP tunnels</comment>
iptunnel_vpn0="mode ipip remote 207.170.82.2 ttl 255"

<comment># To configure the interface</comment>
config_vpn0=( "192.168.0.2 peer 192.168.1.1" )

<section>
<title>VLAN (802.1q support)</title>
<body>

<p>
For VLAN support, emerge net-misc/vconfig
</p>

<p>Virtual LAN is a group of network devices that behave as if they were
connected to a single network segment - even though they may not be.
VLAN members can only see members of the same VLAN even though they may
share the same physical network.
</p>

<pre caption="VLAN configuration in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># Specify the VLAN numbers for the interface like so</comment>
<comment># Please ensure your VLAN IDs are NOT zero-padded</comment>
vlans_eth0="1 2"

<comment># You can also configure the VLAN</comment>
<comment># see for vconfig man page for more details</comment>
vconfig_eth0=( "set_name_type VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD" )
vconfig_vlan1=( "set_flag 1" "set_egress_map 2 6" )

<comment># Configure the interface as usual</comment>
config_vlan1=( "172.16.3.1 netmask 255.255.254.0" )
config_vlan2=( "172.16.2.1 netmask 255.255.254.0" )
