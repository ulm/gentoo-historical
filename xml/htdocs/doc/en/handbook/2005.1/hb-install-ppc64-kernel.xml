<title>Timezone</title>
<body>

<p>
You first need to select your timezone so that your system knows where it is
located. Look for your timezone in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>, then copy
it to <path>/etc/localtime</path>. Please avoid the
<path>/usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT*</path> timezones as their names do not
indicate the expected zones. For instance, <path>GMT-8</path> is in fact GMT+8.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the timezone information">
# <i>ls /usr/share/zoneinfo</i>
<comment>(Suppose you want to use GMT)</comment>
# <i>cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT /etc/localtime</i>

<title>Choosing a Kernel</title>
<body>

<p>
The core around which all distributions are built is the Linux kernel.
It is the layer between the user programs and your system hardware.
Gentoo provides its users several possible kernel sources. A full
listing with description is available at the <uri
link="/doc/en/gentoo-kernel.xml">Gentoo Kernel Guide</uri>.
</p>

<p>
For PPC64 you should use <c>gentoo-sources</c>. So let's continue with
<c>emerge</c>'ing the kernel sources.  The <c>USE="-doc"</c> is necessary to
avoid installing xorg-x11 or other dependencies at this point.
<c>USE="symlink"</c> is not necessary for a new install, but ensures proper
creation of the <path>/usr/src/linux</path> symlink.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing a kernel source">
# <i>USE="-doc symlink" emerge gentoo-sources</i>
</pre>

<p>
When you take a look in <path>/usr/src</path> you should see a symlink called
<path>linux</path> pointing to your kernel source. In this case, the installed
kernel source points to <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.12-r10</c>. Your version may be
different, so keep this in mind.
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the kernel source symlink">
# <i>ls -l /usr/src/linux</i>
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root    root       12 Oct 13 11:04 /usr/src/linux -&gt; linux-2.6.12-gentoo-r10
</pre>

<p>
Now it is time to configure and compile your kernel source. There is the
ability to use "genkernel" which would create a generic kernel like the
ones used on the installation CDs, but it is not fully functional for PPC64 at
the moment.
</p>

<p>
Continue now with <uri link="#manual">Manual Configuration</uri>.

<title>Manual Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Manually configuring a kernel is often seen as the most difficult procedure a
Linux user ever has to perform. Nothing is less true -- after configuring a
couple of kernels you don't even remember that it was difficult ;)
</p>

<p>
However, one thing <e>is</e> true: you must know your system when you
configuring a kernel manually. Most information can be gathered by emerging 
pciutils (<c>emerge pciutils</c>) which contains <c>lspci</c>. You will now 
be able to  use <c>lspci</c> within the chrooted environment. You may safely 
ignore any <e>pcilib</e> warnings (like pcilib: cannot open 
/sys/bus/pci/devices) that <c>lspci</c> throws out. Alternatively, you can run 
<c>lspci</c> from a <e>non-chrooted</e> environment. The results are the same. 
You can also run <c>lsmod</c> to see what kernel modules the Installation CD 
uses (it might provide you with a nice hint on what to enable).
</p>

<p>
Now go to your kernel source directory and execute <c>make
menuconfig</c>. This will fire up an ncurses-based configuration menu.
</p>

<p>
When compiling the kernel on a 32bit userland system add the following to
the bottom of /etc/profile:
</p>

<pre caption="32bit userland make alias">
# <i>echo 'alias ppc64make="make ARCH=ppc64 CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu-"' >> /etc/profile</i>
# <i>source /etc/profile</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Invoking menuconfig">
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
(64bit userland)  # <i>make menuconfig</i>
(32bit userland)  # <i>ppc64make menuconfig</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted with several configuration sections. We'll first
list some options you must activate (otherwise Gentoo will not function,
or not function properly without additional tweaks).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Activating Required Options</title>
<body>

<p>
First of all, activate the use of development and experimental
code/drivers. You need this, otherwise some very important code/drivers
won't show up:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting experimental code/drivers, General setup">
Code maturity level options ---&gt;
  [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
General setup --->
  [*] Support for hot-pluggable devices
</pre>

<p>
Now go to <c>File Systems</c> and select support for the filesystems you
use. <e>Don't</e> compile them as modules, otherwise your Gentoo system
will not be able to mount your partitions. Also select <c>Virtual
memory</c>, <c>/proc file system</c>, and <c>/dev/pts file system for
Unix98 PTYs</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting necessary file systems">
File systems ---&gt;
  [*] Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
  [*] /proc file system support
  [*] /dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs

<comment>(Select one or more of the following options as needed by your system)</comment>
  &lt;*&gt; Reiserfs support
  &lt;*&gt; Ext3 journalling file system support
  &lt;*&gt; JFS filesystem support
  &lt;*&gt; Second extended fs support
  &lt;*&gt; XFS filesystem support
</pre>

<note>
You will find some of the mentioned options under <c>Pseudo
filesystems</c> which is a subpart of <c>File systems</c>.
</note>

<p>
If you are using PPPoE to connect to the Internet or you are using a
dial-up modem, you will need the following options in the kernel (you
will find the mentioned options under <c>Networking support</c> which is
a subpart of <c>Device Drivers</c>):
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting PPPoE necessary drivers">
Network device support ---&gt;
  &lt;*&gt; PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
  &lt;*&gt;   PPP support for async serial ports
  &lt;*&gt;   PPP support for sync tty ports
</pre>

<p>
The two compression options won't harm but are not definitely needed, neither
does the <c>PPP over Ethernet</c> option, that might only be used by 
<c>rp-pppoe</c> when configured to do kernel mode PPPoE.
</p>

<p>
If you require it, don't forget to include support in the kernel for your
ethernet card.
</p>

<p>
Disable ADB raw keycodes:
</p>

<pre caption="Disabling ADB raw keycodes">
Macintosh Device Drivers ---&gt;
  [ ] Support for ADB raw keycodes
</pre>

<p>
When you're done configuring your kernel, continue with <uri
link="#compiling">Compiling and Installing</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="compiling">
<title>Compiling and Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured, it is time to compile and install it. Exit 
the configuration and start the compilation process:
</p>

<pre caption="Compiling the kernel">
(64bit userland)  # <i>make &amp;&amp; make modules_install</i>
(32bit userland)  # <i>ppc64make &amp;&amp; ppc64make modules_install</i>
</pre>

<p>
When the kernel has finished compiling, copy the kernel image to
<path>/boot</path>. Remember to replace <path>&lt;kernel-version&lt;</path>
with your actual kernel version: 
</p>

<pre caption="Installing the kernel">
# <i>cp vmlinux /boot/&lt;kernel-version&lt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#kernel_modules">Configuring the Modules</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
</section>
<section id="kernel_modules">
<title>Configuring the Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
You should list the modules you want automatically loaded in 
<path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path>. You can add extra
options to the modules too if you want.
</p>

<p>
To view all available modules, run the following <c>find</c> command. Don't
forget to substitute "&lt;kernel version&gt;" with the version of the kernel you
just compiled:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing all available modules">
# <i>find /lib/modules/&lt;kernel version&gt;/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko'</i>
</pre>

<p>
For instance, to automatically load the <c>3c59x.o</c> module, edit the
<path>kernel-2.6</path> file and enter the module name in it.
</p>

<pre caption="Editing /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6">
# <i>nano -w /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6">
3c59x
</pre>

<p>
Continue the installation with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=8">Configuring 
your System</uri>.
