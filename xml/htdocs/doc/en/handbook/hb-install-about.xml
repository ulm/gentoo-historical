<title>Welcome!</title>
<body>

<p>
First of all, <e>welcome</e> to Gentoo. You are about to enter the world
of choices and performance. Choices are all what Gentoo is about. When
installing Gentoo, this is made clear to you several times -- you can
choose how much you want to compile yourself, how to install Gentoo,
what system logger you want, etc.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo is a fast, modern metadistribution with a clean and flexible
design. Gentoo is built around free software and doesn't hide to its
users what is beneath the hood. Portage, the package maintenance system
which Gentoo uses, is built in Python, meaning you can easily view and
modify the source code. Gentoo's packaging system uses source code
(although support for precompiled packages is included too) and
configuring Gentoo happens through regular textfiles. In other words,
openness everywhere.
</p>

<p>
It is very important that you understand that <e>choices</e> is what
makes Gentoo run. We try not to force you onto anything you don't like.
If you feel like we do, please <uri

<title>How is the Installation Structured?</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo Installation can be seen as a 10-step procedure,
corresponding to sections 2 - 11 of this chapter. Every step results in
a certain state:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  After step 1, you are in a working environment ready to install Gentoo
</li>
<li>
  After step 2, your internet connection is ready to install Gentoo
  (this can be optional in certain situations)
</li>
<li>
  After step 3, your hard disks are initialised to house your Gentoo
  installation
</li>
<li>
  After step 4, your installation environment is prepared and you are
  chrooted into the new environment
</li>
<li>
  After step 5, core packages, which are the same on all Gentoo
  installations, are installed
</li>
<li>
  After step 6, you have compiled your Linux kernel
</li>
<li>
  After step 7, you have written most of your Gentoo system
  configuration files
</li>
<li>
  After step 8, your choice of bootloader has been installed and
  configured
</li>
<li>
  After step 9, necessary system tools (which you can choose from a nice
  list) are installed
</li>
<li>
  After step 10, you are logged in into your new Gentoo installation
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you are given a certain choice, we try to explain to our best
effort what the pros and cons are. We will continue then with a default
choice, identified by &quot;Default: &quot; in the title. The other
possibilities are marked by &quot;Alternative: &quot;. Do <e>not</e>
think that the default is what we recommend. It is however what we
believe most users will use.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you can persue an optional step. Such steps are marked as
&quot;Optional: &quot; and are therefor not needed to install Gentoo.
However, some optional steps are depending on a previous decision you
made. We will inform you when this happens, both when you make the
decision, and right before the optional step is described.

<title>Troubles?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you find a problem in the installation (or in the installation
documentation), please visit our <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugtracking system</uri> and search if the
bug is known. If not, please create a bugreport for it so we can take
care of it. Do not be afraid of the developers who are assigned to
(your) bugs -- they generally don't eat people.
</p>

<p>
If you are uncertain if the problem is a user-problem (some error you
made despite having read the documentation carefully) or a
software-problem (some error we made despite having tested the
installation/documentation carefully) you are free to join #gentoo on
irc.freenode.net. Ofcourse, you are welcome otherwise too :)
</p>

just ask on #gentoo, our chatchannel on irc.freenode.net. Yes several of
us are freaks who sit on IRC :-)
