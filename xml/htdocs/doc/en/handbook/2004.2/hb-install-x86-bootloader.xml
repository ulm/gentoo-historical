<title>Making your Choice</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured and compiled and the necessary system
configuration files are filled in correctly, it is time to install a
program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Such a
program is called a <e>bootloader</e>. For x86, Gentoo Linux provides <uri
link="#grub">GRUB</uri> and <uri link="#lilo">LILO</uri>. But before we
install one of these two bootloaders, we inform you how to configure framebuffer
(assuming you want it of course). With framebuffer you can run the Linux command
line with (limited) graphical features (such as using the nice bootsplash
image Gentoo provides).
</p>

</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Framebuffer</title>
<body>

<p>
<e>If</e> you have configured your kernel with framebuffer support (or you used
<c>genkernel</c>'s default kernel configuration), you
have to add a <c>vga</c>- or <c>video</c>-statement to your bootloader 
configuration file if you require framebuffer. The former is for 2.4 kernels 
while you should use the latter for 2.6 kernels. The next table lists the 
available <c>vga</c>-values you can use. In the example configuration files 
we use <e>800x600 @ 16bpp</e> for 2.4 kernels, thus <e>788</e>.
</p>

<p>
For the <c>vga</c>-statement:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <ti></ti><th>640x480</th><th>800x600</th><th>1024x768</th><th>1280x1024</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>8 bpp</th><ti>769</ti><ti>771</ti><ti>773</ti><ti>775</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>16 bpp</th><ti>785</ti><ti>788</ti><ti>791</ti><ti>794</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>32 bpp</th><ti>786</ti><ti>789</ti><ti>792</ti><ti>795</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
For the <c>video</c>-statement, a simplified syntax is used. Most of the time
it's sufficient to use <c>video=vesafb</c>. 
</p>

<p>
More information can be found in 
<path>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt</path>.
</p>


<p>
Remember (or write down) your value; you will need it shortly.
</p>

<p>
Now continue by installing <uri link="#grub">GRUB</uri> <e>or</e> <uri
link="#lilo">LILO</uri>.

<title>Default: Using GRUB</title>
<subsection>
<title>Understanding GRUB's terminology</title>
<body>

<p>
The most critical part of understanding GRUB is getting comfortable with
how GRUB refers to hard drives and partitions. Your Linux partition
<path>/dev/hda1</path> is called <path>(hd0,0)</path> under GRUB. Notice the 
parenthesis around the <path>hd0,0</path> - they are required.
</p>

<p>
Hard drives count from zero rather than "a" and partitions start at zero 
rather than one. Be aware too that with the hd devices, only hard drives are 
counted, not atapi-ide devices such as cdrom players and burners.  Also, the 
same construct is used with scsi drives. (Normally they get higher numbers 
than ide drives except when the bios is configured to boot from scsi devices.)
</p>

<p>
Assuming you have a hard drive on <path>/dev/hda</path>, a cdrom player on 
<path>/dev/hdb</path>, a burner on <path>/dev/hdc</path>, a second hard drive 
on <path>/dev/hdd</path> and no SCSI hard drive, <path>/dev/hdd7</path> gets 
translated to <path>(hd1,6)</path>. It might sound tricky and tricky it is 
indeed, but as we will see, GRUB offers a tab completion mechanism
that comes handy for those of you having a lot of hard drives and
partitions and who are a little lost in the GRUB numbering scheme.
</p>

<p>
Having gotten the feel for that, it is time to install GRUB.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Installing GRUB</title>
<body>

<p>
To install GRUB, let's first emerge it:
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing GRUB">
# <i>emerge grub</i>
</pre>

<p>
Although GRUB is now installed, we still need to write up a
configuration file for it and place GRUB in our MBR so that GRUB automatically 
boots your newly created kernel. Create <path>/boot/grub/grub.conf</path> with
<c>nano</c> (or, if applicable, another editor):
</p>

<pre caption = "Creating /boot/grub/grub.conf">
# <i>nano -w /boot/grub/grub.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we are going to write up a <path>grub.conf</path>. Below you'll
find two possible <path>grub.conf</path> for the partitioning example we use 
in this guide, with kernel image <path>kernel-2.4.26-gentoo-r6</path>. We've 
only extensively commented the first <path>grub.conf</path>. Make sure you use
<e>your</e> kernel image filename and, if appropriate, <e>your</e> initrd image
filename.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The first <path>grub.conf</path> is for people who have not used 
    <c>genkernel</c> to build their kernel
  </li>
  <li>
    The second <path>grub.conf</path> is for people who have used
    <c>genkernel</c> to build their kernel
  </li>
</ul>

<pre caption = "grub.conf for non-genkernel users">
<comment># Which listing to boot as default. 0 is the first, 1 the second etc.</comment>
default 0
<comment># How many seconds to wait before the default listing is booted.</comment>

<comment># Only in case you want to dual-boot</comment>
title=Windows XP
root (hd0,5)
makeactive
chainloader +1
</pre>


<note>
If you use a different partitioning scheme and/or kernel image, adjust 
accordingly. However, make sure that anything that follows a GRUB-device 
(such as <path>(hd0,0)</path>) is relative to the mountpoint, not the root. In 
other words, <path>(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz</path> is in reality 
<path>/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz</path> since <path>(hd0,0)</path> is 
<path>/boot</path>.
</note>

<p>
If you need to pass any additional options to the kernel, simply add
them to the end of the kernel command. We're already passing one option
(<c>root=/dev/hda3</c> or <c>real_root=/dev/hda3</c>), but you can pass others 
as well. As an example we use the <c>vga</c> statement for framebuffer we 
discussed previously:
</p>

<pre caption = "Adding the vga-statement as a kernel option">
title=Gentoo Linux 2.4.26-r6
  root (hd0,0)
  kernel /kernel-2.4.26-gentoo-r6 root=/dev/hda3 vga=788
</pre>

<p>
If you're using a 2.6.7 or higher kernel and you jumpered your harddrive
because the BIOS can't handle large harddrives you'll need to append
<c>hdx=stroke</c>.
</p>

<p>
<c>genkernel</c> users should know that their kernels use the same boot options
as is used for the LiveCD. For instance, if you have SCSI devices, you should
add <c>doscsi</c> as kernel option.
</p>

<p>
Now save the <path>grub.conf</path> file and exit. You still need to install 
GRUB in the MBR (Master Boot Record) so that GRUB is automatically executed when
you boot your system.
</p>

<p>
The GRUB developers recommend the use of <c>grub-install</c>. However, if for
some reason <c>grub-install</c> fails to work correctly you still have the
option to manually install GRUB.
</p>

<p>
Continue with <uri link="#grub-install-auto">Default: Setting up GRUB using
grub-install</uri> or <uri link="#grub-install-manual">Alternative: Setting up
GRUB using manual instructions</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="grub-install-auto">
<title>Default: Setting up GRUB using grub-install</title>
<body>

<p>
To install GRUB you will need to issue the <c>grub-install</c> command. However,
<c>grub-install</c> won't work off-the-shelf since we are inside a chrooted
environment. We need to update <path>/etc/mtab</path> (the file with information
about all mounted filesystems) first: luckily there is an easy way to accomplish
this - just copy over <path>/proc/mounts</path> to <path>/etc/mtab</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Updating /etc/mtab">
# <i>cp /proc/mounts /etc/mtab</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we can install GRUB using <c>grub-install</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Running grub-install">
# <i>grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you have more questions regarding GRUB, please consult the <uri
link="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-faq.html">GRUB FAQ</uri> or the <uri
link="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/">GRUB Manual</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Continue with <uri link="#reboot">Rebooting the System</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="grub-install-manual">
<title>Alternative: Setting up GRUB using manual instructions</title>
<body>

<p>
To start configuring GRUB, you type in <c>grub</c>. You'll be presented
with the <path>grub&gt;</path> grub command-line prompt. Now, you need to type 
in the right commands to install the GRUB boot record onto your hard drive.
</p>

<pre caption =" Starting the GRUB shell">
# <i>grub</i>
</pre>

<note>
If your system does not have any floppy drives, add the <c>--no-floppy</c>
option to the above command to prevent grub from probing the (non-existing) 
floppy drives.
</note>

<p>
In the example configuration we want to install GRUB so that it reads its 
information from the boot-partition <path>/dev/hda1</path>, and installs the 
GRUB boot record on the hard drive's MBR (master boot record) so that the first
thing we see when we turn on the computer is the GRUB prompt. Of course, if you
haven't followed the example configuration during the installation,
change the commands accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The tab completion mechanism of GRUB can be used from within GRUB.
For instance, if you type in "<c>root (</c>" followed by a TAB, you will
be presented with a list of devices (such as <path>hd0</path>). If you
type in "<c>root (hd0,</c>" followed by a TAB, you will receive a list
of available partitions to choose from (such as <path>hd0,0</path>).
</p>

<p>
By using the tab completion, setting up GRUB should be not that hard.
Now go on, configure GRUB, shall we? :-)
</p>

grub&gt; <i>quit</i>                  <comment>(Exit the GRUB shell)</comment>
</pre>

<note>
If you want to install GRUB in a certain partition instead of the MBR,
you have to alter the <c>setup</c> command so it points to the right
partition. For instance, if you want GRUB installed in
<path>/dev/hda3</path>, then the command becomes <c>setup (hd0,2)</c>.
Few users however want to do this.

<title>Alternative: Using LILO</title>
<subsection>
<title>Installing LILO</title>
<body>

<p>
LILO, the LInuxLOader, is the tried and true workhorse of Linux
bootloaders. However, it lacks some features that GRUB has (which is
also the reason why GRUB is currently gaining popularity). The reason
why LILO is still used is that, on some systems, GRUB doesn't work and
LILO does. Of course, it is also used because some people know LILO and
want to stick with it. Either way, Gentoo supports both, and apparently
you have chosen to use LILO.
</p>

<p>
Installing LILO is a breeze; just use <c>emerge</c>.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing LILO">
# <i>emerge --usepkg lilo</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Configuring LILO</title>
<body>

<p>
To configure LILO, you must create <path>/etc/lilo.conf</path>. Fire up
your favorite editor (in this handbook we use <c>nano</c> for
consistency) and create the file.
</p>

<pre caption = "Creating /etc/lilo.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/lilo.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Some sections ago we have asked you to remember the kernel-image name
you have created. In the next example <path>lilo.conf</path> we assume
the imagename is <path>kernel-2.4.26-gentoo-r6</path>. We also use the
example partitioning scheme in this example. There are two separate parts: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    One for those who have not used <c>genkernel</c> to build their kernel
  </li>
  <li>
    One for those who have used <c>genkernel</c> to build their kernel
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Make sure you use <e>your</e> kernel image filename and, if appropriate,
<e>your</e> initrd image filename.

</pre>

<note>
If you use a different partitioning scheme and/or kernel image, adjust
accordingly.
</note>

<p>
If you need to pass any additional options to the kernel, add an
<c>append</c> statement to the section. As an example, we add the
<c>vga=788</c> statement to enable framebuffer:
</p>

<pre caption = "Using append to add kernel options">
image=/boot/kernel-2.4.26-gentoo-r6
  label=gentoo
  read-only
  root=/dev/hda3
  <i>append="vga=788"</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you're using a 2.6.7 or higher kernel and you jumpered your harddrive
because the BIOS can't handle large harddrives you'll need to append
<c>hdx=stroke</c>.
</p>

<p>
<c>genkernel</c> users should know that their kernels use the same boot options
as is used for the LiveCD. For instance, if you have SCSI devices, you should
add <c>doscsi</c> as kernel option.
</p>


<p>
Now save the file and exit. To finish up, you have to run <c>/sbin/lilo</c> so
LILO can apply the <path>/etc/lilo.conf</path> to your system (i.e. install
itself on the disk). Keep in mind that you'll also have to rerun
<c>/sbin/lilo</c> every time you install a new kernel or make any changes to
the menu.
</p>

<pre caption = "Finishing the LILO installation">
# <i>/sbin/lilo</i>

<p>
You can now continue with <uri link="#reboot">Rebooting the System</uri>.
