<title>Hardware Requirements</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Before we start, we first list what hardware requirements you need to
successfully install Gentoo on your box. This of course depends on your
architecture.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>The AMD64 Architecture</title>
<body>

<p>
Check the following requirements before you continue with the Gentoo 
installation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  You need at least 1 Gb of free disk space
</li>
<li>
  If you do not use prebuilt packages, you need at least 300 Mb of memory (RAM +
  swap)
</li>
<li>
  You should check the <uri link="http://amd64.gentoo.org/technotes.xml">Gentoo
  AMD64 Project Page</uri> before proceeding.

<title>Make your Choice</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Still interested in trying out Gentoo? Well, then it is now time to
choose the installation medium you want to use. Yes, you have the
choice, no, they are not all equal, and yes, the result is always the same: a
Gentoo base system.
</p>

<p>
The installation media we will describe are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Gentoo's Minimal LiveCD</li>
<li>Gentoo's Universal LiveCD</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every single media has its advantages and disadvantages. We will list
the pros and cons of every medium so you have all the information to
make a justified decision. But before we continue, let's explain our
three-stage installation.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>The Three Stages</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using one of three <e>stage</e> tarball files.
The one you choose depends on how much of the system you want to compile
yourself. The <e>stage1</e> tarball is used when you want to bootstrap and
build the entire system from scratch. The <e>stage2</e> tarball is used for
building the entire system from a bootstrapped &quot;semi-compiled&quot; state.
The <e>stage3</e> tarball already contains a basic Gentoo Linux system that has
been built for you. As we will explain later, you can also install
Gentoo without compiling anything (except your kernel and some optional 
packages). If you want this, you have to use a <e>stage3</e> tarball.
</p>

<p>
Now what stage do you have to choose?
</p>

<p>
Starting from a <e>stage1</e> allows you to have total control over the
optimization settings and optional build-time functionality that is
initially enabled on your system. This makes <e>stage1</e> installs good for
power users who know what they are doing. It is also a great
installation method for those who would like to know more about the
inner workings of Gentoo Linux.
</p>

<p>
A <e>stage1</e> installation can only be performed when you have a working
Internet connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Stage1</th>
  <th>Pros and Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>
    Allows you to have total control over the optimization settings and optional
    build-time functionality that is initially enabled on your system
  </ti>

    If you don't intend to tweak the settings, it is probably a waste of time
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>
    Not suitable for networkless installations
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<e>Stage2</e> installs allow you to skip the bootstrap process and doing this
is fine if you are happy with the optimization settings that we chose
for your particular <e>stage2</e> tarball.
</p>

<p>
A <e>stage2</e> installation can only be performed when you have a working
Internet connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Stage2</th>
  <th>Pros and Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>You don't need to bootstrap</ti>

<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>Faster than starting with stage1</ti>

<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>You can still tweak your settings</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You cannot tweak as much as with a stage1</ti>

  <th>-</th>
  <ti>It's not the fastest way to install Gentoo</ti>

<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You have to accept the optimizations we chose for the bootstrap</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>
    Not suitable for networkless installations
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Choosing to go with a <e>stage3</e> allows for the fastest install of Gentoo
Linux, but also means that your base system will have the optimization
settings that we chose for you (which to be honest, are good settings
and were carefully chosen to enhance performance while maintaining
stability). <e>stage3</e> is also required if you want to install Gentoo using
prebuilt packages or without a network connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Stage3</th>
  <th>Pros and Cons</th>

  <th>+</th>
  <ti>Fastest way to get a Gentoo base system</ti>

<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You cannot tweak the base system - it's built already</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You cannot brag about having used stage1 or stage2</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Write down (or remember) what stage you want to use. You need this later when
you decide what LiveCD (or other installation medium) you want to use. You might
be interested to know that, if you decide to use different optimization settings
after having installed Gentoo, you will be able to recompile your entire system
with the new optimization settings.
</p>

<p>
Now take a look at the available installation media.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo LiveCDs</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo LiveCDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All LiveCDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet. However, some
LiveCDs also contain all necessary source code so you are able to install 
Gentoo without a working network configuration.
</p>

<p>
Now what do these LiveCDs contain?
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Minimal LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
This is a small, no-nonsense, bootable CD which sole purpose is to boot the 
system, prepare the networking and continue with the Gentoo installation. It 
does not contain any stages (or, in some cases, a single stage1 file), 
source code or precompiled packages. For example the amd64 variant of this 
LiveCD can be found in the <path>releases/amd64/2004.1/livecd</path> directory 
and is called <c>install-amd64-minimal-2004.1.iso</c>.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Minimal LiveCD</th>
  <th>Pros and Cons</th>

<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>Smallest download</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>Suitable for a complete architecture</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>
    You can do a stage1, stage2 or stage3 by getting the stage tarball off the
    net
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>
    Contains no stages, no Portage snapshot, no GRP packages and therefore not 
    suitable for networkless installation
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Universal LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo's Universal LiveCD is a bootable CD suitable to install Gentoo without
networking. It contains a stage1 and a stage3 tarball (optimized for AMD64). 
For example the amd64 variant of this CD is called 
<c>install-amd64-universal-2004.1.iso</c> and can be found in the
<path>releases/amd64/2004.1/livecd</path> subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
If you take a closer look on our mirrors you will see
that we also provide a <e>Gentoo Package CD</e>. This CD (which isn't
bootable) only contains precompiled packages and can be used to install software
after a succesfull Gentoo Installation. To install Gentoo, you only 
need the Universal LiveCD, but if you want OpenOffice.org, Mozilla, KDE, GNOME 
etc. without having to compile every single one of them, you need the Packages 
CD too. The AMD64 Packages CD is called <c>packages-amd64-2004.1.iso</c>.
</p>

<p>
You only need the Packages CD if you want to perform a stage3 with GRP
installation.
</p>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the LiveCDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo LiveCD (if not, then you are reading the
wrong section). We'll first start by downloading and burning the chosen
LiveCD. We previously discussed the several available LiveCDs, but where can you
find them? 
</p>

<p>
Go to the main Gentoo directory on any of our <uri 
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. You will find the Gentoo LiveCDs in
the <path>releases/amd64/2004.1/livecd</path> directory. Inside that
directory you'll find so-called ISO-files. Those are full CD images
which you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can
check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we provide (such as
<path>install-amd64-minimal-2004.1.iso.md5</path>). You can check the MD5 
checksum with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public key:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc</c> (replace
    <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device path) followed
    by the path to the ISO file :)
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the AMD64 LiveCD(s)</title>
<body>

<p>
Once you have burned your installation CDs, it is time to boot them.
Remove all CDs from the CD drives, reboot your system and enter the BIOS. 
This is usually done by hitting DEL, F1
or ESC, depending on your BIOS. Inside the BIOS, change the boot
order so that the CD-ROM is tried before the hard disk. This is often found
under "CMOS Setup". If you don't do this, your system will just reboot from the 
hard disk, ignoring the CD-ROM.
</p>

<p>
Now place the installation CD in the CD-ROM drive (duh) and reboot. You
should see a fancy boot screen with the Gentoo Linux logo on it. At this
screen, you can hit Enter to begin the boot process with the default
boot options, or boot the LiveCD with custom boot options by specifying a 
kernel followed by boot options and then hitting Enter. 
</p>

<p>
Specifying a kernel? Yes, we provide several kernels on our LiveCDs. The
default one is <c>gentoo</c>. Other kernels are <c>smp</c>, which activates 
support for multi-cpu systems and the <c>-nofb</c> variants which disable
framebuffer. We also provide <c>emachines</c> for emachines m6805/7 laptops.
</p>

<p>
Below you'll find a short overview on the available kernels:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Kernel</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>gentoo</ti>
  <ti>Default kernel with framebuffer support</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>smp</ti>
  <ti>Kernel with support for multiple CPUs</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>gentoo-nofb</ti>
  <ti>Same as <c>gentoo</c> but without framebuffer support</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>smp-nofb</ti>
  <ti>Same as <c>smp</c> but without framebuffer support</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>emachines</ti>
  <ti>Kernel for booting emachines m6805/7 laptops</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<note>
Some LiveCDs provide extra kernels, or don't provide kernels listed in
this document. To list the available kernels at boot-time, press F1 when
you are at the bootscreen.
</note>

<p>
You can also provide kernel options. They represent optional settings
you can (de)activate at will. The following code listing explains all available
kernel options.
</p>

<pre caption="Available boot options">
acpi        - Activate ACPI support
doataraid   - Activate support for ATA RAID devices
dofirewire  - Activate support for FireWire devices
dopcmcia    - Activate PCMCIA support
doscsi      - Activate support for SCSI devices
noapm       - Deactivate APM support
nodetect    - Deactivate hardware detection (kudzu/hotplug)
nodhcp      - Do not use DHCP to query for an IP address
noevms      - Deactivate EVMS support
nohotplug   - Deactivate hotplug (kernel loading program)
nousb       - Deactivate USB support
ide=nodma   - Deactivate DMA support
</pre>

<p>
Now boot your CD, select a kernel (if you are not happy with the default
<c>gentoo</c> kernel) and boot options. As an example, we show you how
to boot the <c>gentoo</c> kernel, with <c>dopcmcia</c> as kernel
parameters:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting a LiveCD">
boot: <i>gentoo dopcmcia</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will then be greeted with another boot screen and progress bar. Once
the boot process completes, you will be automatically logged in to the
&quot;Live&quot; Gentoo Linux as &quot;root&quot;, the super user. You should 
have a root (&quot;#&quot;) prompt on the current console and can also switch 
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one 
you started on by pressing Alt-F1.
</p>

<p>
If you are installing Gentoo on a system with a non-US keyboard, use
<c>loadkeys</c> to load the keymap for your keyboard. To list the available
keymaps, execute <c>ls /usr/share/keymaps</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Listing available keymaps">
# <i>ls /usr/share/keymaps</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now load the keymap of your choice:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading a keymap">
# <i>loadkeys be-latin1</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware 
Configuration</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="hardware">
<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
When the Live CD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware devices and
loads the appropriate kernel modules to support your hardware. In the
vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However, in some cases (the
SPARC LiveCDs don't even do autodetection), it may not auto-load the kernel 
modules you need. If the PCI auto-detection missed some of your system's 
hardware, you will have to load the appropriate kernel modules manually. 
</p>

<p>
In the next example we try to load the <c>8139too</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe 8139too</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Tweaking Hard Disk Performance</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are an advanced user, you might want to tweak the IDE hard disk
performance using <c>hdparm</c>. With the <c>-tT</c> options you can
test the performance of your disk (execute it several times to get a
more precise impression):
</p>

<pre caption="Testing disk performance">
# <i>hdparm -tT /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

<p>
To tweak, you can use any of the following examples (or experiment
yourself) which use <path>/dev/hda</path> as disk (substitute with your
disk):
</p>

<pre caption="Tweaking hard disk performance">
<comment>Activate DMA:</comment>                                       # <i>hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda</i>
<comment>Activate DMA + Safe Performance-enhancing Options:</comment>  # <i>hdparm -d 1 -A 1 -m 16 -u 1 -a 64 /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook (either from-CD or online) during the
installation, make sure you have created a user account (see <uri
link="#useraccounts">Optional: User Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to
go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>links2</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>links2 /mnt/cdrom/docs/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD. You can view it using <c>links2</c>
as well, but only after having completed the <e>Configuring your Network</e>
chapter (otherwise you won't be able to go on the Internet to view the
document):
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>links2 http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
