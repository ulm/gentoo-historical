<title>Who can do without?</title>
<body>

<p>
Depending on the medium you chose to install Gentoo from, you can or
cannot continue without networking (and Internet). No, we are not
playing with your mind =) 
</p>

<p>
Gentoo can always be installed with a working Internet connection.
If you want to install Gentoo without one, you need to use one of the
following installation mediums:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Gentoo x86 2-CD Installation LiveCD set (including all subarchitectures, 
    like i486, i586, pentium, athlon-xp, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Gentoo PPC 2-CD Installation LiveCD set (including all subarchitectures,
    like G3 and G4)
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Why do I need networking?</title>
<body>

<p>
Installing Gentoo from the Internet results in a fully updated Gentoo
Installation. You'll have an installation based on the most recent
Portage (which is the collection of packages we provide together with
the tools to manage your software). This is also the reason why a
network-installation is preferred. However, some people cannot install
Gentoo from a system attached to the Internet...
</p>

<p>
For those people, some architectures provide a LiveCD with all necessary
sourcecode and tools to install a Gentoo base system (or even beyond).
However, this does come with the price of having not extremely recent
software (although the differences between versions are slim).
</p>

<p>
Some paragraphs above we've explained who can use a networkless
installation. If you do not plan on using the network <e>and</e> you
use one of the listed installation mediums, then you can skip
the rest of this section and continue with <uri 
link="?part=1&amp;chap=4">Preparing the Disks</uri>.
Otherwise, continue with the networking configuration sections below.

<subsection>
<title>Optional: Configure Proxy</title>
<body>

<p>
If you access the Internet through a proxy, you might need to setup proxy
information during the installation. It is very easy to define a proxy: you just
need to define a variable which contains the proxy server information. 
</p>

<p>
In most cases, you can just define the variables using the server hostname. As
an example, we assume the proxy is called <e>proxy.gentoo.org</e> and the port
is 8080.
</p>

<pre caption="Defining proxy servers">
<comment>(If the proxy filters HTTP traffic)</comment>
# <i>export http_proxy="http://proxy.gentoo.org:8080"</i>
<comment>(If the proxy filters FTP traffic)</comment>
# <i>export ftp_proxy="ftp://proxy.gentoo.org:8080"</i>
<comment>(If the proxy filters RSYNC traffic)</comment>
# <i>export rsync_proxy="rsync://proxy.gentoo.org:8080"</i>
</pre>

<p>
If your proxy requires a username and password, you should use the following
syntax for the variable:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding username/password to the proxy variable">
http://username:password@server
</pre>

<p>
For instance, for HTTP proxying with our previous proxy server and a username 
of "john" with a password of "f00b_r" one would use:
</p>

<pre caption="Authenticated Proxy">
# <i>export http_proxy="http://john:f00b_r@proxy.gentoo.org:8080"</i>
</pre>

<title>Networking from non-Gentoo Installation Mediums</title>
<body>

<p>
Most information in this section is meant for users who booted from a
Gentoo LiveCD. However, you can install Gentoo from several other media.
If you are in such a situation, make sure that the used medium has a
working Internet connection and continue with <uri

<title>Automatic Network Detection</title>
<subsection>
<title>Maybe it just works?</title>
<body>

<p>
If your system is plugged into an Ethernet network with a DHCP server, it is 
very likely that your networking configuration has already been set up 
automatically for you. If so, you should be able to take advantage of the many
included network-aware commands on the LiveCD such as <c>ssh</c>, <c>scp</c>, 
<c>ping</c>, <c>irssi</c>, <c>wget</c> and <c>links</c>, among others.
</p>

<p>
If networking has been configured for you, the <c>/sbin/ifconfig</c> command
should list some network interfaces besides lo, such as eth0:
</p>

<pre caption="/sbin/ifconfig for a working network card">
# <i>/sbin/ifconfig</i>
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:50:BA:8F:61:7A

<title>Testing the Network</title>
<body>

<p>
You may want to try pinging your ISP's DNS server (found in
<path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>) and a Web site of choice, just to make sure 
that your packets are reaching the net, DNS name resolution is working 
correctly, etc..
</p>

<pre caption="Further network testing">
# <i>ping -c 3 www.yahoo.com</i>

Are you able to use your network? If so, you can skip the rest of this

<title>Automatic Network Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
If the network doesn't work immediately, you have the choice to use
<c>net-setup</c> (for regular networks) or <c>adsl-setup</c> (for ADSL-users).
As most users need to get a regular network up and running, this is default.
ADSL-users should read <uri link="#doc_chap3_sect3">Alternative: Using 
RP-PPPoE</uri> instead. 
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Default: Using net-setup</title>
<body>

<p>
The simplest way to set up networking if it didn't get configured
automatically is to run the <c>net-setup</c> script:
</p>

<pre caption="Running the net-setup script">
# <i>net-setup eth0</i>
</pre>

<p>
<c>net-setup</c> will ask you some questions about your network
environment. When all is done, you should have a working network
connection. Test your network connection as stated before. If the tests
are positive, congratulations! You are now ready to install Gentoo. Skip
the rest of this section and continue with <uri 
link="?part=1&amp;chap=4">Preparing the Disks</uri>.
</p>

<p>
If your network still doesn't work, continue with <uri link="#doc_chap4">Manual
Network Configuration</uri>.
</p>


</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Alternative: Using RP-PPPoE</title>
<body>

<p>
Assuming you need PPPoE to connect to the internet, the LiveCD (any version) has
made things easy for you by including <c>rp-pppoe</c>. Use the provided 
<c>adsl-setup</c> script to configure your connection. You will be prompted for
the ethernet device that is connected to your adsl modem, your username and 
password, the IPs of your DNS servers and if you need a basic firewall or not.
</p>

<pre caption="Using rp-pppoe">
# <i>adsl-setup</i>
# <i>adsl-start</i>
</pre>

<p>
If something goes wrong, double-check that you correctly typed your username and
password by looking at <path>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</path> or 
<path>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</path> and make sure you are using the right 
ethernet device. If your ethernet device doesn't exist, you will have to load
the appropriate network modules. Read on, we explain this next.

<title>Manual Network Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<title>Loading the Appropriate Network Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
When the Live CD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware devices and
loads the appropiate kernel modules (drivers) to support your hardware. In the
vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However, in some cases,
it may not auto-load the kernel modules you need.
</p>

<p>
If <c>net-setup</c> or <c>adsl-setup</c> failed, then you can safely assume that
your networkcard wasn't found immediately. This means you will have to load
the appropriate kernel modules manually.
</p>

<p>
To find out what kernel modules we provide for networking, use
<c>ls</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Searching for provided modules">
# <i>ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you find a driver for your network card, use <c>modprobe</c> to load
the kernel module:
</p>

<pre caption="Using modprobe to load a kernel module">
<comment>(As an example, we load the pcnet32 kernel)</comment>
# <i>modprobe pcnet32</i>
</pre>

<p>
To check if your network card is now detected, use <c>ifconfig</c>. A
detected network card would result in something like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Testing availability of your network card, succesfull">
# <i>ifconfig eth0</i>
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr FE:FD:00:00:00:00  
          BROADCAST NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
</pre>

<p>
If however you receive the following error, the network card is not
detected:
</p>

<pre caption="Testing availability of your network card, failed">
# <i>ifconfig eth0</i>
eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
</pre>

<p>
Assuming that you now have a detected network card, you can 
retry <c>net-setup</c> or <c>adsl-setup</c> again (which should work 
now), but for the hardcore people amongst you, we explain how to configure your
network manually.
</p>

<p>
There are two possibilities here. Or you use DHCP (automatic IP retrieval), or
you manually setup your network using the <c>ifconfig</c> and <c>route</c>
commands.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Using DHCP</title>
<body>

<p>
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) makes it possible to
automatically receive networking information (IP address, netmask,
broadcast address, gateway, nameservers etc.). This only works if you
have a DHCP server in your network (or if your provider provides a DHCP
service). To have a network interface receive this information automatically, 
use <c>dhcpcd</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Using dhcpcd">
# <i>dhcpcd eth0</i>
</pre>

<p>
If this works (try pinging some internet server, like <uri
link="http://www.google.com">Google</uri>), then you are all set and
ready to continue. Skip the rest of this section and continue with <uri
link="?part=1&amp;chap=4">Preparing the Disks</uri>.

<subsection>
<title>Understanding Network Terminology</title>
<body>

<note>
If you know your IP address, broadcast address, netmask and nameservers,
then you can skip this subsection and continue with <uri
link="#doc_chap4_sect4">Using ifconfig and route</uri>.
</note>

<p>
If all above fails, you will have to configure your network manually.
Have no fear, it is far from difficult. But we are going to explain a
certain amount of networking to you as you will need it to be able to
configure your network to your satisfaction. When you're done reading this, you
will know what a <e>gateway</e> is, what a <e>netmask</e> serves for,
how a <e>broadcast</e> address is formed and why you need
<e>nameservers</e>.
</p>

<p>
In a network, hosts are identified by their <e>IP address</e> (Internet
Protocol address). Such an address is a combination of four numbers
between 0 and 255. Well, at least that is how we perceive it. In
reality, such an IP address consists of 32 bits (ones and zeros). Let's
view an example:
</p>

<pre caption="Example of an IP address">
IP Address (numbers):   192.168.0.2
IP Address (bits):      11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010
                        -------- -------- -------- --------
                           192      168       0        2
</pre>

<p>
Such an IP address is unique for each host. To be able to make a
distinction between hosts inside a network, and hosts outside a network,
the IP address is divided in two parts: the <e>network</e> part and the
<e>host</e> part. 
</p>

<p>
The seperation is written down with the <e>netmask</e>, a collection of
ones followed by a collection of zeros. The part of the IP that can be
mapped on the ones is the network-part, the other one is the host-part.
As is usual, the netmask can be written down as an IP-address.
</p>

<pre caption="Example of network/host seperation">
IP-address:    192      168      0         2
            11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010
Netmask:    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
               255      255     255        0
           +--------------------------+--------+
                    Network              Host
</pre>

<p>
In other words, 192.168.0.14 is still part of our example network, but
192.168.1.2 is not.
</p>

<p>
The <e>broadcast</e> address is an IP-address with the same network-part
as your network, but with only ones as host-part. Every host on your
network listens to this IP address. It is truely meant for broadcasting
packets.
</p>

<pre caption="Broadcast address">
IP-address:    192      168      0         2
            11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010
Broadcast:  11000000 10101000 00000000 11111111
               192      168      0        255
           +--------------------------+--------+
                     Network             Host
</pre>

<p>
To be able to surf on the internet, you must know which hosts shares the
Internet connection. This host is called the <e>gateway</e>. Since it is
a regular host, it has a regular IP address (for instance 192.168.0.1).
</p>

<p>
We previously stated that every host has its own IP address. To be able
to reach this host by a name (instead of an IP address) you need a
service that translates a name (such as <e>dev.gentoo.org</e>) to an IP
address (such as <e>64.5.62.82</e>). Such a service is called a name
service. To use such a service, you must define the necessary <e>name
servers</e> in <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, your gateway also serves as nameserver. Otherwise you
will have to enter the nameservers provided by your ISP.
</p>

<p>
To summarise, you will need the following information before continuing:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Network Item</th>
  <th>Example</th>

<tr>
  <ti>Your IP address</ti>
  <ti>192.168.0.2</ti>

</tr>
</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Using ifconfig and route</title>
<body>

<p>
Setting up your network consists of three steps. First we assign
ourselves an IP address using <c>ifconfig</c>. Then we setup routing to
the gateway using <c>route</c>. Then we finish up by placing the
nameserver IPs in <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
To assign an IP address, you will need your IP address, broadcast
address and netmask. Then execute the following command, substituting
<c>${IP_ADDR}</c> with your IP address, <c>${BROADCAST}</c> with your
broadcast address and <c>${NETMASK}</c> with your netmask:
</p>

<pre caption="Using ifconfig">
# <i>ifconfig eth0 ${IP_ADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK} up</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now set up routing using <c>route</c>. Substitute <c>${GATEWAY}</c> with
your gateway IP address:
</p>

<pre caption="Using route">
# <i>route add default gw ${GATEWAY}</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now open <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path> with your favorite editor (in our
example, we use <c>nano</c>):
</p>

<pre caption="Creating /etc/resolv.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/resolv.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now fill in your nameserver(s) using the following as a template. Make
sure you substitute <c>${NAMESERVER1}</c> and <c>${NAMESERVER2}</c> with
the appropriate nameserver addresses:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/resolv.conf template">
nameserver ${NAMESERVER1}
nameserver ${NAMESERVER2}
</pre>

<p>
That's it. Now test your network by pinging some Internet server (like
<uri link="http://www.google.com">Google</uri>). If this works,
congratulations then. You are now ready to install Gentoo.
</p>
