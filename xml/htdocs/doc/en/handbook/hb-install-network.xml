<title>Who can do without?</title>
<body>

<p>
Depending on the medium you chose to install Gentoo from, you can or
cannot continue without networking (and Internet). No, we are not
playing with your mind =) 
</p>

<p>
All Gentoo installations can succeed with a working Internet connection.
If you want to install Gentoo without one, you need to use one of the
following installation mediums:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gentoo x86 2-CD Installation LiveCD set (all subarchitectures)</li>
</ul>

<title>Why do I need networking?</title>
<body>

<p>
Installing Gentoo from the Internet results in a fully updated Gentoo
Installation. You'll have an installation based on the most recent
Portage (which is the collection of packages we provide together with
the tools to manage your software). This is also the reason why a
network-installation is preferred. However, some people cannot install
Gentoo from a system attached to the Internet...
</p>

<p>
For those people, some architectures provide a LiveCD with all necessary
sourcecode and tools to install a Gentoo base system (or even beyond).
However, this does come with the price of having not extremely recent
software (although the differences between versions are slim).
</p>

<p>
Some paragraphs above we've explained who can use a networkless
installation. If you do not plan on using the network <e>and</e> you
use one of the listed installation mediums, then you can skip
the rest of this section and continue with the next. Otherwise, continue
with the networking configuration parts below.

<p>
If your system is plugged into an Ethernet network, it is very likely
that your networking configuration has already been set up automatically
for you. If so, you should be able to take advantage of the many
included network-aware commands on the LiveCD such as <c>ssh</c>, <c>scp</c>, 
<c>ping</c>, <c>irssi</c>, <c>wget</c> and <c>links</c>, among others.
</p>

<p>
If networking has been configured for you, the <c>/sbin/ifconfig</c> command
should list some network interfaces besides lo, such as eth0:
</p>

<pre caption="/sbin/ifconfig for a working network card">
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:50:BA:8F:61:7A
          inet addr:192.168.0.2  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

<title>Testing the Network</title>
<body>

<p>
You may want to try pinging your ISP's DNS server (found in
<path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>) and a Web site of choice, just to make sure 
that your packets are reaching the net, DNS name resolution is working 
correctly, etc..
</p>

<pre caption="Further network testing">
# <i>ping -c 3 www.yahoo.com</i>
</pre>

<p>
Are you able to use your network? If so, you can skip the rest of this
section. If not, bad luck, you'll have to persue a bit harder :)

<title>Alternative: Automatic Network Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The simplest way to set up networking if it didn't get configured
automatically is to run the <c>net-setup</c> script:
</p>

<pre caption="Running the net-setup script">
# <i>net-setup eth0</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now test your network as we described above. Still no luck? Well then
it's time to manually configure the network. Otherwise continue with the
next section.

<title>Understanding Network Terminology</title>

<p>
If all above fails, you will have to configure your network manually.
Have no fear, it is far from difficult. But we are going to explain a
certain amount of networking to you as you will need it to be able to
configure your network satisfactory. When you're done reading this, you
will know what a <e>gateway</e> is, what a <e>netmask</e> serves for and
how a <e>broadcast</e> address is formed.
</p>

<p>
In a network, hosts are identified by their <e>IP address</e> (Internet
Protocol address). Such an address is a combination of four numbers
between 0 and 255. Well, at least that is how we perceive it. In
reality, such an IP address consists of 32 bits (ones and zeros). Lets
view an example:
</p>

<pre caption="Example of an IP address">
IP Address (numbers):   192.168.0.2
IP Address (bits):      11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010
                        -------- -------- -------- --------
                           192      168       0        2
</pre>

<p>
Such an IP address ...
