<title>Timezone</title>
<body>

<p>
You first need to select your timezone so that your system knows where it is
located. Look for your timezone in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>, then copy
it to <path>/etc/localtime</path>. Please avoid the
<path>/usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT*</path> timezones as their names do not
indicate the expected zones. For instance, <path>GMT-8</path> is in fact GMT+8.
</p>

<title>Choosing a Kernel</title>
<body>

<p>
The core around which all distributions are built is the Linux kernel. It is the
layer between the user programs and your system hardware. Gentoo provides its
users several possible kernel sources. A full listing with description is
available at the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-kernel.xml">Gentoo Kernel
Guide</uri>. 
</p>

<p>
For x86-based systems we have, amongst other kernels, <c>vanilla-sources</c>
(the default kernel source as developed by the linux-kernel developers),
<c>gentoo-sources</c> (kernel source patched with performance-enhancing
features), ...
</p>

<p>
Choose your kernel source and install it using <c>emerge</c>. 
The <c>USE="-doc"</c> is necessary to avoid installing xorg-x11 or other
dependencies at this point:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing a kernel source">
# <i>USE="-doc" emerge gentoo-sources</i>
</pre>

<p>
When you take a look in <path>/usr/src</path> you should see a symlink called
<path>linux</path> pointing to your kernel source. We will assume the kernel
source installed is <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.12-r10</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the kernel source symlink">
# <i>ls -l /usr/src/linux</i>
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root      12 Oct 13 11:04 /usr/src/linux -&gt; linux-2.6.12-gentoo-r10
</pre>

<p>
If the symlink doesn't point to the kernel source of your choice (note that
<c>linux-2.6.12-gentoo-r10</c> is merely an example) you should change it to the
right kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the kernel source symlink">
# <i>rm /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>cd /usr/src</i>
# <i>ln -s linux-2.6.12-gentoo-r10 linux</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now it is time to configure and compile your kernel source. You 
can use <c>genkernel</c> for this, which will build a generic kernel as used 
by the Installation CD. We explain the "manual" configuration first though, as 
it is the best way to optimize your environment.
</p>

<p>
If you want to manually configure your kernel, continue now with <uri
link="#manual">Default: Manual Configuration</uri>. If you want to use 
<c>genkernel</c> you should read <uri link="#genkernel">Alternative: Using 
genkernel</uri> instead.

<title>Default: Manual Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Manually configuring a kernel is often seen as the most difficult procedure a
Linux user ever has to perform. Nothing is less true -- after configuring a
couple of kernels you don't even remember that it was difficult ;)
</p>

<p>
However, one thing <e>is</e> true: you must know your system when you start
configuring a kernel manually. Most information can be gathered by emerging 
pciutils (<c>emerge pciutils</c>) which contains <c>lspci</c>. You will now 
be able to  use <c>lspci</c> within the chrooted environment. You may safely 
ignore any <e>pcilib</e> warnings (like pcilib: cannot open 
/sys/bus/pci/devices) that <c>lspci</c> throws out. Alternatively, you can run 
<c>lspci</c> from a <e>non-chrooted</e> environment. The results are the same. 
You can also run <c>lsmod</c> to see what kernel modules the Installation CD 
uses (it might provide you with a nice hint on what to enable).
</p>

<p>
Now go to your kernel source directory and execute <c>make menuconfig</c>. This
will fire up an ncurses-based configuration menu.
</p>

<pre caption="Invoking menuconfig">
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted with several configuration sections. We'll first list some
options you must activate (otherwise Gentoo will not function, or not function
properly without additional tweaks).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Activating Required Options</title>
<body>

<p>
First of all, activate the use of development and experimental code/drivers.
You need this, otherwise some very important code/drivers won't show up:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting experimental code/drivers, General setup">
Code maturity level options ---&gt;
  [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
General setup  ---&gt;
  [*] Support for hot-pluggable devices
</pre>

<p>
Make sure that every driver that is vital to the booting of your system (such as
SCSI controller, ...) is compiled <e>in</e> the kernel and not as a module,
otherwise your system will not be able to boot completely.
</p>

<p>
Now select the correct processor family:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting correct processor family">
Processor type and features ---&gt;
  <comment>(Change according to your system)</comment>
  (<i>Athlon/Duron/K7</i>) Processor family
</pre>

<p>
Now go to <c>File Systems</c> and select support for the filesystems you use.
<e>Don't</e> compile them as modules, otherwise your Gentoo system will not be
able to mount your partitions. Also select <c>Virtual memory</c> and <c>/proc
file system</c>. If you are using a 2.6 kernel (default), do <e>not</e> select
the <c>/dev file system</c>, Gentoo/x86 uses <c>udev</c> by default now. If you
are using a 2.4 kernel, you still need to select <c>/dev file system</c> though
as 2.4 kernels do not support <c>udev</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting necessary file systems">
<comment>(With a 2.4.x kernel)</comment>
File systems ---&gt;
  [*] Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
  [*] /proc file system support

  &lt;*&gt; Ext3 journalling file system support
  &lt;*&gt; JFS filesystem support
  &lt;*&gt; Second extended fs support
  &lt;*&gt; XFS filesystem support
</pre>

<p>
If your BIOS can't handle large harddrives and you jumpered the harddrive to
report a limited size you have to enable the following option to gain access
to your whole harddrive:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting autogeometry resizing support">
<comment>(2.4.x kernel only)</comment>
ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support ---&gt;
  IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices ---&gt;
    &lt;*&gt;   Include IDE/ATA-2 DISK support
    [ ]     Use multi-mode by default
    [*]     Auto-Geometry Resizing support
</pre>

<p>
Do not forget to enable DMA for your drives:
</p>

<pre caption="Activating DMA">
Device Drivers ---&gt;
  ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support ---&gt;
    [*] Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
    [*]   Use PCI DMA by default when available
</pre>

<p>
If you are using PPPoE to connect to the Internet or you are using a dial-up
modem, you will need the following options in the kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting PPPoE necessary drivers">
<comment>(With a 2.4.x kernel)</comment>
Network device support ---&gt;
  &lt;*&gt; PPP (point-to-point protocol) support

</pre>

<p>
The two compression options won't harm but are not definitely needed, neither
does the <c>PPP over Ethernet</c> option, that might only be used by 
<c>rp-pppoe</c> when configured to do kernel mode PPPoE.
</p>

<p>
If you require it, don't forget to include support in the kernel for your
ethernet card.
</p>

<p>
If you have an Intel CPU that supports HyperThreading (tm), or you have a
multi-CPU system, you should activate "Symmetric multi-processing support":
</p>

<pre caption="Activating SMP support">
Processor type and features  ---&gt;
  [*] Symmetric multi-processing support

<p>
If you use USB Input Devices (like Keyboard or Mouse) don't forget to enable
those as well:
</p>

<pre caption="Activating USB Support for Input Devices">

<p>
Laptop-users who want PCMCIA support should <e>not</e> use the PCMCIA drivers if
they choose to use a 2.4 kernel. More recent drivers are available through the
<c>pcmcia-cs</c> package which will be installed later on. 2.6-kernel users
however should use the PCMCIA drivers from the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Besides compiling in PCMCIA support in the 2.6 kernel, don't forget to enable
support for the PCMCIA card bridge present in your system:
</p>

<pre caption="Enabling PCMCIA support for 2.6 kernels">

When you've finished configuring the kernel, continue with <uri

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured, it is time to compile and install it. Exit 
the configuration and start the compilation process:
</p>

<pre caption="Compiling the kernel">
<comment>(For 2.4 kernel)</comment>
# <i>make dep &amp;&amp; make bzImage modules modules_install</i>

<comment>(For 2.6 kernel)</comment>
# <i>make &amp;&amp; make modules_install</i>
</pre>

<p>
When the kernel has finished compiling, copy the kernel image to
<path>/boot</path>. From here onwards we assume that the kernel you are
installing is the 2.6.12-r10 version of the <c>gentoo-sources</c>. Use whatever 
name you feel is appropriate for your choice and remember it as you will need it
later on when you configure your bootloader.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing the kernel">
# <i>cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-2.6.12-gentoo-r10</i>
</pre>

<p>
It is also wise to copy over your kernel configuration file to
<path>/boot</path>, just in case :)
</p>

<pre caption="Backing up your kernel configuration">
# <i>cp .config /boot/config-2.6.12-gentoo-r10</i>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#kernel_modules">Kernel Modules</uri>.

<section id="genkernel">
<title>Alternative: Using genkernel</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are reading this section, you have chosen to use our <c>genkernel</c>
script to configure your kernel for you.
</p>

<p>
Now that your kernel source tree is installed, it's now time to compile your 
kernel by using our <c>genkernel</c> script to automatically build a kernel for 
you. <c>genkernel</c> works by configuring a kernel nearly identically to the 
way our Installation CD kernel is configured. This means that when you use 
<c>genkernel</c> to build your kernel, your system will generally detect all 
your hardware at boot-time, just like our Installation CD does. Because 
genkernel doesn't require any manual kernel configuration, it is an ideal 
solution for those users who may not be comfortable compiling their own kernels.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's see how to use genkernel. First, emerge the genkernel ebuild:
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging genkernel">
# <i>emerge genkernel</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, if you are going to configure a 2.6 kernel, copy over the kernel 
configuration used by the Installation CD to the location where genkernel 
looks for the default kernel configuration:
</p>

<pre caption="Copying over the Installation CD kernel config">
<comment>(Only do this if you are going to configure a 2.6 kernel)</comment>
# <i>zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; /usr/share/genkernel/x86/kernel-config-2.6</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now, compile your kernel sources by running <c>genkernel all</c>. Be aware
though, as <c>genkernel</c> compiles a kernel that supports almost all
hardware, this compilation will take quite a while to finish!
</p>

<p>
Note that, if your boot partition doesn't use ext2 or ext3 as filesystem you
might need to manually configure your kernel using <c>genkernel --menuconfig 
all</c> and add support for your filesystem <e>in</e> the kernel (i.e. 
<e>not</e> as a module). Users of EVMS2 or LVM2 will probably want to add
<c>--evms2</c> or <c>--lvm2</c> as argument as well.
</p>

<pre caption="Running genkernel">
# <i>genkernel all</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once <c>genkernel</c> completes, a kernel, full set of modules and 
<e>initial root disk</e> (initrd) will be created. We will use the kernel 
and initrd when configuring a boot loader later in this document. Write
down the names of the kernel and initrd as you will need it when writing
the bootloader configuration file. The initrd will be started immediately after 
booting to perform hardware autodetection (just like on the Installation CD)
before your "real" system starts up.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the created kernel image name and initrd">
# <i>ls /boot/kernel* /boot/initramfs*</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now, let's perform one more step to get our system to be more like the
Installation CD -- let's emerge <c>coldplug</c>. While the initrd autodetects 
hardware that is needed to boot your system, <c>coldplug</c> autodetects 
everything else. To emerge and enable <c>coldplug</c>, type the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging and enabling coldplug">
# <i>emerge coldplug</i>
# <i>rc-update add coldplug boot</i>
</pre>

<section id="kernel_modules">
<title>Kernel Modules</title>
<subsection>
<title>Configuring the Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
You should list the modules you want automatically loaded in 
<path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4</path> (or <path>kernel-2.6</path>). 
You can add extra options to the modules too if you want.
</p>

<p>
To view all available modules, run the following <c>find</c> command. Don't
forget to substitute "&lt;kernel version&gt;" with the version of the kernel you
just compiled:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing all available modules">
# <i>find /lib/modules/&lt;kernel version&gt;/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko'</i>
</pre>

<p>
For instance, to automatically load the <c>3c59x.o</c> module, edit the
<path>kernel-2.4</path> or <path>kernel-2.6</path> file and enter the module
name in it.
</p>

<pre caption="Editing /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4">
