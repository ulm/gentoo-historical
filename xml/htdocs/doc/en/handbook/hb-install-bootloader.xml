<title>Making your Choice</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured and compiled and the necessary system
configuration files are filled in correctly, it is time to install a
program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Such a
program is called a <e>bootloader</e>. But before you start, consider
your options...
</p>

<p>
Several bootloaders exist for Linux. However, these bootloaders only
function on a small set of architectures. Therefor you must choose between the
bootloaders that support your architecture.
</p>

<p>
The next table lists the architectures and the supported bootloaders.
Pick a bootloader based on your architecture. For instance, if you have
a Pentium IV, then your architecture is <e>x86</e>. You have the choice
between GRUB (recommended) and LILO.
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>Architecture</th><th>Recommended</th><th>Alternatives</th></tr>
 <tr><th>x86</th><ti>GRUB</ti><ti>LILO</ti></tr>
 <tr><th>alpha</th><ti>aBoot</ti><ti>MILO</ti></tr>
 <tr><th>sparc</th><ti>SILO</ti><ti></ti></tr>
 <tr><th>ppc</th><ti>yaBoot (NewWorld), BootX (OldWorld)</ti><ti></ti></tr>
 <tr><th>hppa</th><ti>PALO</ti><ti></ti></tr>
</table>

<title>Framebuffer</title>
<body>

<p>
<e>If</e> you have configured your kernel with framebuffer support, you
have to add a <c>vga</c>-statement to your bootloader configuration
file. The next table lists the available <c>vga</c>-values you can use.
In the example configuration files we use <e>800x600 @ 16bpp</e>, thus
<e>788</e>.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <ti></ti><th>640x480</th><th>800x600</th><th>1024x768</th><th>1280x1024</th>

<title>Default: Using GRUB</title>
<subsection>
<title>Understanding GRUB's terminology</title>
<body>

<warn>
GRUB can only be used with x86-based systems!
</warn>

<p>
The most critical part of understanding GRUB is getting comfortable with
how GRUB refers to hard drives and partitions. Your Linux partition
<path>/dev/hda1</path> is called <path>(hd0,0)</path> under GRUB. Notice the 
parenthesis around the <path>hd0,0</path> - they are required.
</p>

<p>
Hard drives count from zero rather than "a" and partitions start at zero 
rather than one. Be aware too that with the hd devices, only hard drives are 
counted, not atapi-ide devices such as cdrom players and burners.  Also, the 
same construct is used with scsi drives. (Normally they get higher numbers 
than ide drives except when the bios is configured to boot from scsi devices.)
</p>

<p>
Assuming you have a hard drive on <path>/dev/hda</path>, a cdrom player on 
<path>/dev/hdb</path>, a burner on <path>/dev/hdc</path>, a second hard drive 
on <path>/dev/hdd</path> and no SCSI hard drive, <path>/dev/hdd7</path> gets 
translated to <path>(hd1,6)</path>. It might sound tricky and tricky it is 
indeed, but as we will see, GRUB offers a tab completion mechanism
that comes handy for those of you having a lot of hard drives and
partitions and who are a little lost in the GRUB numbering scheme.
</p>

<p>
Having gotten the feel for that, it is time to install GRUB.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Installing GRUB</title>
<body>

<p>
To install GRUB, let's first emerge it:
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing GRUB">
# <i>emerge -k grub</i>
</pre>

<p>
To start configuring GRUB, you type in <c>grub</c>. You'll be presented
with the <path>grub&gt;</path> grub command-line prompt. Now, you need to type 
in the right commands to install the GRUB boot record onto your hard drive.
</p>

<pre caption = "Starting the GRUB shell">
# <i>grub</i>
</pre>

<p>
In the example configuration we want to install GRUB so that it reads its 
information from the boot-partition <path>/dev/hda1</path>, and installs the 
GRUB boot record on the hard drive's MBR (master boot record) so that the first
thing we see when we turn on the computer is the GRUB prompt. Ofcourse, if you
haven't followed the example configuration during the installation,
change the commands accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The tab completion mechanism of GRUB can be used from within GRUB.
For instance, if you type in "<c>root (</c>" followed by a TAB, you will
be presented with a list of devices (such as <path>hd0</path>). If you
type in "<c>root (hd0,</c>" followed by a TAB, you will receive a list
of available partitions to choose from (such as <path>hd0,0</path>).
</p>

<p>
By using the tab completion, setting up GRUB should be not that hard.
Now go on, configure GRUB, shall we? :-)
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing GRUB in the MBR">
grub&gt; <i>root (hd0,0)</i>          <comment>(Use information from the boot partition)</comment>
grub&gt; <i>setup (hd0)</i>           <comment>(Install GRUB in the MBR)</comment>
grub&gt; <i>quit</i>                  <comment>(Exit the GRUB shell)</comment>
</pre>

<note>
If you want to install GRUB in a certain partition instead of the MBR,
you have to alter the <c>setup</c> command so it points to the right
partition. For instance, if you want GRUB installed in
<path>/dev/hda3</path>, then the command becomes <c>setup (hd0,2)</c>.
Few users however want to do this.
</note>

<p>
Although GRUB is now installed, we still need to write up a
configuration file for it, so that GRUB automatically boots your newly
created kernel. Create <path>/boot/grub/grub.conf</path> with
<c>nano</c> (or, if applicable, another editor):
</p>

<pre caption = "Creating /boot/grub/grub.conf">
# <i>nano -w /boot/grub/grub.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we are going to write up a <path>grub.conf</path>. Beneath you'll
find a <path>grub.conf</path> for the partitioning example we use in
this guide, with kernel image <path>kernel-2.4.22-gentoo-r2</path>.
</p>

<pre caption = "grub.conf content">
default 0                               <comment># Which listing to boot default. 0 is the first, 1 the second etc.</comment>
timeout 30                              <comment># How many seconds to wait before the default listing is booted.</comment>        
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz  <comment># Nice, fat splash-image to spice things up :)</comment>

title=Gentoo Linux
root (hd0,0)                            <comment># Partition where the kernel image (or operating system) is located</comment>
kernel (hd0,0)/kernel-2.4.22-gentoo-r2 root=/dev/hda3
<comment># Only if you use genkernel. Otherwise remove the following line:</comment>
initrd (hd0,0)/initrd-2.4.22-gentoo-r2

<comment># The next three lines are only if you dualboot with a Windows system.</comment>
<comment># In this case, Windows is hosted on /dev/hda6.</comment>
title=Windows XP
root (hd0,5)
chainloader (hd0,5) +1
</pre>

<note>
If you use a different partitioning scheme and/or kernel image, adjust 
accordingly. However, make sure that anything that follows a GRUB-device 
(such as <path>(hd0,0)</path>) is relative to the mountpoint, not the root. In 
other words, <path>(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz</path> is in reality 
<path>/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz</path> since <path>(hd0,0)</path> is 
<path>/boot</path>.
</note>

<p>
If you need to pass any additional options to the kernel, simply add
them to the end of the kernel command. We're already passing one option
(<c>root=/dev/hda3</c>), but you can pass others as well. As an example
we use the <c>vga</c> statement for framebuffer we discussed previously:
</p>

<pre caption = "Adding the vga-statement as a kernel option">
title=Gentoo Linux
  root (hd0,0)
  kernel (hd0,0)/kernel-2.4.22-gentoo-r2 root=/dev/hda3 vga=788
</pre>

<p>
Now save the <path>grub.conf</path> file and exit. As of now, GRUB is
fully configured, and you can continue with configuring the rest of the
system.
</p>

<title>Alternative: Using LILO</title>
<subsection>
<title>Installing LILO</title>
<body>

<warn>
LILO can only be used with x86-based systems!
</warn>

<p>
LILO, the LInuxLOader, is the tried and true workhorse of Linux
bootloaders. However, it lacks some features that GRUB has (which is
also the reason why GRUB is currently gaining popularity). The reason
why LILO is still used is that, on some systems, GRUB doesn't work and
LILO does. Ofcourse, it is also used because some people know LILO and
want to stick with it. Either way, Gentoo supports both, and apparently
you have chosen to use LILO.
</p>

<p>
Installing LILO is a breeze; just use <c>emerge</c>.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing LILO">
# <i>emerge -k lilo</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Configuring LILO</title>
<body>

<p>
To configure LILO, you must create <path>/etc/lilo.conf</path>. Fire up
your favorite editor (in this handbook we use <c>nano</c> for
consistency) and create the file.
</p>

<pre caption = "Creating /etc/lilo.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/lilo.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Some sections ago we have asked you to remember the kernel-image name
you have created. In the next example <path>lilo.conf</path> we assume
the imagename is <path>kernel-2.4.22-gentoo-r2</path>. We also use the
example partitioning scheme in this example.
</p>

<pre caption = "Example /etc/lilo.conf">
boot=/dev/hda             <comment># Install LILO in the MBR</comment>
prompt                    <comment># Give the user the chance to select another section</comment>
timeout=50                <comment># Wait 5 (five) seconds before booting the default section</comment>
default=gentoo            <comment># When the timeout has passed, boot the "gentoo" section</comment>
<comment># Only if you use framebuffer. Otherwise remove the following line:</comment>
vga=788                   <comment># Framebuffer setting. Adjust to your own will</comment>

image=/boot/kernel-2.4.22-gentoo-r2
  label=gentoo            <comment># Name we give to this section</comment>
  read-only               <comment># Start with a read-only root. Do not alter!</comment>
  root=/dev/hda3          <comment># Location of the root filesystem</comment>
  <comment># Only if you use genkernel. Otherwise remove the following line:</comment>
  initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.22-gentoo-r2

<comment># The next two lines are only if you dualboot with a Windows system.</comment>
<comment># In this case, Windows is hosted on /dev/hda6.</comment>
other=/dev/hda6
  label=windows
</pre>

<note>
If you use a different partitioning scheme and/or kernel image, adjust
accordingly.
</note>

<p>
If you need to pass any additional options to the kernel, add an
<c>append</c> statement to the section. As an example, we add the
<c>resume</c> statement for software suspend:
</p>

<pre caption = "Using append to add kernel options">
image=/boot/kernel-2.4.22-gentoo-r2
  label=gentoo
  read-only
  root=/dev/hda3
  <i>append="resume=/dev/hda2"</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now save the file and exit. To finish up, you have to run
<c>/sbin/lilo</c> so LILO can apply the <path>/etc/lilo.conf</path> to
your system (i.e. install itself on the disk).
</p>

<pre caption = "Finishing the LILO installation">
# <i>/sbin/lilo</i>

<title>Alternative: Using aboot</title>
<body>

<warn>
aboot can only be used with alpha-based systems!
</warn>

<p>
We first install aboot on our system. Ofcourse we use <c>emerge</c> to
do so:
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing aboot">
# <i>emerge -k aboot</i>
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to make our bootdisk bootable. This will start
<c>aboot</c> when you boot your system. We make our bootdisk bootable by
writing the <c>aboot</c> bootloader to the start of the disk.
</p>

<pre caption = "Making your bootdisk bootable">
# <i>swriteboot -f3 /dev/sda /boot/bootlx</i> 
# <i>abootconf /dev/sda 2</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you use a different partitioning scheme than the one we use
throughout this chapter, you have to change the commands accordingly.
Please read the appropriate manual pages (<c>man 8 swriteboot</c> and
<c>man 8 abootconf</c>).
</note>

<p>
Additionally, you can make Gentoo boot more easily by setting up the
aboot configuration file and SRM boot_osflags variable. You will need to
make sure that the bootdef_dev is also properly set (easier to do at the
console than from Linux).
</p>

<pre caption = "Improve booting Gentoo">
# <i>echo '0:2/boot/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda2' &gt; /etc/aboot.conf</i>
# <i>echo -n 0 &gt; /proc/srm_environment/named_variables/boot_osflags</i>
# <i>echo -n '' &gt; /proc/srm_environment/named_variables/boot_file</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you're installing using a serial console, don't forget to include
the serial console boot flag in <path>aboot.conf</path>. See 
<path>/etc/aboot.conf.example</path> for some further information. 
Additionally, you need to allow login on the serial port:
</p>

<pre caption = "Allowing login on the serial port">
# <i>echo tts/0 &gt;&gt; /etc/securetty</i>
# <i>echo 's0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 tts/0 vt100' &gt;&gt; /etc/inittab</i>

<title>Alternative: Using MILO</title>
<body>

<warn>
MILO can only be used with alpha-based systems!
</warn>

<p>
Before continuing, you should decide on how to use MILO. In this
section, we will assume that you want to make a MILO boot floppy. If you
are going to boot from an MS-DOS partition on your hard disk, you should
amend the commands appropriately.
</p>

<p>
To install MILO, we use <c>emerge</c>.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing MILO">
# <i>emerge -k milo</i>
</pre>

<p>
After MILO has been installed, the MILO images should be in
<path>/opt/milo</path>. The commands below make a bootfloppy for use
with MILO. Remember to use the correct image for your Alpha-system.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing MILO on a floppy">
<comment>(First insert a blank floppy)</comment>
# <i>fdformat /dev/fd0</i>

<comment>)</comment>
# <i>echo -ne '\125\252' | dd of=/dev/fd0 bs=1 seek=510 count=2</i>
</pre>

<p>
Your MILO boot floppy is now ready to boot Gentoo Linux. You may need to
set environment variables in your ARCS Firmware to get MILO to start;
this is all explained in the <uri
link="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MILO-HOWTO/">MILO-HOWTO</uri> with some examples 
on common systems, and examples of the commands to use in interactive mode.
</p>

<p>
Not reading the <uri link="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MILO-HOWTO/">MILO-HOWTO</uri>

<pre caption = "Creating /etc/silo.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/silo.conf</i>

<title>Alternative: Using PALO</title>
<body>

<warn>
PALO can only be used on HPPA-based systems!
</warn>

<p>
On the PA-RISC platform, the boot loader is called palo. You can find
the configuration file in <path>/etc/palo.conf</path>. Here is a sample 
configuration:
</p>

<pre caption = "/etc/palo.conf example">
--commandline=2/vmlinux root=/dev/sdb2 HOME=/
--recoverykernel=/vmlinux.old
--init-partitioned=/dev/sdb
</pre>

<p>
The first line tells palo the location of the kernel and which boot
parameters it must use. <c>2/vmlinux</c> means the kernel named <c>/vmlinux</c>
resides on the second partition. Beware, the path to the kernel is
relative to the partition, not to the root of your filesystem.
</p>

<p>
The second line indicates which recovery kernel to use. If it is your
first install and you do not have a recovery kernel, please comment this
out. The third line indicates on which disk palo will reside. 
</p>

<p>
When configuration is done, just run <c>palo</c>.

<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<warn>
yaBoot can only be used on NewWorld PPC-based systems!
</warn>

<p>
There are two ways to configure yaBoot for your system. You can use the
new and improved <c>yabootconfig</c> included with
<path>yaboot-1.3.8-r1</path> and later to automatically setup yaboot. If
for some reason you do not want to run <c>yabootconfig</c> to
automatically setup <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path>, you can just edit the
sample file already installed on your system.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Default: Using yabootconfig</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>yabootconfig</c> will auto-detect the partitions on your machine and will
setup dual and triple boot combinations with Linux, Mac OS, and Mac OS
X.
</p>

<p>
To use <c>yabootconfig</c>, your drive must have a bootstrap partition, and
<path>/etc/fstab</path> must be configured with your Linux partitions. Both of 
these should have been done already in the steps above. To start, ensure that
you have the latest version of yaboot installed by running <c>emerge -u
yaboot</c>. This is necessary as the latest version will be available via
Portage, but it may not have made it into the stage files.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing yaboot">
# <i>emerge -ku yaboot</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now run <c>yabootconfig</c>. The program will run and it will confirm
the location of the bootstrap partition. Type <c>Y</c> if it is correct. If
not, double check <path>/etc/fstab</path>. yabootconfig will then scan your
system setup, create <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> and run <c>mkofboot</c> for
you. <c>mkofboot</c> is used to format the bootstrap partition, and install 
the yaboot configuration file into it.
</p>

<p>
You might want to verify the contents of <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path>. If 
you make changes to <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> (like setting the 
default/boot OS), make sure to rerun <c>ybin -v</c> to apply changes to the 
bootstrap partition.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Alternative: Manual yaBoot Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
First make sure you have the latest <c>yaboot</c> installed on your
system:
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing yaboot">

<p>
Once <path>yaboot.conf</path> is set up how you want it, you run 
<c>mkofboot -v</c> to install the settings in the bootstrap partition. <e>Don't 
forget this!</e> If all goes well, and you have the same options as the sample 
above, your next reboot will give you a simple, five-entry boot menu. If you 
update your yaboot config later on, you'll just need to run <c>ybin -v</c> to 
update the bootstrap partition - <c>mkofboot</c> is for initial setup only.
