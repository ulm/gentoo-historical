<p>
If you and your computer are always on the move, you may not always have an
ethernet cable or plugged in or an access point available. Also, we may want
networking to automatically work when an ethernet cable is plugged in or an
access point is found.

Here you can find some tools that helps you manage this.

<p>
<uri link="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifplugd/">ifplugd</uri> is a
daemon that starts and stops interfaces when an ethernet cable is inserted or
removed. It can also manage detecting association to Access Points or when new
ones come in range.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing ifplugd">
# <i>emerge sys-apps/ifplugd</i>
</pre>

<p>
Configuration for ifplugd is fairly straightforward too. The configuration file
is held in <path>/etc/conf.d/ifplugd</path>. Run <c>man ifplugd</c> for details
on what the variables do.
