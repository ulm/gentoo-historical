<p>
You first need to select your timezone so that your system knows where it is
located. Look for your timezone in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>, then make a
symlink to <path>/etc/localtime</path> using <c>ln</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the timezone information">
# <i>ls /usr/share/zoneinfo</i>
<comment>(Suppose you want to use GMT)</comment>
# <i>ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT /etc/localtime</i>

<subsection>
<title>Choosing a Kernel</title>
<body>

<p>
The core around which all distributions are built is the Linux kernel. It is the
layer between the user programs and your system hardware. Gentoo provides its
users several possible kernel sources. A full listing with description is
available at the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-kernel.xml">Gentoo Kernel
Guide</uri>. 
</p>

<p>
For PPC you can choose between <c>vanilla-sources</c> and
<c>gentoo-sources</c> (both 2.6 kernels). The latter is available when you
perform a networkless installation.  Beside those there is a special
kernel-2.6-patchset for the Pegasos: <c>pegasos-sources</c>.  So let's
continue with <c>emerge</c>'ing the kernel sources:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing a kernel source">
# <i>emerge gentoo-sources</i>
</pre>

<note>
The PowerPC sources are based on a 2.6.10-kernel with security patches from
2.6.11 backported.  As the time of the release the 2.6.11 kernel produced
several problems on different PowerPC machines.
</note>

<p>
When you take a look in <path>/usr/src</path> you should see a symlink called
<path>linux</path> pointing to your kernel source. We will assume the kernel
source installed is <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.10-r8</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the kernel source symlink">
# <i>ls -l /usr/src/linux</i>
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           22  Mar 18 16:23 /usr/src/linux -&gt; linux-2.6.10-gentoo-r8
</pre>

<p>
If the symlink doesn't point to the kernel source of your choice (note that
<c>linux-2.6.10-gentoo-r8</c> is merely an example) you should change it to the
right kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the kernel source symlink">
# <i>rm /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>cd /usr/src</i>
# <i>ln -s linux-2.6.10-gentoo-r8 linux</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now it is time to configure and compile your kernel source. You 
can use <c>genkernel</c> for this, which will build a generic kernel as used 
by the Installation CD. We explain the "manual" configuration first though, as
it is the best way to optimize your environment.
</p>

<p>
If you want to manually configure your kernel, continue now with <uri
link="#manual">Default: Manual Configuration</uri>. If you want to use 
<c>genkernel</c> you should read <uri link="#genkernel">Alternative: Using 
genkernel</uri> instead.

<title>Default: Manual Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Manually configuring a kernel is often seen as the most difficult procedure a
Linux user ever has to perform. Nothing is less true -- after configuring a
couple of kernels you don't even remember that it was difficult ;)
</p>

<p>
However, one thing <e>is</e> true: you must know your system when you start
configuring a kernel manually. Most information can be gathered by emerging 
pciutils (<c>emerge pciutils</c>) which contains <c>lspci</c>. You will now 
be able to  use <c>lspci</c> within the chrooted environment. You may safely 
ignore any <e>pcilib</e> warnings (like pcilib: cannot open 
/sys/bus/pci/devices) that <c>lspci</c> throws out. Alternatively, you can run 
<c>lspci</c> from a <e>non-chrooted</e> environment. The results are the same. 
You can also run <c>lsmod</c> to see what kernel modules the Installation CD 
uses (it might provide you with a nice hint on what to enable).
</p>

<p>
Now go to your kernel source directory and execute <c>make menuconfig</c>. This
will fire up an ncurses-based configuration menu.
</p>

<pre caption="Invoking menuconfig">
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted with several configuration sections. We'll first list some
options you must activate (otherwise Gentoo will not function, or not function
properly without additional tweaks).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Activating Required Options</title>
<body>

<p>
First of all, activate the use of development and experimental code/drivers.
You need this, otherwise some very important code/drivers won't show up:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting experimental code/drivers, General setup">
Code maturity level options ---&gt;
  [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
General setup --->
  [*] Support for hot-pluggable devices
</pre>

<p>
Now go to <c>File Systems</c> and select support for the filesystems you use.
<e>Don't</e> compile them as modules, otherwise your Gentoo system will not be
able to mount your partitions. Also select <c>/proc file system</c> and
<c>Virtual memory</c>. Do <e>not</e> select the <c>/dev file system</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting necessary file systems">
File systems ---&gt;
  Pseudo Filesystems ---&gt;
    [*] /proc file system support
    [ ] /dev file system support (OBSOLETE)
    [*] Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)

<comment>(Select one or more of the following options as needed by your system)</comment>
  &lt;*&gt; Reiserfs support
  &lt;*&gt; Ext3 journalling file system support
  &lt;*&gt; Second extended fs support
  &lt;*&gt; XFS filesystem support
</pre>

<p>
If you are using PPPoE to connect to the Internet or you are using a dial-up
modem, you will need the following options in the kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting PPPoE necessary drivers">
Device Drivers ---&gt;
  Networking support ---&gt;
    &lt;*&gt; PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
    &lt;*&gt;   PPP support for async serial ports
    &lt;*&gt;   PPP support for sync tty ports
</pre>

<p>
The two compression options won't harm but are not definitely needed, neither
does the <c>PPP over Ethernet</c> option, that might only be used by 
<c>rp-pppoe</c> when configured to do kernel mode PPPoE.
</p>

<p>
If you require it, don't forget to include support in the kernel for your
ethernet card.
</p>

<p>
Disable ADB raw keycodes:
</p>

<pre caption="Disabling ADB raw keycodes">
Macintosh Device Drivers ---&gt;
  [ ] Support for ADB raw keycodes
</pre>

<p>
Also choose the correct RTC support (<e>disable</e> the <c>Enhanced RTC</c> 
option):
</p>

<pre caption="Activating the correct RTC option">
Character devices ---&gt;
  [ ] Enhanced RTC

General setup ---&gt;
  [*] Support for /dev/rtc
</pre>

<p>
Users of OldWorld machines will want HFS support so they can copy compiled
kernels to the MacOS partition.  This applies also to NewWorld machines as it is
needed for the special Apple_Bootstrap partition:
</p>

<pre caption="Activating HFS support">

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured, it is time to compile and install it. Exit 
the configuration and run the commands which will compile the kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Compiling the kernel">
# <i>make all &amp;&amp; make modules_install</i>
</pre>

<p>
When the kernel has finished compiling, copy the kernel image to
<path>/boot</path> (be sure that it is mounted properly on the Pegasos).
</p>

<pre caption="Installing the kernel">
<comment>replace 2.6.10 with your kernel-version</comment>
(Apple/IBM)  # <i>cp vmlinux /boot/kernel-2.6.10</i>
(Pegasos)    # <i>cp arch/ppc/boot/images/zImage.chrp /boot/kernel-2.6.10</i>
</pre>

<p>
It is also wise to copy over your kernel configuration file to
<path>/boot</path>, just in case :)
</p>

<pre caption="Backing up your kernel configuration">
# <i>cp .config /boot/config-2.6.10-gentoo-r8</i>

<title>Configuring the Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
You should list the modules you want automatically loaded in 
<path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path>. 
You can add extra options to the modules too if you want.
</p>

<p>
To view all available modules, run the following <c>find</c> command. Don't
forget to substitute "&lt;kernel version&gt;" with the version of the kernel you
just compiled:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing all available modules">
# <i>find /lib/modules/&lt;kernel version&gt;/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko'</i>
</pre>

<p>
For instance, to automatically load the <c>3c59x.o</c> module, edit the
<path>kernel-2.6</path> file and enter the module
name in it.
</p>

<pre caption="Editing /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6">
# <i>nano -w /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6">

<section id="genkernel">
<title>Alternative: Using genkernel</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are reading this section, you have chosen to use our <c>genkernel</c>
script to configure your kernel for you.
</p>

<p>
Now that your kernel source tree is installed, it's now time to compile your 
kernel by using our <c>genkernel</c> script to automatically build a kernel for 
you. <c>genkernel</c> works by configuring a kernel nearly identically to the 
way our Installation CD kernel is configured. This means that when you use 
<c>genkernel</c> to build your kernel, your system will generally detect all 
your hardware at boot-time, just like our Installation CD does. Because genkernel 
doesn't require any manual kernel configuration, it is an ideal solution for 
those users who may not be comfortable compiling their own kernels.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's see how to use genkernel. First, emerge the genkernel ebuild:
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging genkernel">
# <i>emerge genkernel</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, copy over the kernel configuration used by the Installation CD to the 
location where genkernel looks for the default kernel configuration:
</p>

<pre caption="Copying over the Installation CD kernel config">
# <i>zcat /proc/config.gz > /usr/share/genkernel/ppc/kernel-config-2.6</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now, compile your kernel sources by running <c>genkernel --udev all</c>.
Be aware though, as <c>genkernel</c> compiles a kernel that supports almost all 
hardware, this compilation will take quite a while to finish!
</p>

<p>
Note that, if your partition where the kernel should be located doesn't use ext2
or ext3 as filesystem you might need to manually configure your kernel using
<c>genkernel --menuconfig all</c> and add support for your filesystem <e>in</e>
the kernel (i.e. <e>not</e> as a module). Users of EVMS2 or LVM2 will probably
want to add <c>--evms2</c> or <c>--lvm2</c> as argument as well.
</p>

<pre caption="Running genkernel">
# <i>genkernel --udev all</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once <c>genkernel</c> completes, a kernel, full set of modules and 
<e>initial root disk</e> (initrd) will be created. We will use the kernel 
and initrd when configuring a boot loader later in this document. Write
down the names of the kernel and initrd as you will need it when writing
the bootloader configuration file. The initrd will be started immediately after 
booting to perform hardware autodetection (just like on the Installation CD) 
before your "real" system starts up.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the created kernel image name and initrd">
# <i>ls /boot/kernel* /boot/initrd*</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you want your system to be more like the Installation CD you should,
when your Gentoo installation is over, emerge <c>coldplug</c>. While the 
initrd autodetects hardware that is needed to boot your system, 
<c>coldplug</c> autodetects everything else. <c>coldplug</c> is available as one
of the packages on the Package CD.
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging and enabling coldplug">
<comment>(Do this after the installation, during the GRP installation instructions)</comment>
# <i>emerge -k coldplug</i>
# <i>rc-update add coldplug boot</i>
</pre>
