<title>The Gentoo Universal Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using a <e>stage3</e> tarball file.
Such a tarball is an archive that contains a minimal environment from
which you can succesfully install Gentoo Linux onto your system.
</p>

<p>
Installations using a stage1 or stage2 tarball file are not documented in the
Gentoo Handbook - please read the <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">Gentoo
FAQ</uri> on these matters.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
An Installation CD is a bootable medium which contains a self-sustained Gentoo 
environment. It allows you to boot Linux from the CD. During the boot process 
your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers are loaded. The Gentoo 
Installation CDs are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
There currently are two Installation CDs available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Universal Installation CD contains everything you need to install 
    Gentoo. It provides stage3 files for common architectures, source code 
    for the extra applications you need to choose from and, of course, the 
    installation instructions for your architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Minimal Installation CD contains only a minimal environment that allows 
    you to boot up and configure your network so you can connect to the 
    Internet. It does not contain any additional files and cannot be used 
    during the current installation approach.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Gentoo also provides a Package CD. This is not an Installation CD but an
additional resource that you can exploit during the installation of your Gentoo
system. It contains prebuilt packages (also known as the GRP set) that allow
you to easily and quickly install additional applications (such as
OpenOffice.org, KDE, GNOME, ...) immediately after the Gentoo installation and
right before you update your Portage tree.
</p>

<p>
The use of the Package CD is covered later in this document. 
</p>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You can download the Universal Installation CD (and, if you want to, the 
Packages CD as well) from one of our <uri 
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located in 
the <path>releases/sparc/2006.1/sparc64/installcd</path> 
directory; the Package CDs are located in the 
<path>releases/sparc/2006.1/sparc64/packagecd</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside those directories you'll find ISO-files. Those are full CD images which
you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
After downloading the file, you can verify its integrity to see if it is
corrupted or not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we
    provide (for instance with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or 
    <uri link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows)
  </li>
  <li>
    You can verify the cryptographic signature that we provide. You need to
    obtain the public key we use (17072058) before you proceed though.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To fetch our public key using the GnuPG application, run the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded
    iso&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
Insert the Gentoo Installation CD in the CD-ROM and boot your system. During 
startup, press Stop-A to enter OpenBootPROM (OBP). Once you are in the OBP, 
boot from the CD-ROM:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting the Installation CD">
ok <i>boot cdrom</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted by the SILO boot manager (on the Installation CD). Type in
<c>2616</c> to use 2.6.16 kernel or <c>2617</c> to use 2.6.17 kernel and press
enter to continue booting the system. <c>2616</c> was tested more extensively
so it's the option you should choose if default <c>2617</c> doesn't work for
you. If you want to have support for the newer Sun boxes (Niagara, UltraSPARC,
T1), you should choose default <c>2617</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Continue booting from the Installation CD">
boot: <i>2617</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once the Installation CD is booted, you will be automatically logged on to the 
system. 
</p>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1. You will also find a root prompt on the serial
console (<path>ttyS0</path>).
</p>

<p>
Continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware Configuration</uri>.
</p>

<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
If not all hardware is supported out-of-the-box, you will need to load the
appropriate kernel modules.
</p>

<p>
In the next example we try to load the <c>8139too</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe 8139too</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook (either from-CD or online) during the
installation, make sure you have created a user account (see <uri
link="#useraccounts">Optional: User Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to
go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>links</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>links /mnt/cdrom/docs/handbook/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD. You can view it using <c>links</c>
as well, but only after having completed the <e>Configuring your Network</e>
chapter (otherwise you won't be able to go on the Internet to view the
document):
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>links http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-sparc.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
