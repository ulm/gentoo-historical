<title>Block Devices</title>

<p>
We'll take a good look at disk-oriented aspects of Gentoo Linux
and Linux in general, including Linux filesystems, partitions and block devices.
Then, once you're familiar with the ins and outs of disks and filesystems,
you'll be guided through the process of setting up partitions and filesystems
for your Gentoo Linux installation.
</p>

<p>
To begin, we'll introduce <e>block devices</e>. The most famous block device is
probably the one that represents the first drive in a Linux system, namely
<path>/dev/sda</path>. SCSI and Serial ATA drives are both labeled
<path>/dev/sd*</path>; even IDE drives are labeled <path>/dev/sd*</path> with
the new libata framework in the kernel. If you're using the old device
framework, then your first IDE drive is <path>/dev/hda</path>.
</p>

<p>
The block devices above represent an abstract interface to the disk. User
programs can use these block devices to interact with your disk without worrying
about whether your drives are IDE, SCSI or something else. The program can
simply address the storage on the disk as a bunch of contiguous,
randomly-accessible 512-byte blocks.
