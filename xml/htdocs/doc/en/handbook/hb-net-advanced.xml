Here we learn about how the configuration works - you need to know this
before we learn about modular networking.

<title>Advanced Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>config_eth0</c> variable is the heart of an interface configuration. It's
a high level instruction list for configuring the interface (<c>eth0</c> in this
case). Each command in the instruction list is performed sequentially. The
interface is deemed OK if at least one command works.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list of built-in instructions.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Command</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>null</c></ti>
  <ti>Do nothing</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>noop</c></ti>
  <ti>
    If the interface is up and there is an address then abort configuration
    successfully
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>an IPv4 or IPv6 address</ti>
  <ti>Add the address to the interface</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>
    <c>dhcp</c>, <c>adsl</c> or <c>apipa</c> (or a custom command from a 3rd
    party module)
  </ti>
  <ti>
    Run the module which provides the command. For example <c>dhcp</c> will run
    a module that provides DHCP which can be one of either <c>dhcpcd</c>,
    <c>dhclient</c> or <c>pump</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If a command fails, you can specify a fallback command. The fallback has to
match the config structure exactly.
</p>

<p>
You can chain these commands together. Here are some real world examples.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuration examples">
<comment># Adding three IPv4 addresses</comment>
config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24
192.168.0.3/24
192.168.0.4/24"

<comment># Adding an IPv4 address and two IPv6 addresses</comment>
config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24

<comment># Keep our kernel assigned address, unless the interface goes
# down so assign another via DHCP. If DHCP fails then add a
# static address determined by APIPA</comment>
config_eth0="noop
dhcp"
fallback_eth0="null
apipa"
</pre>

<note>
When using the <c>ifconfig</c> module and adding more than one address,
interface aliases are created for each extra address. So with the above two
examples you will get interfaces <c>eth0</c>, <c>eth0:1</c> and <c>eth0:2</c>.
You cannot do anything special with these interfaces as the kernel and other
programs will just treat <c>eth0:1</c> and <c>eth0:2</c> as <c>eth0</c>.
</note>

<impo>
The fallback order is important! If we did not specify the <c>null</c> option
then the <c>apipa</c> command would only be run if the <c>noop</c> command
failed.
</impo>

<title>Network Dependencies</title>
<body>

<p>
Init scripts in <path>/etc/init.d</path> can depend on a specific network
interface or just net. All network interfaces in Gentoo's init system provide
what is called <e>net</e>.
</p>

<p>
If, in <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>, <c>rc_depend_strict="YES"</c> is set, then all
network interfaces that provide net must be active before a dependency on "net"
is assumed to be met. In other words, if you have a <path>net.eth0</path> and
<path>net.eth1</path> and an init script depends on "net", then both must be
enabled.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if <c>rc_depend_strict="NO"</c> is set, then the "net"
dependency is marked as resolved the moment at least one network interface is
brought up.
</p>

<p>
But what about <path>net.br0</path> depending on <path>net.eth0</path> and
<path>net.eth1</path>? <path>net.eth1</path> may be a wireless or PPP device
that needs configuration before it can be added to the bridge. This cannot be
done in <path>/etc/init.d/net.br0</path> as that's a symbolic link to
<path>net.lo</path>.
</p>

<p>
The answer is defining an <c>rc_need_</c> setting in
<path>/etc/conf.d/net</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="net.br0 dependency in /etc/conf.d/net">
rc_need_br0="net.eth0 net.eth1"
</pre>

<p>
That alone, however, is not sufficient. Gentoo's networking init scripts use a
virtual dependency called <e>net</e> to inform the system when networking is
available. Clearly, in the above case, networking should only be marked as
available when <path>net.br0</path> is up, not when the others are. So we need
to tell that in <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path> as well:
</p>

<pre caption="Updating virtual dependencies and provisions for networking">
rc_net_lo_provide="!net"
rc_net_eth0_provide="!net"
rc_net_eth1_provide="!net"
</pre>

<p>
For a more detailed discussion about dependency, consult the section <uri
link="?part=2&amp;chap=4#doc_chap4">Writing Init Scripts</uri> in the Gentoo
Handbook. More information about <path>/etc/rc.conf</path> is available as
comments within that file.

<section id="variable_name">
<title>Variable names and values</title>
<body>

<p>
Variable names are dynamic. They normally follow the structure of
<c>variable_${interface|mac|essid|apmac}</c>. For example, the variable
<c>dhcpcd_eth0</c> holds the value for dhcpcd options for eth0 and
<c>dhcpcd_essid</c> holds the value for dhcpcd options when any interface
connects to the ESSID "essid".
</p>

<p>
However, there is no hard and fast rule that states interface names must be
ethx. In fact, many wireless interfaces have names like wlanx, rax as well as 
ethx. Also, some user defined interfaces such as bridges can be given any name,
such as foo. To make life more interesting, wireless Access Points can have 
names with non alpha-numeric characters in them - this is important because 
you can configure networking parameters per ESSID.
</p>

<p>
The downside of all this is that Gentoo uses bash variables for networking -
and bash cannot use anything outside of English alpha-numerics. To get around
this limitation we change every character that is not an English alpha-numeric
into a <c>_</c> character.
</p>

<p>
Another downside of bash is the content of variables - some characters need to
be escaped. This can be achived by placing the <c>\</c> character in front of
the character that needs to be escaped. The following list of characters needs
to be escaped in this way: <c>"</c>, <c>'</c> and  <c>\</c>.
</p>

<p>
In this example we use wireless ESSID as they can contain the widest scope
of characters. We shall use the ESSID <c>My "\ NET</c>:
</p>
