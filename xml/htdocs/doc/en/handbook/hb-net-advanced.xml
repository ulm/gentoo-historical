<title>Advanced Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The config_eth0 variable is the heart of an interface's configuration. It's a
high level instruction list for configuring the interface (eth0 in this case).
Each command in the instruction list is performed sequentially. The interface is
deemed OK if at least one command works.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list of in-built instructions.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Command</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>null</ti>
  <ti>Do nothing</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>noop</ti>
  <ti>
    If the interface is up and there is an address then abort configuration
    successfully
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>an IPv4 or IPv6 address</ti>
  <ti>Add the address to the interface</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>
    dhcp, adsl or apipa (or a custom command from a 3rd party module)
  </ti>
  <ti>
    Run the module which provides the command. For example "dhcp" will run a
    module that provides dhcp which can be one of either dhcpcd, udhcpc,
    dhclient or pump.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If a command fails, you can specify a fallback command. The fallback has to
match the config structure exactly.
</p>

<p>
You can chain these commands together. Here are some real world examples.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuration examples">
<comment># Adding three IPv4 addresses</comment>
config_eth0=(
  "192.168.0.2/24"
  "192.168.0.3/24"
  "192.168.0.4/24"
)

<comment># Adding an IPv4 address and two IPv6 addresses</comment>
config_eth0=(
  "192.168.0.2/24"
  "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab"
  "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ac"
)

<comment># Keep our kernel assigned address, unless the interface goes
# down so assign another via DHCP. If DHCP fails then add a
# static address determined by APIPA</comment>
config_eth0=(
  "noop"
  "dhcp"
)
fallback_eth0=(
  "null"
  "apipa"
)
</pre>

<note>
When using the ifconfig module and adding more than one address, interface
aliases are created for each extra address. So with the above two examples you
will get interfaces eth0, eth0:1 and eth0:2. You cannot do anything special with
these interfaces as the kernel and other programs will just treat eth0:1 and
eth0:2 as eth0.
</note>

<impo>
The fallback order is important! If we did not specify the "null" option then
the "apipa" command would only be run if the "noop" command failed.
</impo>

link="?part=4&amp;chap=3#dhcp">DHCP</uri> are discussed later.

<title>Network Dependencies</title>
<body>

<p>
Init scripts in <path>/etc/init.d</path> can depend on a specific network
interface or just net. "net" can be defined in <path>/etc/conf.d/rc</path> to
mean different things using the <c>RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING</c> variable.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>none</ti>
  <ti>The net service is always considered up</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>no</ti>
  <ti>
    This basically means that at least one net.* service besides net.lo must be
    up.  This can be used by notebook users that have a wifi and a static nic,
    and only wants one up at any given time to have the net service seen as up.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>lo</ti>
  <ti>
    This is the same as the 'no' option, but net.lo is also counted. This should
    be useful to people that do not care about any specific interface being up
    at boot.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>yes</ti>
  <ti>
    For this ALL network interfaces MUST be up for the 'net' service to be
    considered up.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
But what about net.br0 depending on net.eth0 and net.eth1? net.eth1 may be a
wireless or ppp device that needs configuration before it can be added to the
bridge. This cannot be done in <path>/etc/init.d/net.br0</path> as that's a
symbolic link to net.lo
</p>

<p>
The answer is making your own depend() function in <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="net.br0 dependency in /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment># You can use any dependency (use, after, before) as found in current scripts</comment>
depend_br0() {
  need net.eth0 net.eth1
}
</pre>

<p>
For a more detailed discussion about dependency, consult the section <uri
link="?part=2&amp;chap=4#doc_chap4">Writing Init Scripts</uri> in the Gentoo
Handbook.

<section id="variable_name">
<title>Variable names and values</title>
<body>

<p>
Variable names are dynamic. They normally follow the structure of
<c>variable_${interface|mac|essid|apmac}</c>. For example, the variable
<c>dhcpcd_eth0</c> holds the value for dhcpcd options for eth0 and
<c>dhcpcd_essid</c> holds the value for dhcpcd options when any interface
connects to the essid "essid".
</p>

<p>
However, there is no hard and fast rule that states interface names must be
ethx. In fact, many wireless interfaces have names like wlanx, rax as well as 
ethx. Also, some user defined interfaces such as bridges can be given any name,
such as foo. To make life more interesting, wireless Access Points can have 
names with non alpha-numeric characters in them - this is important because 
you can configure networking parameters per ESSID.
</p>

<p>
The downside of all this is that Gentoo uses bash variables for networking -
and bash cannot use anything outside of English alpha-numerics. To get around
this limitation we change every character that is not an English alpha-numeric
into a _ character.
</p>

<p>
Another downside of bash is the content of variables - some characters need to
be escaped. This can be achived by placing the \ character in front of the
character that needs to be escaped. The following list of characters needs
to be escaped in this way: <c>"</c>, <c>'</c> and  <c>\</c>.
</p>

<p>
In this example we use wireless ESSID as they can contain the widest scope
of characters. We shall use the ESSID <c>My "\ NET</c>:
</p>

<comment># This does work, but the domain is invalid</comment>
dns_domain_My____NET="My \"\\ NET"

<comment># The above sets the dns domain to My "\ NET when a wireless card
# connects to an AP whose ESSID is My "\ NET</comment>
