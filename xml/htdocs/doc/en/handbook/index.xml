account.

<section>
<title>Goal</title>
<body>

<p>
The goal of the Gentoo Handbook is to create a coherent document that describes
every possible aspect of Gentoo Linux. It combines already existing guides in
one, consistent book so that the same document is used for every possible
architecture, every install, every user. This not only makes it easier for us to
maintain, but also for the user to see that the differences are slim, and that
other architectures are not seen as a separate entity.
</p>

<p>
It also allows us to elaborate about difficult points and give more examples. We
aren't forced to write all documentation into a single displayed page anymore
making the documentation read more fluently.
</p>

<section>
<title>Status</title>
<body>

<p>
At this time, the first part on <uri link="handbook.xml?part=1">Installing
Gentoo</uri> is finished and production ready. It is the "official" guide on
installing Gentoo, although the "older" installation guides are still
maintained.
</p>

<p>
We will now start with writing up a draft layout for the next part of the Gentoo
handbook, namely <e>Working with Gentoo</e> (this is not the final title, just a
working name), which contains all Portage-related information, rc-script 
handling, more information about USE-flags etc.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Future</title>
<body>

<p>
When <e>Working with Gentoo</e> is finished we will start with integrating
desktop-related information in the guide.
