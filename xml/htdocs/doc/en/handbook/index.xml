<abstract>
The Gentoo Handbook is an effort to centralise documentation into a coherent
handbook. Information that cannot be inserted coherently is not taken into
account.

<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Welcome to the Gentoo Handbook page. This page will give you some explanation
about the <uri link="handbook.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri> and should answer most
of your questions regarding the handbook. We will talk about the ideas behind
the handbook, its current status, the future plans, how bugreports are handled
etc.

working on a PDF-version.

<title>Information about the handbook</title>
<section>
<title>Goal</title>
<body>

<p>
The goal of the Gentoo Handbook is to create a coherent document that describes
every possible aspect of Gentoo Linux. It combines already existing guides in
one, consistent book so that the same document is used for every possible
architecture, every install, every user. This not only makes it easier for us to
maintain, but also for the user to see that the differences are slim, and that
other architectures are not seen as a separate entity.
</p>

<p>
It also allows us to elaborate about difficult points and give more examples. We
aren't forced to write all documentation into a single displayed page anymore
making the documentation read more fluently.
</p>

<section>
<title>Status</title>
<body>

<p>
At this time, the first part on <uri link="handbook.xml?part=1">Installing
Gentoo</uri> is finished and production ready. It is the "official" guide on
installing Gentoo, although the "older" installation guides are still
maintained.
</p>

<p>
A <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/draft/handbook.xml">draft</uri> layout is created
for the second part of the Gentoo Handbook, called <e>Working with Gentoo</e>.
It includes instructions on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>USE variables and usage</li>
  <li>Portage instructions</li>
  <li>Init scripts</li>
  <li>Environment variables</li>
  <li>Gentoo-related tools</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are interested in the development of this draft, please use <mail
link="gentoo-doc@gentoo.org">the gentoo-doc mailinglist</mail> for all feedback,
or mail <mail link="swift@gentoo.org">Sven Vermeulen</mail> directly.

<title>Future</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="/proj/en/desktop">Gentoo Desktop Project</uri> is working on a
rewrite of the <uri link="/doc/en/desktop.xml">Desktop Configuration Guid</uri>
which should fit in nicely in the Handbook. Currently, no more information is
available at this point. Interested parties should contact <mail
link="gerrynjr@gentoo.org">Gerald J. Normandin Jr.</mail> who is in charge of
this development.
</p>

<p>
Next instructions that will be incorporated in the Guide are the more internal
items regarding Gentoo: how are ebuilds written, what is an e-class, how do I
create my own stages, etc.

<title>Reporting bugs and enhancement requests</title>

If you find a bug in the handbook, please visit our <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux Bugzilla</uri> and create a bug for
<e>Docs-user</e>, Component <e>Handbook</e>.

<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<section>
<title>Why do you group things together?</title>
<body>

<p>
The previous situation, where each architecture had its own installation guide,
was almost impossible to manage clearly. As the x86 architecture is the most
used in the Gentoo community, the x86 installation guide was the most actively
developed. The other architectural guides were left alone and updates that went
into the x86 installation guide didn't reach the other architectural guides,
rendering them corrupt.
</p>

<p>
By grouping the instructions together, every update is propagated to all the
architectures. This is necessary because only a small amount of instructions are
different: <e>booting</e>, <e>partitioning</e>, <e>kernel</e> and
<e>bootloader</e>.
</p>

<section>
<title>Can't you magically have the handbook dynamically created for each choice?</title>
<body>

<p>
Everything is possible, but we have opted not to do this for several reasons.
</p>

<p>
<b>Maintaining</b> the guide would be a lot more difficult. Not only will we
have to map bugreports to certain decisions (far from all bugreports would tell
us what choices they made before) but it would be more difficult to write the
guide fluently: we would have to pay more attention to the line in the handbook,
the consistencies etc.
</p>

<p>
Although we currently only have an online version, <b>other formats</b> are
being developed, such as PDF versions. If we would create PDFs for every
architecture, every option, we would have to provide numerous PDFs of which only
a small amount of sections differ. Talking about a waste of resources :)
</p>

<p>
The choices that the user makes are made <b>at different stadia</b>. This would
make it more difficult for the user to just print out the handbook -- we would
first have to inform the user with all possible options before he can begin,
probably scaring him away.
</p>

<p>
The part on "Installing Gentoo" <b>is not the only part</b> of the Gentoo
Handbook. It is the first, but all following parts are independent of the
choices the user made. Dynamically creating the handbook just for the
installation instructions would be overkill.
</p>

<p>
By not separating the instructions for each possible option, the user can view
the results of the other choices easily. This provides a <b>better view on the
installation instructions</b> for the user: even though he chose - for instance
- stage3, he is easily informed about what stage2 or stage1 does. Not hiding 
these instructions is a good thing.
</p>

<section>
<title>I disagree with ...</title>
<body>

<p>
Please <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">report</uri> your idea; disagreeing 
without providing us with constructive feedback doesn't help the situation.
Documentation is made for the community, so community feedback is well
appreciated.
</p>

<p>
However, you must know that most decisions made while developing documentation
are based on a consensus-model. It is <e>impossible</e> to write/structure
documentation in such a way that everybody is happy with it. You must be able to
accept a "No" with the reason that we believe the current implementation
benefits most people.
