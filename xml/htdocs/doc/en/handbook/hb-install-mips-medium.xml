<title>A note about Processor Architectures</title>
<body>

<p>
On many architectures, the processor has gone through several generations, each
newer generation builds on the foundation of the previous one.  MIPS is no
exception.  There are several generations of CPU covered under the MIPS
architecture.  In order to choose your netboot image stage tarball and
<c>CFLAGS</c> appropriately, you need to be aware of which family your system's
CPU belongs in.  These families are referred to as the <b>I</b>nstruction
<b>S</b>et <b>A</b>rchitecture.

<p>
Also, another important concept to grasp is the concept of <b>endianness</b>.
Endianness refers to the way that a CPU reads words from main memory.  A word
can be read as either <e>big</e> endian (most significant bit first), or
<e>little</e> endian (least significant bit first).  Intel x86 machines are
generally Little endian, whilst Apple and Sparc machines are Big Endian.  On
MIPS, they can be either.  To separate them apart, we append <c>el</c> to the
architecture name to denote little endian.

<title>The Stage3 Tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
A stage3 tarball is an archive containing a minimal Gentoo environment, suitable
to continue the Gentoo installation using the instructions in this manual.
Previously, the Gentoo Handbook described the installation using one of three 
stage tarballs. While Gentoo still offers stage1 and stage2 tarballs, the 
official installation method uses the stage3 tarball. If you are interested in
performing a Gentoo installation using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, please read
the Gentoo FAQ on <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">How do I Install Gentoo
Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?</uri>

<title>Netbooting Overview</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
In this section, we'll cover what you need in order to successfully network boot
a Silicon Graphics workstation or Cobalt Server appliance.  This is just a brief
guide, it is not intended to be thorough, for more information, I recommend
reading the <uri link="/doc/en/diskless-howto.xml">Diskless
HOWTO</uri>.
</p>

<p>
What You Need: Depending on the machine, there is a certain amount of
hardware that you'll need in order to successfully netboot and install Linux.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In General:
    <ul>
      <li>DHCP/BOOTP server (ISC DHCPd recommended)</li>
      <li>Patience -- and lots of it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    For Silicon Graphics workstations:
    <ul>
      <li>TFTP server (tftp-hpa recommended)</li>
      <li>
        If you want/need to use serial console:
        <ul>
          <li>MiniDIN8 --&gt; RS-232 serial cable</li>
          <li>Null-modem cable</li>
          <li>VT100 or ANSI compatable terminal capable of 9600 baud</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    For Cobalt Servers (NOT the original Qube):
    <ul>
      <li>NFS server</li>
      <li>Null-modem cable</li>
      <li>VT100 or ANSI compatable terminal capable of 115200 baud</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<note>
SGI machines use a MiniDIN 8 connector for the serial ports.  Apparently Apple
modem cables work just fine as serial cables, but with Apple machines being
equipped with USB &amp; internal modems, these are getting harder to
find.  A number of sites describe how to make these cables (Google is your
friend).  The following site describes making such a cable.  It's in German,
but has a reasonably good wiring diagram.
<uri link="http://www.arbeitsplatzvernichtung-durch-outsourcing.de/marty44/sgihard.html">
  http://www.arbeitsplatzvernichtung-durch-outsourcing.de/marty44/sgihard.html
</uri>
</note>

<note>
For the terminal, this could be a real VT100/ANSI terminal, or it could be a PC
running terminal emulation software (such as HyperTerminal, Minicom, seyon,
Telex, xc, screen -- whatever your preference).  It doesn't matter what platform
this machine runs -- just so long as it has one RS-232 serial port you can use,
and appropriate software.
</note>

<note>
Note that this guide does NOT cover the original Qube.  The original Qube server
appliance lacks a serial port in its default configuration, and therefore it is
not possible to install Gentoo onto it without the aid of a screwdriver and a
surrogate machine to do the installation.
The following site has a guide for installing Gentoo on these machines.

<title>Setting up TFTP and DHCP -- a brief guide</title>
<body>

<p>
Okay, so you've got your bits and pieces together, now to set everything up.  As
I mentioned earlier -- this is not a complete guide, this is a bare-bones config
that will just get things rolling.  You can either use this when starting a
setup from scratch, or use the suggestions to amend your existing setup to
support netbooting.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that the servers used need not be running Gentoo Linux, you
could quite reasonably use FreeBSD or any Unix-like platform.  However, this
guide will assume you are running Gentoo Linux.  You also may run TFTP/NFS on a
separate machine to the DHCP server if desired.
</p>

<p>
First Step -- configuring DHCP.  In order for the ISC DHCP daemon to respond
to BOOTP requests (as required by the SGI &amp; Cobalt BOOTROM) you need to
first enable dynamic BOOTP on the address range in use; then set up an entry for
each client with pointers to the boot image.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing ISCs DHCP">
# <i>emerge dhcp</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once installed you need to create the <path>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</path>.  Here's
a bare-bones config to get you started.
</p>

<pre caption="Bare Bones dhcpd.conf">
<comment># Tell dhcpd to disable dynamic DNS.</comment>
<comment># dhcpd will refuse to start without this.</comment>
ddns-update-style none;

<comment># Create a subnet:</comment>
subnet <i>192.168.10.0</i> netmask <i>255.255.255.0</i> {
  <comment># Address pool for our booting clients.  Don't forget the 'dynamic-bootp' bit!</comment>
  pool {
    range dynamic-bootp <i>192.168.10.1 192.168.10.254</i>;
  }

  <comment># DNS servers and default gateway -- substitute as appropriate</comment>
  option domain-name-servers <i>203.1.72.96</i>, <i>202.47.56.17</i>;
  option routers <i>192.168.10.1</i>;

  <comment># Tell the DHCP server it's authoritative for this subnet.</comment>
  authoritative;

  <comment># Allow BOOTP to be used on this subnet.</comment>
  allow bootp;
}
</pre>

<p>
With that setup, one can then add any number of clients within the subnet
clause.  We will cover what you need to put in later in this guide.
</p>

<p>
Next Step -- Setting up TFTP server.  For the purposes of this guide, I'll
restrict this to the tftp-hpa TFTP daemon.  I use this myself on SGI machines,
Cobalt servers and PXE clients alike without any hassle.  Installation and
configuration is fairly straightforward:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing tftp-hpa">
# <i>emerge net-ftp/tftp-hpa</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now, I personally like to move my <path>/tftpboot</path> directory into
<path>/home</path> where I have more space.  This is totally optional, and can
be configured through the <path>/etc/conf.d/in.tftpd</path> file.  For the
purposes of this guide, I'll assume you've left it in the default place.
</p>

<p>
Now that everything is configured, we're ready to move onto the fun bit --
tayloring our config to suit the machine we wish to netboot.

<title>Downloading a Netboot image</title>
<body>

<p>
Depending on the system you're installing for, there are several possible images
available for download.  These are all labelled according to the system type and
CPU they are compiled for.  The machine types are as follows:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Codename</th>
    <th>Machines</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>IP22</ti>
    <ti>Indy, *Indigo 2, **Challenge S</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>IP26</ti>
    <ti>*Indigo 2 Power</ti>

    <ti>Octane</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>IP32</ti>
    <ti>O2</ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<note>
* It is a common mistake to mix up the IRIS Indigo (IP12 w/ R3000 CPU or IP20 w/
R4000 CPU, neither of which run Linux), the Indigo 2 (IP22, which runs
Linux fine), the R8000-based Indigo 2 Power (which doesn't run Linux at all) and
the R10000-based Indigo 2 Impact (IP28, which is highly experimental).
Please bear in mind that these are different machines.
</note>

<note>
** On the Challenge S, the UTP network port is hung off a WD33C95 SCSI
card, which is currently unsupported on Linux.  Because of this limitation,
you'll need to use an AUI--&gt;UTP transceiver connected to the AUI port.
</note>

<p>
Also in the filename, r4k refers to R4000-series processors, r5k for R5000,
rm5k for the RM5200 and r10k for R10000.  You will find the images available at

<title>DHCP Configuration for an SGI Client</title>
<body>

<p>
Once you have downloaded the file, simply place it in your
<path>/tftpboot</path> directory.  Then edit your
<path>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</path> and add the entry for your SGI client.
</p>

<note>
You may need to create the <path>/tftpboot</path> directory if it isn't
there already.

<subsection>
<title>Kernel Options</title>
<body>
<p>
We're almost done, but there's a couple of little tweaks still to be done.  Pull
up a console with root privileges, and enter the following commands.
</p>

<pre caption="Some fixes to SGI machines to have TFTP work properly">
<comment>(Disable "Path Maximum Transfer Unit", otherwise SGI Prom won't find the kernel)</comment>
# <i>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc</i>

<comment>(Set the port range usable by the SGI PROM)</comment>
# <i>echo "2048 32767" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</i>
</pre>

<p>
This should be sufficient to allow the Linux server to play nice with SGI's
PROM.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Start Your Daemons...</title>
<body>
<p>
At this point, you should be ready to start the daemons.  Enter the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the DHCP and TFTP daemons">
# <i>/etc/init.d/dhcp start</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/in.tftpd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
If nothing went wrong in that last step you should be all set to power on the
workstation and proceed with the guide.  If the DHCP server isn't firing up for
whatever reason, try running 'dhcpd' on the command line and see what it tells
you -- if all is well, it should just fork into the background, otherwise you'll
see 'exiting.' just below its complaint.
</p>

<p>
An easy way to verify if the tftp daemon is running is to type the following
command -- if you see something like the output mentioned below -- everything is
fine.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking TFTPd is running">
# <i>netstat -al | grep ^udp</i>
udp        0      0 *:bootpc                *:*

udp        0      0 *:tftp                  *:* <comment>&lt;-- (look for this line)</comment>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Netbooting the SGI machine</title>
<body>

<p>
Okay, everything is set, DHCP is running as is TFTP.  Now it is time to fire up
the SGI machine.  Power the unit on -- when you see "Running power-on
diagnostics" on the screen, either click "Stop For Maintenance" or press ESCAPE.
You'll be presented with a menu like the following.  Enter the commands as shown
below.
</p>

<pre caption="SGI PROM Maintenance Menu">
        Running power-on diagnostics

System Maintenance Menu

1) Start System
2) Install System Software
3) Run Diagnostics
4) Recover System
5) Enter Command Monitor

Option? <i>5</i>
Command Monitor. Type "exit" to return to the menu.
&gt;&gt; <i>bootp(): root=/dev/ram0</i>
</pre>

<p>
From this point, the machine should start downloading the image, then, roughly
20 seconds later, start booting Linux.  If all is well, you should be dropped at
the Busybox <c>ash</c> shell as shown below, where you can
move on to <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring Your Network</uri>.

<title>Troubleshooting.</title>
<body>

<p>
If the machine is being stubborn and refusing to download its image, it can be
one of two things, (1) you've made a blunder somewhere, or (2) it needs a little
gentle persuasion. (No, put that sledge hammer down!)  Here's a list of things
you can check:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    dhcpd is giving the SGI Machine an IP Address.  You should see some
    messages about a BOOTP request in the system logs.  <c>tcpdump</c> is also
    useful here.
  </li>
  <li>
    Permissions are set properly in your tftp folder (typically 
    <path>/tftpboot</path> -- should be world readable)
  </li>
  <li>
    Check system logs to see what the tftp server is reporting (errors
    perhaps)
  </li>
<!--
  I really think this tip can go...
  
  <li>
    Pray to a Tux plushie (this may or may not work, and is not an officially
    supported troubleshooting technique)
  </li>-->
</ul>

<p>
If you've checked everything on the server, and you're getting timeouts, etc on
the SGI machine, try typing this into the console.
</p>

<pre caption="Coaxing the SGI PROM to work">

<title>Netbooting on Cobalt Servers</title>

</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Overview of the netboot procedure</title>
<body>

<p>
Unlike the SGI machines, Cobalt servers use NFS to transfer their kernel for
booting.  You boot the machine by holding down the left &amp; right arrow
buttons whilst powering the unit on.  The machine will then attempt to obtain an
IP number via BOOTP, mount the <path>/nfsroot</path> directory from the server via
NFS, then try to download and boot the file <path>vmlinux_raq-2800.gz</path>
which it assumes to be a standard ELF binary.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the Cobalt BOOTROM does not give us any say in this procedure,
so the file HAS to reside in <path>/nfsroot</path> directory, and must be less
than 675kB in size.  In this guide, we'll set up 
<uri link="http://www.colonel-panic.org/cobalt-mips/">CoLo</uri> to allow us to
boot larger kernels than this limit.  CoLo also supports embedded ramdisks,
therefore ridding the need of a full root filesystem sitting in
<path>/nfsroot</path>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Downloading a Netboot image</title>
<body>

<p>
Inside
<uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/cobalt/netboot/">
http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/cobalt/netboot/</uri>
you'll find the necessary boot images for getting a Cobalt up
and running.  The files you need will have the name
<path>cobalt-netboot-YYYYMMDD.img.gz</path> -- select the most recent one and
place it in your <path>/nfsroot</path> directory.  For convenience, rename the
file to <path>gentoo-cobalt.img.gz</path> -- I'll assume that you have done
this.
</p>

<p>
Once that is done, head over to
<uri link="http://www.colonel-panic.org/cobalt-mips/">
http://www.colonel-panic.org/cobalt-mips/</uri> and
download the latest release of the CoLo bootloader.  Untar this somewhere
convenient.  Inside the <path>colo-1.XX/binaries</path> directory created,
you should find under a file named <path>colo-chain.elf</path>.  Gzip this
file up and place it in <path>/nfsroot</path> calling it
<path>vmlinux_raq-2800.gz</path>. Also, in some cases, you will need to create a
symbolic link called <path>boot</path> that points back to
<path>/nfsroot</path>. You can do this in one hit using these commands:
</p>

<note>
Please note, the RaQ1 and Qube 2700 look for <path>vmlinux.gz</path> rather than
<path>vmlinux_raq-2800.gz</path>.

<note>
If the latest CoLo release fails to boot, you may wish to try an earlier
release. Version 1.16 and earlier are known to work.

<title>NFS Server configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Since this machine uses NFS to download its image, you need to export
<path>/nfsroot</path> on your server.  If you have not already done so, you'll
need to install the net-fs/nfs-utils package.
</p>
<pre caption="Installing nfs-utils">
# <i>emerge net-fs/nfs-utils</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once that is done, place the following in your <path>/etc/exports</path> file.
You may set tighter restrictions if you wish.
</p>

<pre caption="Exporting the /nfsroot directory">
/nfsroot      *(ro,sync)
</pre>

<p>
Now, once that is done, you may start the NFS server:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the NFS server">
# <i>/etc/init.d/nfs start</i>
</pre>

<p>
If the NFS server was already running at the time, you can tell it to take
another look at its <c>exports</c> file using <c>exportfs</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Exporting a new filesystem">
# <i>exportfs -av</i>

<title>DHCP Configuration for a Cobalt machine</title>
<body>

<p>
Now, the DHCP side of things is relatively straightforward.  Add the following
to your <path>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</path> file.
</p>

<pre caption="dhcpd.conf snippet for Cobalt server">
subnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx {

  }
}
</pre>

</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Start Your Daemons...</title>
<body>

<p>
At this point, you should be ready to start the daemons.  Enter the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the DHCP and NFS daemons">
# <i>/etc/init.d/dhcp start</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/nfs start</i>
</pre>

<p>
If nothing went wrong in that last step you should be all set to power on the
workstation and proceed with the guide.  If the DHCP server isn't firing up for
whatever reason, try running 'dhcpd' on the command line and see what it tells
you -- if all is well, it should just fork into the background, otherwise you'll
see 'exiting.' just below its complaint.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Netbooting the Cobalt machine</title>
<body>

<p>
Okay, everything is set, DHCP is running as is NFS.  Now it is time to fire up
the Cobalt machine.  Hook up your null modem cable, and set the serial terminal
to use 115200 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, VT100 emulation.  Once that
is done, hold down the left &amp; right arrow buttons whilst powering the unit
on.
</p>

<p>
If all is well, the back panel should display "Net Booting", you should
see some network activity, closely followed by CoLo kicking in.  On the rear
panel, scroll down the menu until you see "Boot Shell" then press ENTER.  On the
serial console, you should be dropped to a prompt as shown below.
</p>

<note>
It has been reported that simply selecting the NFS boot option does all of this
for you under modern versions of CoLo. If selecting this option does not work,
then read on.
</note>

<pre caption="CoLo booting to a prompt">

&gt;
</pre>

<p>
First step, tell the machine to fetch an address via DHCP.  Type <c>dhcp</c> at
the prompt.
</p>

<pre caption="Fetching an address via DHCP">
&gt; <i>dhcp</i>

</pre>

<p>
NOTE: If you have a Windows network you may see messages along the lines of
<c>udp: no matching socket</c>.  These are in response to network broadcasts on
ports that CoLo doesn't recognise.  As annoying as they are, they are perfectly
harmless.
</p>

<pre caption="'no matching socket' error messages">

udp: no matching socket 10.0.0.253:1062 --&gt; 10.0.0.255:137
</pre>

<p>
Okay, the next step is to tell the Cobalt server to download its kernel.
</p>

<pre caption="Downloading the kernel">
&gt; <i>nfs 10.0.0.254 /nfsroot gentoo.img.gz</i>
arp: sent request for 10.0.0.254

<p>
And that's it... it has now downloaded its kernel, we now can tell it to start
booting.

<title>Troubleshooting.</title>
<body>

<p>
If the machine is being stubborn and refusing to download its image, it can be
one of two things, (1) you've made a blunder somewhere, or (2) it needs a little
gentle persuasion. (No, put that sledge hammer down!)  Here's a list of things
you can check:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    dhcpd is giving the Cobalt Machine an IP Address.  You should see some
    messages about a BOOTP request in the system logs.  <c>tcpdump</c> is also
    useful here.
  </li>
  <li>
    Permissions are set properly in your <path>/nfsroot</path> folder.  (should
    be world readable)
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the NFS server is running and exporting the <path>/nfsroot</path>
    directory.  Check this using <c>exportfs -v</c> on the server.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Gentoo/MIPS LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Overview</title>
<body>

<p>
On Silicon Graphics machines, it is possible to boot from a CD in order to
install operating systems.  (This is how one installs IRIX for instance)
Recently, images for such bootable CDs to install Gentoo have been made
possible.  These CDs are designed to work in the same way.
</p>

<p>
At the moment the Gentoo/MIPS Live CD will only work on the SGI Indy,
Indigo 2 and O2 workstations equipped with R4000 and R5000-series CPUs, however
other platforms may be possible in future.
</p>

<p>
You can find the Live CD images for download on your favourite Gentoo Mirror
under the <path>experimental/mips/livecd</path> directory.
</p>

<warn>
These CDs are highly experimental at this time.  They may or may not work at
this time.  You can report success or failures either on
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Bugzilla</uri>,
<uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=242518">this forum
thread</uri> or in the <c>#gentoo-mips</c>
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/irc.xml">IRC channel</uri>.  We would
love to hear from you.
</warn>

<subsection>
<title>Burning a Live CD</title>
<body>

<p>
An important thing to note, the SGI PROM does not understand the ISO9660 format,
nor does it know anything about the El Torito boot standard.  These CD images
are constructed as a SGI disklabel with the boot image in the volume header like
a hard drive.  Therefore, care must be taken when burning the CD image.
</p>

<p>
Below is an example command that assumes 24x burning speed on an IDE burner.  If
you have a SCSI burner for instance, you may want to adjust the <c>dev</c>
statement as appropriate.  Likewise with the <c>speed</c> option - if you
strike troubles, you might want to try dropping the speed.
</p>

<pre caption="Burning using cdrecord">
# <i>bzip2 -d mips-livecd-prototype-rc2-20041027.img.bz2</i>
# <i>cdrecord -vv -pad speed=24 dev=ATAPI:0,0,0 -tao mips-livecd-prototype-rc2-20041027.img</i>
</pre>

<note>
It may be possible to burn these CDs under Windows, assuming your burning
program just blindly burns the image as is.  However, no one has succeeded in
making a working CD this way to date.
</note>

<note>
If you don't know what to put as your <c>dev</c> argument, run <c>cdrecord
-scanbus</c> as root - this will tell you where your burner is located.
