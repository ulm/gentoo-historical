<title>Making your Choice</title>

<title>Introduction</title>

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured and compiled and the necessary system
configuration files are filled in correctly, it is time to install a
program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Such a
program is called a <e>bootloader</e>. But before you start, consider
your options...
</p>

<p>
Several bootloaders exist for Linux/PPC. We have <uri link="yaboot">yaBoot</uri>
(for NewWorld PPC machines) and <uri link="#bootx">BootX</uri> (for OldWorld PPC
machines).

<title>Introduction</title>

<impo>
yaBoot can only be used on NewWorld PPC-based systems!
</impo>

<p>
There are two ways to configure yaBoot for your system. You can use the
new and improved <c>yabootconfig</c> included with
<path>yaboot-1.3.8-r1</path> and later to automatically setup yaboot. If
for some reason you do not want to run <c>yabootconfig</c> to
automatically setup <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> or you are installing Gentoo
on a G5 (on which <c>yabootconfig</c> does not always work), you can just edit 
the sample file already installed on your system.
</p>

</ul>

<title>Default: Using yabootconfig</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>yabootconfig</c> will auto-detect the partitions on your machine and will
setup dual and triple boot combinations with Linux, Mac OS, and Mac OS
X.
</p>

<p>
To use <c>yabootconfig</c>, your drive must have a bootstrap partition, and
<path>/etc/fstab</path> must be configured with your Linux partitions. Both of 
these should have been done already in the steps above. To start, ensure that
you have the latest version of yaboot installed by running <c>emerge --update
yaboot</c>. This is necessary as the latest version will be available via
Portage, but it may not have made it into the stage files.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing yaboot">
# <i>emerge --usepkg --update yaboot</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now run <c>yabootconfig</c>. The program will run and it will confirm
the location of the bootstrap partition. Type <c>Y</c> if it is correct. If
not, double check <path>/etc/fstab</path>. yabootconfig will then scan your
system setup, create <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> and run <c>mkofboot</c> for
you. <c>mkofboot</c> is used to format the bootstrap partition, and install 
the yaboot configuration file into it.
</p>

<p>
You might want to verify the contents of <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path>. If 
you make changes to <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> (like setting the 
default/boot OS), make sure to rerun <c>ybin -v</c> to apply changes to the 
bootstrap partition.
</p>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=10">Installing Necessary System
Tools</uri>.

<subsection id="manual_yaboot">
<title>Alternative: Manual yaBoot Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
First make sure you have the latest <c>yaboot</c> installed on your
system:
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing yaboot">
# <i>emerge --usepkg --update yaboot</i>
</pre>

<p>
Below you find a completed <path>yaboot.conf</path> file. Alter it at
will. G5 users should be aware that their disks are Serial ATA disks which are
seen as SCSI disks by the Linux kernel (so substitute <path>/dev/hda</path> with
<path>/dev/sda</path>).
</p>

<comment>## /etc/yaboot.conf

## run: "man yaboot.conf" for details. Do not make changes until you have!!
## see also: /usr/share/doc/yaboot/examples for example configurations.
##
## For a dual-boot menu, add one or more of:
## bsd=/dev/hdaX, macos=/dev/hdaY, macosx=/dev/hdaZ

## our bootstrap partition:</comment>

boot=/dev/hda9

<comment>## ofboot is the openfirmware way to specify the bootstrap partition.
## If this isn't defined, yaboot fails on the G5 (unless you pass the necessary
## arguments to the mkofboot/ybin program).
## hd:X means /dev/sdaX (or /dev/hdaX).
## 
## G5 users should uncomment this line!!

#ofboot=hd:9</comment>

<comment>##hd: is open firmware speak for hda</comment>
device=hd:

defaultos=macosx
timeout=30

## boot options

enablecdboot

</pre>

<p>
Once <path>yaboot.conf</path> is set up the way you want it, you run 
<c>mkofboot -v</c> to install the settings in the bootstrap partition. <e>Don't 
forget this!</e> If all goes well, and you have the same options as the sample 
above, your next reboot will give you a simple, five-entry boot menu. If you 
update your yaboot config later on, you'll just need to run <c>ybin -v</c> to 
update the bootstrap partition - <c>mkofboot</c> is for initial setup only.
</p>

<p>
For more information on yaboot, take a look at the <uri
link="http://penguinppc.org/projects/yaboot">yaboot project</uri>. For
now, continue the installation with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=10">Installing
Necessary System Tools</uri>.

<title>Alternative: BootX</title>

<impo>
BootX can only be used on OldWorld PPC-based systems!
</impo>

<p>
If you want to use BootX, then you don't have to do anything at this
stage. However, after rebooting, you will have to some configuration in
the BootX control panel (inside MacOS). We discuss this later in the
installation.

For now, continue with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=10">Installing Necessary
