<p>
Before we start, we first list what hardware requirements you need to
succesfully install Gentoo on your box. This is ofcourse dependent on your
architecture.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For the <e>x86 architecture</e>, you need a 486+ processor and
    at least 64 megabytes of memory.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <e>Alpha architecture</e>, you should check with the <uri
    link="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/FAQ-5.html">Alpha/Linux FAQ</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <e>hppa architecture</e>, you should check with the <uri 
    link="http://pateam.esiee.fr/list.html">ESIEE website</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <e>PowerPC architecture</e>, you need an iMac or a Pegasos.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <e>SPARC architecture</e>, you should check with the <uri
    link="http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html#s_2">UltraLinux FAQ</uri>.

<title>Making your Choice</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Still interested in trying out Gentoo? Well, then it is now time to
choose the installation medium you want to use. Yes, you have the
choice, no, they are not all equal, and yes, the result is always a base
Gentoo system.
</p>

<p>
The installation media we will describe are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Gentoo LiveCDs</li>
<li>Knoppix</li>
<li>Other Distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every single media has its advantages and disadvantages. We will list
the pros and cons of every medium so you have all the information to
make a justified decision. But before we continue, let's explain our
three-stage installation.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>The Three Stages</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using one of three <e>stage</e> tarball files.
The one you choose depends on how much of the system you want to compile
yourself. The <e>stage1</e> tarball is used when you want to bootstrap and
build the entire system from scratch. The <e>stage2</e> tarball is used for
building the entire system from a bootstrapped &quot;semi-compiled&quot; state.
The <e>stage3</e> tarball already contains a basic Gentoo Linux system that has
been built for you. As we will explain later, you can also install
Gentoo without compiling anything (except your kernel). If you want
this, you'll ofcourse have to choose for a <e>stage3</e> tarball.
</p>

<p>
Now what stage do you have to choose?
</p>

<p>
Starting from a <e>stage1</e> allows you to have total control over the
optimization settings and optional build-time functionality that is
initially enabled on your system. This makes <e>stage1</e> installs good for
power users who know what they are doing. It is also a great
installation method for those who would like to know more about the
inner workings of Gentoo Linux.
</p>

<p>
<e>Stage2</e> installs allow you to skip the bootstrap process and doing this
is fine if you are happy with the optimization settings that we chose
for your particular <e>stage2</e> tarball.
</p>

<p>
Choosing to go with a <e>stage3</e> allows for the fastest install of Gentoo
Linux, but also means that your base system will have the optimization
settings that we chose for you (which to be honest, are good settings
and were carefully chosen to enhance performance while maintaining
stability).
</p>

<p>
Choose now.
</p>

<p>
Now take a look at the available installation media with your choice in
mind.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo LiveCDs</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo LiveCDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allows you to install Gentoo
onto your hard disks without having to boot from your hard disks.
They are maintained by Gentoo developers and are available
for all supported architectures (x86, alpha, sparc, ppc, hppa). Even
more, some architectures have several available LiveCDs. 
</p>

<p>
All LiveCDs allow you to boot, setup networking, initialise your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet. However, some
LiveCDs also contain all necessary source code or even precompiled
packages so you are able to install Gentoo without networking.
</p>

<p>
&quot;What? Precompiled packages?&quot; I hear you shout. Yes, indeed,
precompiled packages. As Gentoo is all about choices, we want to provide
our users the possibility to quickly install Gentoo. The collection of
precompiled packages is called the <e>Gentoo Reference Platform</e>
(GRP).
</p>

<p>
The following table lists all available LiveCDs, together with the
architecture(s) they work on and extra's they provide (if any). A small
note though: the <e>Download Location</e> in the table is a relative
path to the LiveCDs. It is relative to the main Gentoo directory on our
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>.

<p>
If you want to install Gentoo from a LiveCD, please use one of our <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri> to
download the correct ISO.
</p>

<p>
Now what do these LiveCDs provide?
</p>

<p>
Every architecture provides a small, no-nonsense, bootable CD which sole purpose
is to boot the system, prepare the networking and continue with the Gentoo
installation. It does not contain any stages (or in certain cases a stage1
file), source code or precompiled packages. If you want such a small bootable
CD, you need the <b>basic x86 livecd</b>, <b>alpha livecd</b>, <b>sparc
livecd</b>, <b>ppc nostages livecd</b> or <b>hppa livecd</b>, depending on your
architecture.
</p>

<p>
Some architectures (x86 and ppc to be precise) also provide a two-CD set. The 
first one (cd-1) is a bootable CD containing all stages for a specific 
subarchitecture (such as PentiumII, or G4) together with source code and 
precompiled packages. The second one (cd-2) only contains precompiled packages 
and can be used to install other packages after the Gentoo Installation. To 
install Gentoo, you only need cd-1, but if you want OpenOffice.org, Mozilla, 
XFree etc. without having to compile every single one of them, you need cd-2
too. The available two-CD sets are <b>x86 cd-1 &amp; cd-2</b> and <b>ppc cd-1
&amp; cd2</b>.
</p>

<p>
For the ppc architecture, we also provide a <b>ppc kde/gnome livecd</b>. This cd
contains a complete live Gentoo environment featuring the KDE and Gnome desktop
environment, an apache webserver, several webbrowsers, irc clients,
firewall/router stuff, network auditing stuff, a lot of CLI tools... It can be
used to fix a broken OS X filesystem. The kde/gnome livecd contains an entire
gcc (distcc, ccache enabled) toolchain; boot all macs on your network using this
cd and experience the power of distributed compilation. Other non-ppc gentoo
livecds are distcc enabled too and distributed cross-compilation (use your x86,
sparcs, etc to build for ppc or others) will be available soon. This cd can be
used to install Gentoo, but does not contain GRP, distfiles, nor a portage
snapshot or stages. 
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Knoppix</title>
<body>

<p>
<e>Knoppix</e> is a well-known bootable CD with a fully working desktop
environment. It allows you to boot from CD and, without interaction with
your disk, start up office applications or system tools. In our case, we
will use the system and networking tools to install Gentoo.
</p>

<p>
If you plan on using Knoppix, you can download it from <uri
link="http://www.knoppix.com">the Knoppix homepage</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Other Distributions</title>
<body>

<p>
If you start installing from another already installed Linux
distribution, then you can benefit from all the tools already available in your
installed Linux distribution. Skip the rest of this section and continue with
"<e>Configuring your Network</e>".
</p>

<p>
Now make your choice of installation medium and continue with the
appropriate section. As this is a Gentoo handbook, we'll default to using
the Gentoo LiveCDs, but you can find the necessary information about
using the other installation media as alternative sections.

<section>
<title>Default: Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the LiveCDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo LiveCD (if not, then you are reading the
wrong section). We'll first start by downloading and burning the chosen
LiveCD. We previously discussed the several available LiveCDs and
mentioned their relative path on the mirrors. Use that information to 
download your LiveCD(s). 
</p>

<p>
Visit one of our <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri> and go to
the path where the LiveCD(s) of your choice are located. Inside that
directory you'll find so-called ISO-files. Those are full CD images
which you can write on a CD-R. If you find several ISOs with different 
date-tags (such as <path>livecd-x86-cd1-20031029.iso</path>) take the most 
recent one.
</p>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss a couple of popular
tools on how to do this.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With EasyCD Creator you select <c>File</c>, <c>Record CD
    from CD image</c>. Then you change the <c>Files of type</c> to <c>ISO image
    file</c>. Then locate the ISO file and click <c>Open</c>. When you click on
    <c>Start recording</c> the ISO image will be burnt correctly onto the CD-R.
  </li>
  <li>
    With Nero Burning ROM, select <c>File</c>, <c>Burn CD image</c>. Set the
    type of file to <c>*.*</c> and select the ISO file. Older versions of Nero
    will tell you they don't recognize the format -- confirm here, it does
    recognize it but doesn't know it yet :) In the next dialog, set the
    following parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>Type of image: <c>Data Mode 1</c></li>
      <li>Block size: <c>2048 bytes</c></li>
      <li>File precursor and length of the image trailer: <c>0 bytes</c></li>
      <li>Scrambled: <c>no</c></li>
      <li>Swapped: <c>no</c></li>
    </ul>
    Now click on <c>OK</c> and then <c>Burn</c> (the CD-R)
  </li>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord</c> followed by the path to the
    ISO file :)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following subsections explain how to boot the archicture-specific LiveCDs. 
Be sure to pick the subsection which is relevant for your architecture. 
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the x86 LiveCD(s)</title>
<body>

<warn>
This subsection is for x86 architectures <e>only</e>. Read this whole subsection
before continuing, as you will not always have the time to read before acting.
</warn>

<p>
Once you have burnt your installation CDs, it is time to boot them.
Reboot your system and enter the BIOS. Inside the BIOS, change the boot
order so that the CD-ROM is tried before the hard disk. If you don't do
this, your system will just reboot from the hard disk, ignoring the
CD-ROM.
</p>

<p>
Now place the installation CD in the CD-ROM drive (duh) and reboot. You
should see a fancy boot screen with the Gentoo Linux logo on it. At this
screen, you can hit Enter to begin the boot process with the default
boot options, or boot the LiveCD with custom boot options by specifying a 
kernel followed by boot options and then hitting Enter. 
</p>

<p>
Specifying a kernel? Yes, we provide several kernels on our LiveCDs. The
default one is <c>gentoo</c>. This one activates framebuffer (graphical
interface by directly accessing the video card instead of using an X
server). If you don't want framebuffer, or the default kernel doesn't
display right, try <c>nofb</c>, which doesn't activate framebuffer.
</p>

<p>
Other kernels are <c>smp</c>, which activates support for multi-cpu
systems and <c>acpi</c> which activates ACPI (Advanced Configuration Power
Interface). We also provide <c>memtest</c>, which tests your RAM for
errors (but you can't install Gentoo from <c>memtest</c>).
</p>

<p>
Below you'll find a short overview on the available kernels:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Kernel</th>
  <th>Description</th>

<tr>
  <ti>gentoo</ti>
  <ti>Default kernel with framebuffer support</ti>

</table>

<note>
Some LiveCDs provide extra kernels, or don't provide kernels listed in
this document. To list the available kernels at boot-time, press F1 when
you are at the bootscreen.
</note>

<p>
You can also provide kernel options. They represent optional settings
you can (de)activate at will. The following table explains all available
kernel options.

</table>

<note>
Some LiveCDs provide extra boot options, or don't provide boot options
listed in this document. To list the available kernels at boot-time,
press F2 when you are at the bootscreen.
</note>

<p>
Now boot your CD, select a kernel (if you are not happy with the default
<c>gentoo</c> kernel) and boot options. As an example, we show you how
to boot the <c>nofb</c> kernel, with <c>dopcmcia cdcache</c> as kernel
parameters:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting a LiveCD">
boot: <i>nofb dopcmcia cdcache</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will then be greeted with another boot screen and progress bar. Once
the boot process completes, you will be automatically logged in to the
&quot;Live&quot; Gentoo Linux as &quot;root&quot;, the super user. You should 
have a root (&quot;#&quot;) prompt on the current console and can also switch 
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one 
you started on by pressing Alt-F1.
</p>

<p>
Now continue with "<e>Extra Hardware Configuration</e>".
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the Alpha LiveCD(s)</title>
<body>

<warn>
This subsection is for alpha architectures <e>only</e>. Read this whole
subsection before continuing, as you will not always have the time to read 
before acting.
</warn>

<p>
When your Alpha is powered on, the first thing that gets started is the
firmware. It is loosely synonymous with the BIOS software on PC systems. There
are two types of firmware on Alpha systems: SRM (<e>Systems Reference 
Manual</e>) and ARC (<e>Advanced Risc Console</e>).
</p>

<p>
SRM is based on the Alpha Console Subsystem specification, which provides an
operating environment for OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and Linux operating systems. ARM
is based on the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification, which provides
an operating environment for Windows NT.
</p>

<p>
If your Alpha system supports both SRC and ARCs (ARC, AlphaBIOS, ARCSBIOS) you
should follow <uri link="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/x31.html">these
instructions</uri> for switching to SRM. If your system already uses SRM, you
are all set. If your system can only use ARCs (Ruffian, nautilus, xl, etc.) you
will need to choose <c>MILO</c> later on when we are talking about bootloaders.
</p>

<p>
Now to boot an Alpha LiveCD, put the CD-ROM in the tray and reboot the system.
You can use SRM to boot the LiveCD. If you cannot do that, you will have to use
<c>MILO</c>. If you don't have <c>MILO</c> installed already, use one of the
precompiled <c>MILO</c> images available on <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/milo/">taviso's homepage</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Booting a CD-ROM using SRM">
<comment>(Substitute dqa0 with your CD-ROM drive device)</comment>

MILO&gt; <i>boot hdb:boot/vmlinuz initrd=initrd.img root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc</i>
</pre>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1.
</p>

<p>
Now continue with "<e>Extra Hardware Configuration</e>".
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the HPPA LiveCD(s)</title>
<body>

<warn>
This subsection is for HPPA architectures <e>only</e>. Read this whole 
subsection before continuing, as you will not always have the time to read 
before acting.
</warn>

<p>
Boot your HPPA system. During the boot process, you will see a message similar
to the following:
</p>

<pre caption="HPPA boot message">
Searching for Potential Boot Devices.
To terminate search, press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>

<p>
When this message appears, press and hold the Esc-key until an option menu
appears. This can take a while, be patient. By default, you should enter the
BOOT_ADMIN console. If you receive an option menu, choose <c>Enter Boot
Administration mode</c> to enter the BOOT_ADMIN console. You should now have an
'&gt;' prompt.
</p>

<p>
Put the Gentoo LiveCD in the CD-ROM. If you do not know the SCSI ID of your
CD-ROM drive, your PA-RISC station will search for it when you issue the 
<c>search</c> command.
</p>

<pre caption="Searching for SCSI ID">
&gt; <i>search</i>

To terminate search, please press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>

<p>
Your PA-RISC station will now display all the available boot media. This is an
example result of this command :

</pre>

<p>
To boot from a CD-ROM you need the accompanying Device Path. For instance, if we
want to boot from the TOSHIBA CD-ROM in the above example, we would need to type
the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting from a CD-ROM">
&gt; <i>boot scsi.5.0 ipl</i>

Trying scsi.5.0
</pre>

<p>
The <c>ipl</c> keyword (Initial Program Loader) tells palo (the PA-RISC boot
LOader) to enter interactive mode. This will allow you to change, for example,
the kernel boot parameters.
</p>

<p>
When the boot is succesful, palo will start in interactive mode:
</p>

<pre caption="PALO Interactive Mode">

If you need extra features you must add the apropriate keyword(s) to the end of 
the command line. To add a keyword, edit the last field, add a space and type 
your keyword. The only implemented keyword as of now is <c>cdcache</c> which 
tells the LiveCD to load itself into RAM, allowing you to unmount the CD.

Insert the Gentoo LiveCD in the CD-ROM and boot your system. Once you are in the
OBP, boot from the CD-ROM:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting the LiveCD">

<p>
You will be greeted by the SILO boot manager (on the LiveCD). Type in
<c>gentoo</c> and press enter to continue booting the system.
</p>

<pre caption="Continue booting from the LiveCD">

Place the LiveCD in the CD-ROM and reboot the system. Hold down the 'C' key at
bootup (or run an OldWorld bootloader like BootX or quik). You will be greeted
by a friendly welcome message and a <e>boot:</e> prompt at the bottom of the 
screen.
</p>

<p>
At this prompt, hit enter, and a complete Gentoo Linux environment will be
loaded from the CD. If you experience problems booting, choose the <c>-safe</c>
option at boot. The safe option passes the following extra arguments to the 
kernel: <c>append="video=ofonly nol3 init=/linuxrc"</c>.
</p>

<p>
When the LiveCD is booted, you will be greeted with a login prompt. Log on as
<c>root</c> and leave the password blank (i.e. press Enter).

<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
When the Live CD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware devices and
loads the appropiate kernel modules to support your hardware. In the
vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However, in some cases,
it may not auto-load the kernel modules you need. If the PCI
auto-detection missed some of your system's hardware, you will have to
load the appropriate kernel modules manually. 
</p>

<p>
For instance, if you want to access your SCSI hardware but the LiveCD
hasn't automatically detected your SCSI hardware, you will need to load
the appropriate kernel modules using <c>modprobe</c>. In the next
example we try to load the <c>aic7xxx</c> module (support for certain
kinds of SCSI controllers) and the <c>sd_mod</c> module (support for
SCSI disks). This example isn't valid, since those drivers are
built-in into the kernel, but hey -- it's just an example :)

<title>Optional: Tweaking Hard Disk Performance</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are an advanced user, you might want to tweak the IDE hard disk
performance using <c>hdparm</c>. With the <c>-tT</c> options you can
test the performance of your disk (execute it several times to get a
preciser impression):
</p>

<pre caption="Testing disk performance">
# <i>hdparm -tT</i>
</pre>

<p>
To tweak, you can use any of the following examples (or experiment
yourself) which use <path>/dev/hda</path> as disk (substitute with your
disk):
</p>

<pre caption="Tweaking hard disk performance">
<comment>Activate DMA:</comment>                                       # <i>hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda</i>

<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment, you need to create the necessary user
accounts and change the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter his credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>

<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<warn>
Only x86, alpha, sparc and ppc provide the possibility to start an ssh daemon 
during installation.
</warn>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them, or provide them with your root password (<e>only</e>
do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">

<title>Alternative: Download, Burn and Boot Knoppix</title>
<body>

<warn>
You can only use Knoppix on x86-based systems.
</warn>

<p>
You can download Knoppix from the <uri
link="http://www.knoppix.com">Knoppix homepage</uri>. Knoppix too is
available as ISO-files. After having downloaded the Knoppix ISO file,
burn it to a CD-R. You have to use &quot;raw&quot; burning. We'll
explain how to do this with a couple of popular tools.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With EasyCD Creator you select <c>File</c>, <c>Record CD
    from CD image</c>. Then you change the <c>Files of type</c> to <c>ISO image
    file</c>. Then locate the ISO file and click <c>Open</c>. When you click on
    <c>Start recording</c> the ISO image will be burnt correctly onto the CD-R.
  </li>
  <li>
    With Nero Burning ROM, select <c>File</c>, <c>Burn CD image</c>. Set the
    type of file to <c>*.*</c> and select the ISO file. Older versions of Nero
    will tell you they don't recognize the format -- confirm here, it does
    recognize it but doesn't know it yet :) In the next dialog, set the
    following parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>Type of image: <c>Data Mode 1</c></li>
      <li>Block size: <c>2048 bytes</c></li>
      <li>File precursor and length of the image trailer: <c>0 bytes</c></li>
      <li>Scrambled: <c>no</c></li>
      <li>Swapped: <c>no</c></li>
    </ul>
    Now click on <c>OK</c> and then <c>Burn</c> (the CD-R)
  </li>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord</c> followed by the path to the
    ISO file :)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
By default, Knoppix boots into a KDE 3.0 desktop. The first thing you'll
have to do is set the root password for knoppix. Open a konsole and type
in the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting root password for Knoppix">
$ <i>sudo passwd root</i>
Password: <comment>(Enter a password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter the password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Next, <c>su</c> to root and set the root home directory to
<path>/root</path>. If you do not do this, you will receive errors when
emerging about &quot;/home/root: not found&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Changing root home directory">
$ <i>su -</i>
Password: <comment>(Enter the root password created above)</comment>
# <i>usermod -d /root -m root</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now exit the current shell by typing <c>exit</c> and <c>su</c> back into
root. This will load the made changes. 
</p>

<pre caption="Loading the changes">
# <i>exit</i>
$ <i>su -</i>
Password: <comment>(Enter the root password)</comment>
