<title>The Gentoo Universal LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using one of three <e>stage</e> tarball files. A
stage file is a tarball (compressed archive) that contains a minimal
environment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A stage1 file contains nothing more than a compiler, Portage (Gentoo's
    software management system) and a couple of packages on which the 
    compiler or Portage depends. 
  </li>
  <li>
    A stage2 file contains a so-called bootstrapped system, a minimal
    environment from which one can start building all other necessary 
    applications that make a Gentoo environment complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    A stage3 file contains a prebuilt minimal system which is almost fully
    deployable. It only lacks a few applications where you, the Gentoo user, 
    needs to choose which one you want to install.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
We will opt for a stage3 installation throughout this document. If you want to
perform a Gentoo installation using the stage1 or stage2 files, please use the
installation instructions in the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>. They do
require a working Internet connection though.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Universal LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
A LiveCD is a bootable CDs which contain a self-sustained Gentoo environment. 
It allows you to boot Linux from the CD. During the boot process your hardware 
is detected and the appropriate drivers are loaded. The Gentoo LiveCDs are
maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
There currently are two LiveCDs available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Universal LiveCD contains everything you need to install Gentoo. It
    provides stage3 files for common architectures, source code for the extra
    applications you need to choose from and, of course, the installation
    instructions for your architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Minimal LiveCD contains only a minimal environment that allows you to
    boot up and configure your network so you can connect to the Internet. It
    does not contain any additional files and cannot be used during the current
    installation approach.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Gentoo also provides a Package CD. This is no LiveCD but an additional resource
that you can exploit during the installation of your Gentoo system. It contains
prebuilt packages (the so-called GRP set) that allows you to easily and quickly
install additional applications (such as OpenOffice.org, KDE, GNOME, ...)
immediately after the Gentoo installation and right before you update your
Portage tree.
</p>

<p>
The use of the Package CD is covered later in this document. 
</p>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot the Gentoo Universal LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
You can download the Universal LiveCDs (and, if you want to, the Packages CD as
well) from one of our <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The
LiveCDs are located in the <path>releases/ppc/2004.3/livecd</path> directory;
the Package CDs are located in the <path>releases/ppc/2004.3/packagecd</path>
directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside those directories you'll find so-called ISO-files. Those are full CD 
images which you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
After downloading the file, you can verify its integrity to see if it is 
corrupted or not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we 
    provide (for instance with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or 
    <uri link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows)
  </li>
  <li>
    You can verify the cryptographic signature that we provide. You need to
    obtain the public key we use (17072058) before you proceed though.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To fetch our public key using the GnuPG application, run the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path) followed by the path to the ISO file :)
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Default: Booting the Universal LiveCD on an Apple/IBM</title>
<body>

<p>
On NewWorld machines place the LiveCD in the CD-ROM and reboot the system. When
the system-start-bell sounds, simply hold down the 'C' until the CD loads.
</p>

<p>
If you have an OldWorld Mac the bootable portion of the livecd can't be used.
Instead you need to download <uri
link="http://penguinppc.org/projects/bootx/">BootX</uri> and have a working
MacOS installed on your system. You need to copy the <c>BootX Extension</c> from
the unpacked archive-file into the <c>Extensions Folder</c> and make a new
directory called <c>Linux Kernels</c> in the System Folder. In the next step you
need to copy the files <c>G3G4kernel</c> and <c>initrd.img.gz</c> from the
LiveCD <path>boot</path> folder into the <c>Linux Kernels</c> directory. Then
reboot the system and wait for BootX to load. After BootX loaded you still have
to set up a few items. In the options dialog you need to check <c>Use Specified
RAM Disk</c> and select the <c>initrd.img.gz</c> which you put in the <c>Linux
Kernels</c> directory. The ramdisk size should be set to at least <c>32000</c>.
Furthermore the kernel argument needs to be set to <c>rw init=/linuxrc
cdroot</c>.  Eventually you are able to boot the LiveCD when you select Linux on
Startup.
</p>

<p>
After the LiveCD loaded, you will be greeted by a friendly welcome message and a
<e>boot:</e> prompt at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p>
At this prompt you are able to select a kernel for the subarchitecture you use.
We provide <c>G3</c>, <c>G4</c> and <c>G5</c>. All kernels are built with
support for multiple CPUs, but they will boot on single processor machines as
well.
</p>

<p>
You are also able to tweak some kernel options at this prompt. The following
table lists the available boot options you can add:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Boot Option</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>video</c></ti>
  <ti>
    This option takes one of the following vendor-specific tags:
    <c>radeonfb</c>, <c>rivafb</c>, <c>atyfb</c>, <c>aty128</c> or
    <c>ofonly</c>. You can follow this tag with the resolution and refreshrate
    you want to use. For instance <c>video=radeonfb:1280x1024@75</c>. If you are
    uncertain what to choose, <c>ofonly</c> will most certainly work.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>nol3</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Disables level 3 cache on some PowerBooks (needed for at least the 17&quot;)
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>debug</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Enables verbose booting, spawns an initrd shell that can be used to debug
    the LiveCD
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>sleep=X</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Wait X seconds before continuing; this can be needed by some very old SCSI
    CD-ROMs which don't speed up the CD quick enough
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>bootfrom=X</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Boot from a different device
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
At this prompt, hit enter, and a complete Gentoo Linux environment will be
loaded from the CD. Continue with <uri link="#booted">And When You're
Booted...</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Alternative: Booting the Universal LiveCD on a Pegasos</title>
<body>

<p>
On the Pegasos simply insert the CD and at the SmartFirmware boot-prompt type
<c>boot cd /boot/pegasos</c>. If you need any special boot options you can append them to the
command-line. For instance <c>boot cd /boot/pegasos video=radeonfb:1280x1024@75 mem=256M</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="booted">
<title>And When You're Booted...</title>
<body>

<p>
You will be greeted by a root ("#") prompt on the current console. You can also 
switch to other consoles by pressing Alt-fn-F2, Alt-fn-F3 and Alt-fn-F4. Get 
back to the one you started on by pressing Alt-fn-F1.
</p>

<p>
If you are installing Gentoo on a system with a non-US keyboard, use
<c>loadkeys</c> to load the keymap for your keyboard. To list the available
keymaps, execute <c>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</c>.  Do not use the keymaps in
<path>ppc</path> or <path>mac</path> as they are for ADB-based OldWorld
machines.
</p>

<pre caption="Listing available keymaps">
<comment>(PPC uses x86 keymaps on most systems. The mac/ppc keymaps provided
 on the LiveCD are ADB keymaps and unusable with the LiveCD kernel)</comment>
# <i>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now load the keymap of your choice:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading a keymap">
# <i>loadkeys be-latin1</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware Configuration</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="hardware">
<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
When the LiveCD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware devices and
loads the appropriate kernel modules to support your hardware. In the
vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However, in some cases, it may
not auto-load the kernel modules you need. If the PCI auto-detection missed some
of your system's hardware, you will have to load the appropriate kernel modules
manually. 
</p>

<p>
In the next example we try to load the <c>airport</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe airport</i>
</pre>

<subsection>
<title>Optional: Tweaking Hard Disk Performance</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are an advanced user, you might want to tweak the IDE hard disk
performance using <c>hdparm</c>. With the <c>-tT</c> options you can
test the performance of your disk (execute it several times to get a
more precise impression):
</p>

<pre caption="Testing disk performance">
# <i>hdparm -tT /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

<p>
To tweak, you can use any of the following examples (or experiment
yourself) which use <path>/dev/hda</path> as disk (substitute with your
disk):
</p>

<pre caption="Tweaking hard disk performance">
<comment>Activate DMA:</comment>                                       # <i>hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda</i>
<comment>Activate DMA + Safe Performance-enhancing Options:</comment>  # <i>hdparm -d 1 -A 1 -m 16 -u 1 -a 64 /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook (either from-CD or online) during the
installation, make sure you have created a user account (see <uri
link="#useraccounts">Optional: User Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to
go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>links2</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>links2 /mnt/cdrom/docs/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD. You can view it using <c>links2</c>
as well, but only after having completed the <e>Configuring your Network</e>
chapter (otherwise you won't be able to go on the Internet to view the
document):
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>links2 http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
