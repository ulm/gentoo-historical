<title>The Gentoo Universal LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using one of three <e>stage</e> tarball files. A
stage file is a tarball (compressed archive) that contains a minimal
environment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A stage1 file contains nothing more than a compiler, Portage (Gentoo's
    software management system) and a couple of packages on which the 
    compiler or Portage depends. 
  </li>
  <li>
    A stage2 file contains a so-called bootstrapped system, a minimal
    environment from which one can start building all other necessary 
    applications that make a Gentoo environment complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    A stage3 file contains a prebuilt minimal system which is almost fully
    deployable. It only lacks a few applications where you, the Gentoo user, 
    needs to choose which one you want to install.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
We will opt for a stage3 installation throughout this document. If you want to
perform a Gentoo installation using the stage1 or stage2 files, please use the
installation instructions in the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>. They do
require a working Internet connection though.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Universal LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
A LiveCD is a bootable CDs which contain a self-sustained Gentoo environment. 
It allows you to boot Linux from the CD. During the boot process your hardware 
is detected and the appropriate drivers are loaded. The Gentoo LiveCDs are
maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
There currently are two LiveCDs available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Universal LiveCD contains everything you need to install Gentoo. It
    provides stage3 files for common architectures, source code for the extra
    applications you need to choose from and, of course, the installation
    instructions for your architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Minimal LiveCD contains only a minimal environment that allows you to
    boot up and configure your network so you can connect to the Internet. It
    does not contain any additional files and cannot be used during the current
    installation approach.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Gentoo also provides a Package CD. This is no LiveCD but an additional resource
that you can exploit during the installation of your Gentoo system. It contains
prebuilt packages (the so-called GRP set) that allows you to easily and quickly
install additional applications (such as OpenOffice.org, KDE, GNOME, ...)
immediately after the Gentoo installation and right before you update your
Portage tree.
</p>

<p>
The use of the Package CD is covered later in this document. 
</p>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot the Gentoo Universal LiveCD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the LiveCD</title>
<body>

<p>
You can download the Universal LiveCDs (and, if you want to, the Packages CD as
well) from one of our <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The
LiveCDs are located in the <path>releases/hppa/2004.3/livecd</path> directory;
the Package CDs are located in the <path>releases/hppa/2004.3/packagecd</path>
directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside those directories you'll find so-called ISO-files. Those are full CD 
images which you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
After downloading the file, you can verify its integrity to see if it is 
corrupted or not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we 
    provide (for instance with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or 
    <uri link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows)
  </li>
  <li>
    You can verify the cryptographic signature that we provide. You need to
    obtain the public key we use (17072058) before you proceed though.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To fetch our public key using the GnuPG application, run the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path) followed by the path to the ISO file :)
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Booting the Universal LiveCD</title>
<body>

<note>
If you have problems booting the LiveCD or any other media, please read the
<uri link="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PA-RISC-Linux-Boot-HOWTO/index.html">
PA-RISC Linux Boot HOWTO</uri>.
</note>

<p>
Boot your HPPA system. During the boot process, you will see a message similar
to the following:
</p>

<pre caption="HPPA boot message">
Searching for Potential Boot Devices.
To terminate search, press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>

<p>
When this message appears, press and hold the Esc-key until an option menu
appears. This can take a while, be patient. By default, you should enter the
BOOT_ADMIN console. If you receive an option menu, choose <c>Enter Boot
Administration mode</c> to enter the BOOT_ADMIN console. You should now have an
'&gt;' prompt.
</p>

<p>
Put the Gentoo LiveCD in the CD-ROM. If you do not know the SCSI ID of your
CD-ROM drive, your PA-RISC station will search for it when you issue the 
<c>search</c> command.
</p>

<pre caption="Searching for SCSI ID">
&gt; <i>search</i>
Searching for Devices with Bootable Media.
To terminate search, please press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>

<p>
Your PA-RISC station will now display all the available boot media. This is an
example result of this command:
</p>

<pre caption="Available boot media">

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

P0                    scsi.5.0                TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-3301TA
                                                  IPL
P1                    scsi.2.0                COMPAQ ST32550N
                                                  IPL

                                                  IPL
</pre>

<p>
To boot from a CD-ROM you need the accompanying Device Path. For instance, if we
want to boot from the TOSHIBA CD-ROM in the above example, we would need to type
the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting from a CD-ROM">
&gt; <i>boot scsi.5.0 ipl</i>

Trying scsi.5.0
</pre>

<p>
The <c>ipl</c> keyword (Initial Program Loader) tells palo (the PA-RISC boot
LOader) to enter interactive mode. This will allow you to change, for example,
the kernel boot parameters.
</p>

<p>
When the boot is successful, palo will start in interactive mode:
</p>

<pre caption="PALO Interactive Mode">
Boot path initialized.
Attempting to load IPL.


Hard booted.
palo ipl 1.2 root@b180l.da-kot Tue Apr  8 12:43:07 CEST 2003

Boot image contains:
    0/vmlinux32 4028015 bytes @ 0x1520000
    0/ramdisk 834748 bytes @ 0xf800
Current command line:
0/vmlinux initrd=initrd.gz TERM=linux console=tty root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc
  0: 0/vmlinux
  1: initrd=initrd.gz
  2: TERM=linux
  3: console=tty
  4: root=/dev/ram0
  5: init=/linuxrc

Edit which field?
(or 'b' to boot with this command line)? 
</pre>

<p>
These parameters are suitable for most situations.
</p>

<p>
If you need extra features you must add the appropriate keyword(s) to the end of
the command line. To add a keyword, edit the last field, add a space and type 
your keyword. The only implemented keyword as of now is <c>cdcache</c> which 
tells the LiveCD to load itself into RAM, allowing you to unmount the CD.
</p>

<pre caption="Adding cdcache as boot option">
(or 'b' to boot with this command line)? <i>5</i>
init=/linuxrc <i>cdcache</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now that you have tweaked your kernel boot params, boot it.
</p>

<pre caption="Booting the kernel">
(or 'b' to boot with this command line)? <i>b</i>
</pre>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Most hppa machines have an onboard ethernet card. Old ones use the lasi driver
which is compiled in the kernel. Newer ones need the tulip driver which is
compiled as a module. To use the latter, you need to load its driver.
</p>

<p>
In the next example, we try to load the <c>tulip</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe tulip</i>
</pre>

</subsection>

<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook (either from-CD or online) during the
installation, make sure you have created a user account (see <uri
link="#useraccounts">Optional: User Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to
go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>links2</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>links2 /mnt/cdrom/docs/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD. You can view it using <c>links2</c>
as well, but only after having completed the <e>Configuring your Network</e>
chapter (otherwise you won't be able to go on the Internet to view the
document):
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>links2 http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-hppa.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
