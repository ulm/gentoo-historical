<title>What is fstab?</title>
<body>

<p>
Under Linux, all partitions used by the system must be listed in
<path>/etc/fstab</path>. This file contains the mountpoints of those partitions
(where they are seen in the file system structure), how they should be mounted
and with what special options (automatically or not, whether users can mount
them or not, etc.)
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Creating /etc/fstab</title>
<body>

<p>
<path>/etc/fstab</path> uses a special syntax. Every line consists of six
fields, separated by whitespace (space(s), tabs or a mixture). Each field has
its own meaning:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  The first field shows the <b>partition</b> described (the path to the device
  file)
</li>
<li>
  The second field shows the <b>mountpoint</b> at which the partition should be
  mounted
</li>
<li>
  The third field shows the <b>filesystem</b> used by the partition
</li>
<li>
  The fourth field shows the <b>mountoptions</b> used by <c>mount</c> when it
  wants to mount the partition. As every filesystem has its own mountoptions,
  you are encouraged to read the mount man page (<c>man mount</c>) for a full
  listing. Multiple mountoptions are comma-separated.
</li>
<li>
  The fifth field is used by <c>dump</c> to determine if the partition needs to
  be <b>dump</b>ed or not. You can generally leave this as <c>0</c> (zero).
</li>
<li>
  The sixth field is used by <c>fsck</c> to determine the order in which 
  filesystems should be <b>check</b>ed if the system wasn't shut down properly. 
  The root filesystem should have <c>1</c> while the rest should have <c>2</c> 
  (or <c>0</c> if a filesystem check isn't necessary).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default <path>/etc/fstab</path> file provided by Gentoo <e>is no valid fstab
file</e>, so start <c>nano</c> (or your favorite editor) to create your 
<path>/etc/fstab</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Opening /etc/fstab">
# <i>nano -w /etc/fstab</i>
</pre>

<p>
Let us take a look at how we write down the options for the <path>/boot</path>
partition. This is just an example, so if your architecture doesn't require a
<path>/boot</path> partition (such as <b>PPC</b>), don't copy it verbatim.
</p>

<p>
In our default x86 partitioning example <path>/boot</path> is the
<path>/dev/hda1</path> partition, with <c>ext2</c> as filesystem. 
It needs to be checked during boot, so we would write down:
</p>

<pre caption="An example /boot line for /etc/fstab">
/dev/hda1   /boot     ext2    defaults        1 2
</pre>

<p>
Some users don't want their <path>/boot</path> partition to be mounted
automatically to improve their system's security. Those people should 
substitute <c>defaults</c> with <c>noauto</c>. This does mean that you need to 
manually mount this partition every time you want to use it.
</p>

<p>
Now, to improve performance, most users would want to add the <c>noatime</c>
option as mountoption, which results in a faster system since access times
aren't registered (you don't need those generally anyway):
</p>

<pre caption="An improved /boot line for /etc/fstab">
/dev/hda1   /boot     ext2    defaults,noatime    1 2
</pre>

<p>
If we continue with this, we would end up with the following three lines (for
<path>/boot</path>, <path>/</path> and the swap partition):
</p>

<pre caption="Three /etc/fstab lines">
/dev/hda1   /boot     ext2    defaults,noatime  1 2
/dev/hda2   none      swap    sw                0 0
/dev/hda3   /         ext3    noatime           0 1
</pre>

<p>
To finish up, you should add a rule for <path>/proc</path>, <c>tmpfs</c>
(required) and for your CD-ROM drive (and of course, if you have other 
partitions or drives, for those too):
</p>

<pre caption="A full /etc/fstab example">
/dev/hda1   /boot     ext2    defaults,noatime     1 2
/dev/hda2   none      swap    sw                   0 0
/dev/hda3   /         ext3    noatime              0 1

none        /proc     proc    defaults             0 0
none        /dev/shm  tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noexec  0 0

/dev/cdroms/cdrom0    /mnt/cdrom    auto      noauto,user    0 0
</pre>

<p>
<c>auto</c> makes <c>mount</c> guess for the filesystem (recommended for 
removable media as they can be created with one of many filesystems) and 
<c>user</c> makes it possible for non-root users to mount the CD.
</p>

<p>
Now use the above example to create your <path>/etc/fstab</path>. If you are a
<b>SPARC</b>-user, you should add the following line to your 
<path>/etc/fstab</path>
too:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding openprom filesystem to /etc/fstab">
none        /proc/openprom  openpromfs    defaults      0 0
</pre>

<p>
If you need <c>usbfs</c>, add the following line to <path>/etc/fstab</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding usbfs filesystem to /etc/fstab">
none        /proc/bus/usb   usbfs         defaults      0 0
</pre>

<p>
Double-check your <path>/etc/fstab</path>, save and quit to continue.
</p>

<title>Networking Information</title>
<subsection>
<title>Hostname, Domainname etc.</title>
<body>

<p>
One of the choices the user has to make is name his/her PC. This seems to be 
quite easy, but <e>lots</e> of users are having difficulties finding the 
appropriate name for their Linux-pc. To speed things up, know that any name you 
choose can be changed afterwards. For all we care, you can just call your system
<c>tux</c> and domain <c>homenetwork</c>. 
</p>

<p>
We use these values in the next examples. First we set the hostname:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the hostname">
# <i>echo tux &gt; /etc/hostname</i>
</pre>

<p>
Second we set the domainname:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the domainname">
# <i>echo homenetwork &gt; /etc/dnsdomainname</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you have a NIS domain (if you don't know what that is, then you don't have
one), you need to define that one too:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the NIS domainname">
# <i>echo nis.homenetwork &gt; /etc/nisdomainname</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now add the <c>domainname</c> script to the default runlevel:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding domainname to the default runlevel">
# <i>rc-update add domainname default</i>
</pre>

<title>Configuring your Network</title>
<body>

<p>
Before you get that "Hey, we've had that already"-feeling, you should remember
that the networking you set up in the beginning of the gentoo installation was 
just for the installation. Right now you are going to configure networking for 
your Gentoo system permanently.
</p>

<p>
All networking information is gathered in <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path>. It uses
a straightforward yet not intuitive syntax if you don't know how to set up
networking manually. But don't fear, we'll explain everything :)
</p>

<p>
First open <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path> with your favorite editor (<c>nano</c>
is used in this example):
</p>

<pre caption="Opening /etc/conf.d/net for editing">
# <i>nano -w /etc/conf.d/net</i>
</pre>

<p>
The first variable you'll find is <c>iface_eth0</c>. It uses the following
syntax:
</p>

<pre caption="iface_eth0 syntaxis">
iface_eth0="<i>&lt;your ip address&gt;</i> broadcast <i>&lt;your broadcast address&gt;</i> netmask <i>&lt;your netmask&gt;</i>"
</pre>

<p>
If you use DHCP (automatic IP retrieval), you should just set <c>iface_eth0</c>
to <c>dhcp</c>. If you use rp-pppoe (e.g. for ADSL), set it to <c>up</c>. 
If you need to set up your network manually and you're 
not familiar with all the above terms, please read the section on <uri
link="?part=1&amp;chap=3#network_term">Understanding Network
Terminology</uri> if you haven't done so already.
</p>

<p>
So let us give three examples; the first one uses DHCP, the second one a static 
IP (192.168.0.2) with netmask 255.255.255.0, broadcast 192.168.0.255 and 
gateway 192.168.0.1 while the third one just activates the interface for
rp-pppoe usage:
</p>

<pre caption="Examples for /etc/conf.d/net">
<comment>(For DHCP)</comment>
iface_eth0="dhcp"
<comment># Some network admins require that you use the</comment>
<comment># hostname and domainname provided by the DHCP server.</comment>
<comment># In that case, add the following to let dhcpcd use them.</comment>
<comment># That will override your own hostname and domainname definitions.</comment>
dhcpcd_eth0="-HD"
<comment># If you intend on using NTP to keep your machine clock synchronized, use</comment>
<comment># the -N option to prevent dhcpcd from overwriting your /etc/ntp.conf file</comment>
dhcpcd_eth0="-N"

<comment>(For static IP)</comment>
iface_eth0="192.168.0.2 broadcast 192.168.0.255 netmask 255.255.255.0"
gateway="eth0/192.168.0.1"

<comment>(For rp-pppoe)</comment>
iface_eth0="up"
</pre>

<p>
If you have several network interfaces, create extra <c>iface_eth</c> variables,
like <c>iface_eth1</c>, <c>iface_eth2</c> etc. The <c>gateway</c> variable
shouldn't be reproduced as you can only set one gateway per computer.
</p>

<p>
Now save the configuration and exit to continue.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Automatically Start Networking at Boot</title>
<body>

<p>
To have your network interfaces activated at boot, you need to add them to the
default runlevel. If you have PCMCIA interfaces you should skip this action as
the PCMCIA interfaces are started by the PCMCIA init script.
</p>

<pre caption="Adding net.eth0 to the default runlevel">
# <i>rc-update add net.eth0 default</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you have several network interfaces, you need to create the appropriate
<path>net.eth1</path>, <path>net.eth2</path> etc. initscripts for those. You can
use <c>ln</c> to do this:
</p>

<pre caption="Creating extra initscripts">
# <i>cd /etc/init.d</i>
# <i>ln -s net.eth0 net.eth1</i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth1 default</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Writing Down Network Information</title>
<body>

<p>
You now need to inform Linux about your network. This is defined in
<path>/etc/hosts</path> and helps in resolving hostnames to IP addresses
for hosts that aren't resolved by your nameserver. For instance, if your 
internal network consists of three PCs called <c>jenny</c> (192.168.0.5), 
<c>benny</c> (192.168.0.6) and <c>tux</c> (192.168.0.7 - this system) you would
open <path>/etc/hosts</path> and fill in the values:
</p>

<pre caption="Opening /etc/hosts">
# <i>nano -w /etc/hosts</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Filling in the networking information">
127.0.0.1     localhost
192.168.0.5   jenny.homenetwork jenny
192.168.0.6   benny.homenetwork benny
192.168.0.7   tux.homenetwork tux
</pre>

<p>
If your system is the only system (or the nameservers handle all name
resolution) a single line is sufficient. For instance, if you want to call your
system <c>tux</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/hosts for lonely or fully integrated PCs">
127.0.0.1     localhost tux
</pre>

<p>
Save and exit the editor to continue.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have PCMCIA, you can now continue with <uri
link="#doc_chap3">System Information</uri>. PCMCIA-users should read the
following topic on PCMCIA.

<title>Optional: Get PCMCIA Working</title>
<body>

<note>
pcmcia-cs is only available for x86, amd64 and ppc platforms.
</note>

<p>
PCMCIA-users should first install the <c>pcmcia-cs</c> package. This also
includes users who will be working with a 2.6 kernel (even though they won't be
using the PCMCIA drivers from this package). The <c>USE="-X"</c> is necessary 
to avoid installing xorg-x11 at this moment:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing pcmcia-cs">
# <i>USE="-X" emerge pcmcia-cs</i>
</pre>

<p>
When <c>pcmcia-cs</c> is installed, add <c>pcmcia</c> to the <e>default</e> 
runlevel:

<p>
First we set the root password by typing:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you want root to be able to log on through the serial console, add 
<c>tts/0</c> to <path>/etc/securetty</path>:
</p>

<title>System Information</title>

<p>
Gentoo uses <path>/etc/rc.conf</path> for general, system-wide configuration.
Open up <path>/etc/rc.conf</path> and enjoy all the comments in that file :)
</p>

<pre caption="Opening /etc/rc.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/rc.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, this file is well commented to help you set up the necessary
configuration variables. Take special care with the <c>KEYMAP</c> setting: if
you select the wrong <c>KEYMAP</c> you will get weird results when typing on
your keyboard.
</p>

<note>
Users of USB-based <b>SPARC</b> systems and <b>SPARC</b> clones might need to 
select an i386 keymap (such as "us") instead of "sunkeymap".
</note>

<p>
<b>PPC</b> uses x86 keymaps on most systems. Users who want to be able to use 
ADB keymaps on boot have to enable ADB keycode sendings in their kernel and have
to set a mac/ppc keymap in <path>rc.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
When you're finished configuring <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>, save and exit, then 
continue with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=9">Installing Necessary System 
Tools</uri>.
