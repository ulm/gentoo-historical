<title>The Gentoo Installation Approaches</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using one of three <e>stage</e> tarball files.
A stage file is a tarball (compressed archive) that contains a minimal
environment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
     A stage1 file contains nothing more than a compiler, Portage (Gentoo's
     software management system) and a couple of packages on which the compiler
     or Portage depends.
   </li>
   <li>
     A stage2 file contains a so-called bootstrapped system, a minimal
     environment from which one can start building all other necessary
     applications that make a Gentoo environment complete.
   </li>
   <li>
     A stage3 file contains a prebuilt minimal system which is almost fully
     deployable. It only lacks a few applications where you, the Gentoo user,
     needs to choose which one you want to install.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
To help you decide what stage file you want to use, we have written down the
major advantages and disadvantages of each stage file.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>A Stage1 Approach</title>
<body>

<p>
A <e>stage1</e> is used when you want to bootstrap and build the entire system 
from scratch.
</p>

<p>
Starting from a stage1 allows you to have total control over the
optimization settings and optional build-time functionality that is
initially enabled on your system. This makes <e>stage1</e> installs good for
power users who know what they are doing. It is also a great
installation method for those who would like to know more about the
inner workings of Gentoo Linux.
</p>

  </ti>

</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>A Stage2 Approach</title>
<body>

<p>
A <e>stage2</e> is used for building the entire system from a bootstrapped
"semi-compiled" state.
</p>

<p>
Stage2 installs allow you to skip the bootstrap process; doing this
is fine if you are happy with the optimization settings that we chose
for your particular stage2 tarball.
</p>

  <ti>You can still tweak your settings</ti>

  <ti>You cannot tweak as much as with a stage1</ti>

  <ti>It's still not the fastest way to install Gentoo</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You have to accept the optimizations we chose for the bootstrap</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>
    Requires a working Internet connection during the installation
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>A Stage3 Approach</title>
<body>

<p>
A <e>stage3</e> installation contains a basic Gentoo Linux system that has been
built for you. You will only need to build a few packages of which we can't
decide for you which one to choose.
</p>

<p>
Choosing to go with a stage3 allows for the fastest install of Gentoo
Linux, but also means that your base system will have the optimization
settings that we chose for you (which to be honest, are good settings
and were carefully chosen to enhance performance while maintaining
stability). Stage3 is also required if you want to install Gentoo using
prebuilt packages or without a network connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Stage3</th>
  <th>Pros and Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>+</th>
  <ti>Fastest way to get a Gentoo base system</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>-</th>
  <ti>You cannot tweak the base system - it's built already</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
You might be interested to know that, if you decide to use different 
optimization settings after having installed Gentoo, you will be able to 
recompile your entire system with the new optimization settings.

<title>The Gentoo Installation CDs</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo Installation CDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All Installation CDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet. We currently provide
two Installation CDs which are equaly suitable to install Gentoo from, as long 
as you're planning on performing an Internet-based installation using the latest
version of the available packages.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to install Gentoo without a working Internet connection, please use
the installation instructions described in the <uri
link="2005.1/index.xml">Gentoo 2005.1 Handbooks</uri>.
</p>

<p>
The two Installation CDs that we currently provide are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Minimal</e> Installation CD, a small, no-nonsense, bootable CD
    which sole purpose is to boot the system, prepare the networking and 
    continue with the Gentoo installation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Universal</e> Installation CD, a bootable CD with the same 
    abilities as the Minimal Installation CD. Additionally, it contains a 
    stage1 and several stage3 tarballs (optimized for the individual 
    subarchitectures). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
We currently only provide Installation CDs for the sparc64 architecture. Users
of sparc32 can use the experimental netboot images to install Gentoo from.
More information about netbooting can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/gentoo-sparc-netboot-howto.xml">Gentoo/SPARC Netboot
HOWTO</uri>.
</p>

<p>
To help you decide which Installation CD you need, we have written down the
major advantages and disadvantages of each Installation CD.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Minimal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Minimal Installation CD is called <c>install-sparc64-minimal-2005.1.iso</c> 
and takes up only 130 MB of diskspace. You can use this Installation CD to 
install Gentoo, but always with a working Internet connection only.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Universal Installation CD is called 
<c>install-sparc-universal-2005.1.iso</c> and consumes the entire surface of a 
650 MB CD. You can use this Installation CD to install
Gentoo, and you can even use it to install Gentoo without a working internet
connection, just in case you want to bring Gentoo to another PC than the one you
are currently installing Gentoo on :)
</p>

<table>

</table>

</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Other CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You might find a so-called <e>Package CD</e> on one of our mirrors. This CD is
no Installation CD but an additional resource that can be exploited during a 
networkless installation. It contains prebuilt packages (the so-called GRP set)
that allows you to easily and quickly install additional applications (such as
OpenOffice.org, KDE, GNOME, ...) immediately after the networkless Gentoo 
installation.

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo Installation CD. We'll first start by 
downloading and burning the chosen Installation CD. We previously discussed 
the several available Installation CDs, but where can you find them?
</p>

<p>
You can download any of the Installation CDs (and, if you want to, a Packages 
CD as well) from one of our <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The
Installation CDs are located in the 
<path>releases/sparc/2005.1/sparc64/installcd</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find so-called ISO-files. Those are full CD images
which you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can check its
MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we provide (such as
<path>install-sparc64-minimal-2005.1.iso.md5</path>). You can check the MD5 
checksum with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public key:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device 
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
Insert the Gentoo Installation CD in the CD-ROM and boot your system. During 
startup, press Stop-A to enter OpenBootPROM (OBP). Once you are in the OBP, 
boot from the CD-ROM:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting the Installation CD">
ok <i>boot cdrom</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted by the SILO boot manager (on the Installation CD). Type in
<c>gentoo-2.4</c> and press enter to continue booting the 
system:
</p>

<pre caption="Continue booting from the Installation CD">
boot: <i>gentoo-2.4</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once the Installation CD is booted, you will be automatically logged on to the
system.
</p>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1.  You will also find a root prompt on the serial
console (<path>ttyS0</path>).
</p>

<p>

</subsection>
<subsection id="hardware">
<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
If not all hardware is supported out-of-the-box, you will need to load the
appropriate kernel modules.
</p>

<p>
In the next example we try to load the <c>8139too</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe 8139too</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook (either from-CD or online) during the
installation, make sure you have created a user account (see <uri
link="#useraccounts">Optional: User Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to
go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>links2</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>links2 /mnt/cdrom/docs/handbook/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD. You can view it using <c>links2</c>
as well, but only after having completed the <e>Configuring your Network</e>
chapter (otherwise you won't be able to go on the Internet to view the
document):
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>links2 http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-sparc.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
