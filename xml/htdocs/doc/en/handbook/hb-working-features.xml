<subsection>
<title>What is DistCC?</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>distcc</c> is a program to distribute compilations across several, not 
necessarily identical, machines on a network. The <c>distcc</c> client sends all
necessary information to the available DistCC servers (running <c>distccd</c>)
so they can compile pieces of sourcecode for the client. The net result is a
faster compilation time.
</p>

<p>
You can find more elaborate information about <c>distcc</c> (and information on
how to have it work with Gentoo) in our <uri link="/doc/en/distcc.xml">Gentoo
Distcc Documentation</uri>.

<title>Installing DistCC</title>
<body>

<p>
Distcc ships with a graphical monitor to monitor tasks that your computer is
sending away for compilation. If you use Gnome then put 'gnome' in your
<c>USE</c> setting. However, if you don't use Gnome and would still like to have
the monitor then you should put 'gtk' in your <c>USE</c> setting.
</p>

<p>
Installing distcc is, as is with all software available through Gentoo's
Portage, extremely easy:
</p>

<note>
From now on, as you now know how to install binary packages if you want, we will
omit the <c>--usepkg</c> option throughout the rest of the Gentoo Handbook.

<title>Activating Portage Support</title>
<body>

<p>
Well, if installation is easy, the rest should be easy too :) So let us quickly
activate the Portage support for <c>distcc</c>.
</p>

<p>
First, open <path>/etc/make.conf</path> and edit the <c>FEATURES</c> variable so
it contains the <c>distcc</c> keyword. Next, edit the <c>MAKEOPTS</c> variable
so it reads <c>-jX</c> with <c>X</c> the number of CPUs that run <c>distccd</c>
(including the current host) plus one:
</p>

<pre caption="Possible MAKEOPTS setting in /etc/make.conf">
<comment># Suppose you have 2 single-CPU distccd hosts excluding this host:</comment>
MAKEOPTS="-j4"
</pre>

<p>
Now, still inside <path>/etc/make.conf</path>, uncomment the
<c>PORTAGE_TMPDIR</c> line and add the following line at the end
of the file:
</p>

<pre caption="Add an extra, distcc-specific variable to /etc/make.conf">
<comment># Don't forget to uncomment the PORTAGE_TMPDIR variable</comment>
DISTCC_DIR=${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage/.distcc
</pre>

<p>
Now run <c>distcc-config</c> and enter the list of available DistCC servers. For
a simple example we assume that the available DistCC servers are
<c>192.168.1.102</c> (the current host), <c>192.168.1.103</c> and 
<c>192.168.1.104</c> (two "remote" hosts):
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring distcc to use three available DistCC servers">
# <i>distcc-config --set-hosts "192.168.1.102 192.168.1.103 192.168.1.104"</i>
</pre>

<p>
Of course, don't forget to run the <c>distccd</c> daemon too:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the distcc daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/distccd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, your system will now use distributed compiling! For more
in-depth information about DistCC and Gentoo, please read our <uri

<title>Creating binary packages</title>
<body>

<p>
We have already discussed how to work with prebuild packages, but how do you
create your own prebuild packages?
</p>

<p>
If the package is already installed, you can use the <c>quickpkg</c> command
which will make a tarball of the installed files. This is very interesting for
backup purposes!
</p>

<pre caption="Using quickpkg">
# <i>quickpkg gnumeric</i>
</pre>

<p>
If the package isn't installed yet, you can install it using <c>emerge</c> and
ask to build a binary package too. <c>emerge</c> uses the <c>--buildpkg</c>
option (<c>-b</c> in short) for this:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing gnumeric and building binary packages too">
# <i>emerge --buildpkg gnumeric</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you want Portage to do this by default, you should set the <c>buildpkg</c>
keyword in the <c>FEATURES</c> variable declared in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to install the software, but only build the package, you can
use the <c>--buildpkgonly</c> option (<c>-B</c> in short):
</p>

<pre caption="Building a binary package for gnumeric">
# <i>emerge --buildpkgonly gnumeric</i>
