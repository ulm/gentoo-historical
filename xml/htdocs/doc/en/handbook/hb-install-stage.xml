<title>Choosing the Right Stage</title>
<body>

<p>
When we asked you to choose for an installation medium (LiveCDs, existing
distribution etc.) we explained you what the pros and cons are. One of those was
choosing your stage: do you go for a full compilation (<e>stage1</e>), skip the
bootstrapping (<e>stage2</e>) or start from a precompiled stade (<e>stage3</e>)?
</p>

<p>
Depending on your installation medium, you can still make your choice. Others
will already have made the choice at the beginning of the installation. It is
now time to install your choice of stage. But first we'll configure Portage with
the compiler optimizations you want and feature support you need.

changing <e>CHOST</e> (only for Stage1). Edit
