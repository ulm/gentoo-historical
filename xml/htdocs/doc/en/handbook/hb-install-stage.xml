<title>Choosing the Right Stage</title>
<body>

<p>
When we asked you to choose for an installation medium (LiveCDs, existing
distribution etc.) we explained you what the pros and cons are. One of those was
choosing your stage: do you go for a full compilation (<e>stage1</e>), skip the
bootstrapping (<e>stage2</e>) or start from a precompiled stade (<e>stage3</e>)?
</p>

<p>
Depending on your installation medium, you can still make your choice. Others
will already have made the choice at the beginning of the installation. It is
now time to install your choice of stage. But first we'll configure Portage with
the compiler optimizations you want and feature support you need.

<title>Introduction</title>

<p>
To optimize Gentoo, you can set a couple of variables which impact Portage 
behaviour. All those variables can be set as environment variables (using
<c>export</c>) but that isn't permanent. To keep your settings, Portage provides
you with <path>/etc/make.conf</path>, a configuration file for Portage. It is
this file we will edit now. 
</p>

<p>
Fire up your favorite editor (in this guide we use <c>nano</c>) so we can alter
the optimization variables we will discuss hereafter.
</p>

<pre caption="Opening /etc/make.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/make.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
As you probably notice now, the <path>make.conf</path> file is structured in a
generic way: commented lines start with "#", other lines define variables using
the <c>VARIABLE="content"</c> syntax. Several of those variables are discussed
next.

<title>CHOST</title>

<warn>
Although it might be interesting for non-stage1 users, they should <e>not</e>
change the <c>CHOST</c> setting in <path>make.conf</path>. Doing so might render
their system unusable.
