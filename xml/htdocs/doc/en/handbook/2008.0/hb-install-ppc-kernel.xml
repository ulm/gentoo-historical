<title>Timezone</title>

<p>
You first need to select your timezone so that your system knows where it is
located. Look for your timezone in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>, then copy
it to <path>/etc/localtime</path>. Please avoid the
<path>/usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT*</path> timezones as their names do not
indicate the expected zones. For instance, <path>GMT-8</path> is in fact
GMT+8.
</p>

<title>Choosing a Kernel</title>
<body>

<p>
The core around which all distributions are built is the Linux kernel. It is the
layer between the user programs and your system hardware. Gentoo provides its
users several possible kernels to choose from. A full listing with description 
is available at the 
<uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-kernel.xml">Gentoo Kernel Guide</uri>. 
</p>

<p>
We suggest using <c>gentoo-sources</c> on PPC, which is a recent 2.6 kernel.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing a kernel source">
# <i>emerge --usepkg gentoo-sources</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you take a look in <path>/usr/src</path> you should see a symlink named
<path>linux</path> pointing to your current kernel source. In this case, the
installed kernel source points to <c>gentoo-sources-<keyval
id="kernel-version"/></c>. Your version may be different, so keep this in mind.
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the kernel source symlink">
# <i>ls -l /usr/src/linux</i>
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           22  Mar 18 16:23 /usr/src/linux -&gt; linux-<keyval id="kernel-gentoo"/>
</pre>

<p>
Now it is time to configure and compile your kernel source. You can use 
<c>genkernel</c> for this, which will build a generic kernel as used by the 
Installation CD. We explain the "manual" configuration first though, as it is
a more efficient configuration.
</p>

<p>
If you want to manually configure your kernel, continue now with <uri
link="#manual">Default: Manual Configuration</uri>. If you want to use 
<c>genkernel</c> you should read <uri link="#genkernel">Alternative: Using 
genkernel</uri> instead.

<title>Default: Manual Configuration</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Manually configuring a kernel is often seen as the most difficult procedure a
Linux user ever has to perform. Nothing is less true -- after configuring a
few kernels you won't even remember that it was difficult ;)
</p>

<p>
However, one thing <e>is</e> true: you must know your system when you start
configuring a kernel manually. Most information can be gathered by emerging 
pciutils (<c>emerge --usepkg pciutils</c>) which contains the program 
<c>lspci</c>. You will now be able to use <c>lspci</c> within the chrooted
environment. You may safely ignore any <e>pcilib</e> warnings (such as pcilib:
cannot open /sys/bus/pci/devices) that <c>lspci</c> throws out. Alternatively,
you can run <c>lspci</c> from a <e>non-chrooted</e> environment. The results
are the same. You can also run <c>lsmod</c> to see what kernel modules the 
Installation CD uses (it might provide you with a nice hint on what to enable).
Another place to look for clues as to what components to enable is to check the
kernel message logs from the successful boot that got you this far.  Type
<c>dmesg</c> to see these kernel messages.
</p>

<p>
Now, go to your kernel source directory, it's time to configure your kernel.
Start by configuring a kernel that will boot on most 32 Bit PowerPC machines
by first running <c>make pmac32_defconfig</c>. After the default configuration
has been generated, run <c>make menuconfig</c> to start an ncurses-based
configuration menu.
</p>

<pre caption="Invoking menuconfig">
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make pmac32_defconfig</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted with several configuration sections. We'll first list some
options you must activate (otherwise Gentoo will not function, or not function
properly without additional tweaks).
</p>

</body>

<title>Activating Required Options</title>
<body>

<p>
First go to <c>File Systems</c> and select support for the filesystems you use.
<e>Don't</e> compile them as modules, otherwise your Gentoo system will not be
able to mount your partitions. Also select the <c>/proc file system</c> and
<c>Virtual memory</c>.  Make sure that you also enable support for Amiga
partitions if you are using a Pegasos, or Macintosh partitions if you are using
an Apple computer.
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting necessary file systems">

  &lt;*&gt; Second extended fs support

</pre>

<p>
Users of NewWorld and OldWorld machines will want HFS support as well.  OldWorld
users require it for copying compiled kernels to the MacOS partition. NewWorld
users require it for configuring the special Apple_Bootstrap partition:

<p>
If you are using PPPoE to connect to the Internet or you are using a dial-up
modem, you will need the following options in the kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting PPPoE necessary drivers">
Device Drivers ---&gt;

</pre>

<p>
The two compression options won't harm but are not always needed.  The <c>PPP
over Ethernet</c> option might only be used by <c>ppp</c> when configured to
perform kernel mode PPPoE.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to include support in the kernel for your ethernet card!  Most
newer Apple computers use the SunGEM ethernet driver.  Older iMacs commonly use
the BMAC driver.
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting the network driver">

      &lt;*&gt;   Sun GEM support
</pre>

<p>
At this time, full kernel preemption may still be unstable on PPC and may cause
compilation failures and random segfaults.  It is <e>strongly</e> suggested
that you do not use this feature.  Both <e>Voluntary Preemption</e> and 
<e>No Forced Preemption</e> should be safe.

<p>
If you're booting from Firewire, you'll need to enable these options. If you do
not want to compile in support, you'll need to include these modules and their
dependencies in an initrd.
</p>

<p>
If you're booting from USB, you'll need to enable these options.  If you do not
want to compile in support, you'll need to include these modules and their
dependencies in an initrd.
</p>

<p>
Do not turn off kernel framebuffer support as it is required for a successful
boot.  If you are using an NVIDIA based chipset, you should use the Open Firmware
framebuffer.  If you are using an ATI based chipset, you should select the
framebuffer driver based upon your chipset (Mach64, Rage128 or Radeon).
</p>

</pre>

<note>
If you select more than one framebuffer device, it may default to a less than
optimal driver.  Either use only one framebuffer device or specify which
to use by passing the driver to use to the kernel on boot by appending a video
line such as: <c>video=radeonfb</c>.
</note>

When you're done configuring your kernel, continue with <uri

<p>
Now that your kernel is configured, it is time to compile and install it. Exit 
the configuration menu and run the following commands:
</p>

<pre caption="Compiling the kernel">
# <i>make &amp;&amp; make modules_install</i>
</pre>

<p>
When the kernel has finished compiling, copy the kernel image to
<path>/boot</path> as shown below. If you have a separate boot partition, as
on Pegasos computers, be sure that it is mounted properly. If you are using 
BootX to boot, we'll copy the kernel later.
</p>

<p>
Yaboot and BootX expect to use an uncompressed kernel unlike many other
bootloaders. The uncompressed kernel is called vmlinux and it is placed in
<path>/usr/src/linux</path> after the kernel has finished compiling. If you are
using a Pegasos machine, the Pegasos firmware requires a compressed kernel
called zImage which can be found in
<path>/usr/src/linux/arch/powerpc/boot/images</path>.
</p>

<title>Configuring the Modules</title>
<body>

<p>
You should list the modules you want automatically loaded in
<path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path>. You can add extra options to
the modules if required.
</p>

<p>
To view all available modules, run the following <c>find</c> command. Don't
forget to substitute "&lt;kernel version&gt;" with the version of the kernel you
just compiled:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing all available modules">
# <i>find /lib/modules/&lt;kernel version&gt;/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko'</i>
</pre>

<p>
For instance, to automatically load the <c>3c59x</c> module, edit the
<path>kernel-2.6</path> file and add the module to it, one module on a line.
</p>

<pre caption="Editing /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6">

<section id="genkernel">
<title>Alternative: Using genkernel</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your kernel source tree is installed, it's now time to compile your
kernel by using our <c>genkernel</c> script to automatically build a kernel for
you. <c>genkernel</c> works by configuring a kernel nearly identically to the
way our Installation CD kernel is configured. This means that when you use
<c>genkernel</c> to build your kernel, your system will generally detect all
your hardware at boot-time, just like our Installation CD does. Because
genkernel doesn't require any manual kernel configuration, it is an ideal
solution for those users who may not be comfortable compiling their own
kernels.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's see how to use genkernel. First, emerge the genkernel ebuild:
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging genkernel">
# <i>emerge --usepkg genkernel</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, copy over the kernel configuration used by the Installation CD to the 
location where genkernel looks for the default kernel configuration:
</p>

<pre caption="Copying over the Installation CD kernel config">
# <i>zcat /proc/config.gz > /usr/share/genkernel/ppc/kernel-config-2.6</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you are using firewire or USB to boot, you'll need to add modules to the 
initrd.  Edit <path>/usr/share/genkernel/ppc/modules_load</path> and change
<c>MODULES_FIREWIRE="ieee1394 ohci1394 sbp2"</c> for firewire support or
<c>MODULES_USB="usbcore ohci-hcd ehci-hcd usb-storage"</c> for USB support.
</p>

<p>
Before compiling your sources, the fstab needs a slight adjustment. The rest of
the fstab will be completed during a later step, so don't worry about the
details now. If you did not create a separate boot partition (NOT bootstrap,
that's different), remove the line referencing <path>/boot</path> from
<path>/etc/fstab</path>. This will need to be done on most Apple computers.
</p>

<pre caption="Removing /boot from /etc/fstab on machines without a boot partition">
# <i>nano -w /etc/fstab</i>
<comment>Remove this line</comment>
/dev/BOOT		/boot		ext2		noauto,noatime	1 2
</pre>

<p>
Now, compile your kernel sources by running <c>genkernel --genzimage all</c>.
For Pegasos, we will need to use a different config and create a zImage instead
of the vmlinux kernel used on Apple machines. Be aware, as <c>genkernel</c> 
compiles a kernel that supports almost all hardware, this compilation can take 
quite a while to finish!
</p>

<p>
Note that, if your partition where the kernel should be located doesn't use ext2
or ext3 as filesystem you might need to manually configure your kernel using
<c>genkernel --menuconfig all</c> and add support for your 
filesystem <e>in</e> the kernel (i.e. <e>not</e> as a module). Users of EVMS2 or
LVM2 will probably want to add <c>--evms2</c> or <c>--lvm2</c> as an argument as
well.
</p>

<pre caption="Running genkernel">
# <i>genkernel all</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Running genkernel on the Pegasos">
# <i>genkernel --genzimage --kernel-config=/usr/share/genkernel/ppc/Pegasos all</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once <c>genkernel</c> completes, a kernel, full set of modules and 
<e>initial root disk</e> (initrd) will be created. We will use the kernel 
and initrd when configuring a boot loader later in this document. Write
down the names of the kernel and initrd as you will need them when writing
the bootloader configuration file. The initrd will be started immediately after 
booting to perform hardware autodetection (just like on the Installation CD) 
before your "real" system starts up.  Be sure to also copy down the required
boot arguments, these are required for a successful boot with genkernel.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the created kernel image name and initrd">
<comment>Note, your kernel version might be different</comment>
# <i>ls /boot/kernel-genkernel-ppc-<keyval id="kernel-gentoo"/> /boot/initramfs-genkernel-ppc-<keyval id="kernel-gentoo"/></i>
