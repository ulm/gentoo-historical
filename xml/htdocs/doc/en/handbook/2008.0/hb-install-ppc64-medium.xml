<title>The Gentoo Universal Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using a <e>stage3</e> tarball file.
Such a tarball is an archive that contains a minimal environment from
which you can succesfully install Gentoo Linux onto your system.
</p>

<p>
Installations using a stage1 or stage2 tarball file are not documented in the
Gentoo Handbook - please read the <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">Gentoo
FAQ</uri> on these matters.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>
  
<p> 
An Installation CD is a bootable medium which contains a self-sustained Gentoo
environment. It allows you to boot Linux from the CD. During the boot process
your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers are loaded. The Gentoo
Installation CDs are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
There currently are two Installation CDs available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Universal Installation CD contains everything you need to install
    Gentoo. It provides stage3 files for common architectures, source code
    for the extra applications you need to choose from and, of course, the
    installation instructions for your architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Minimal Installation CD contains only a minimal environment that allows
    you to boot up and configure your network so you can connect to the
    Internet. It does not contain any additional files and cannot be used
    during the current installation approach.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Gentoo also provides a Package CD. This is not an Installation CD but an
additional resource that you can exploit during the installation of your Gentoo
system. It contains prebuilt packages (also known as the GRP set) that allow
you to easily and quickly install additional applications immediately after the
Gentoo installation and right before you update your Portage tree.
</p>

<p>
The use of the Package CD is covered later in this document.
</p>

<title>Choosing a userland</title>
<body>

<p>
On PPC64, the kernel is 64-bit and the <e>userland</e> can be 32-bit or 64-bit. The
userland is basically the applications you are running, such as
<c>bash</c> or <c>mozilla-firefox</c>. They can be compiled and run in either
64-bit or 32-bit modes. The Gentoo/PPC64 team provides both 32-bit and 64-bit
userlands, so which one should you use?
</p>

<p>
You may have heard that 64-bit applications are better, but in fact, 32-bit
applications take up slightly less memory and often run a little bit faster than
64-bit applications.
</p>

<p>
You really only need 64-bit applications when you need more memory than a 32-bit
userland allows, or if you do a lot of 64-bit number crunching. If you run
applications that require more than 4GB of memory or you run scientific
applications, you should choose the 64-bit userland. Otherwise, choose the
32-bit userland, as it is recommended by the Gentoo/PPC64 developers.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the 32-bit userland has been available in Portage longer than the
64-bit userland has. This means that there are more applications tested in the
32-bit userland that just work "out of the box." Many applications compiled for
the 64-bit userland may be just as stable as the 32-bit version, but they
haven't been tested yet. Though testing isn't difficult to do, it can be
annoying and time consuming if you want to use many untested 64-bit
applications. Also, some programs just won't run in the 64-bit userland until
their code is fixed, such as OpenOffice.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo/PPC64 team provides stages and Package CDs for both 32-bit and 64-bit
userlands, so no matter which one you choose, you'll be able to successfully
install Gentoo and get a full system up and running with minimal fuss.

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You can download the Universal Installation CD (and, if you want to, the
Packages CD as well) from one of our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located in
the <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>installcd</path> directory; the Package CDs
are located in the <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>packagecd</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside those directories you'll find ISO files. Those are full CD images which
you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
After downloading the file, you can verify its integrity to see if it is
corrupted or not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we
    provide (for instance with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or
    <uri link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows).  How
    to verify MD5 checksums with Mac OS X is described in the <uri
    link="/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-faq.xml#doc_chap1">Gentoo PPC FAQ</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can verify the cryptographic signature that we provide. You need to
    obtain the public key we use (0x17072058) before you proceed though.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To fetch our public key using the GnuPG application, run the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>
    
<p> 
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>Burn CD Image</c>. Then you can locate
    your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Booting the Installation CD on an Apple</title>
<body>

<p>
Please check the <path>README.kernel</path> on the Installation CD for the
latest information on how to boot various kernels and getting hardware support.
</p>

<p>
Place the Installation CD in the CD-ROM and reboot the system. Hold down the 
'C' key at bootup. You will be greeted by a friendly welcome message and a 
<e>boot:</e> prompt at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p>
You are also able to tweak some kernel options at this prompt. The following
table lists the available boot options you can add:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Boot Option</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>video</c></ti>
  <ti>
    This option takes one of the following vendor-specific tags:
    <c>radeonfb</c>, <c>rivafb</c>, <c>atyfb</c>, <c>aty128</c>, <c>nvidiafb</c>
    or <c>ofonly</c>. You can follow this tag with the resolution and
    refreshrate you want to use. For instance
    <c>video=radeonfb:1280x1024@75</c>. If you are uncertain what to choose,
    <c>ofonly</c> will most certainly work.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>nol3</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Disables level 3 cache on some powerbooks (needed for at least the 17")
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>debug</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Enables verbose booting, spawns an initrd shell that can be used to debug
    the Installation CD
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>sleep=X</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Wait X seconds before continuing; this can be needed by some very old SCSI
    CD-ROMs which don't speed up the CD quick enough
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>bootfrom=X</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Boot from a different device
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
At this prompt, hit enter, and a complete Gentoo Linux environment will be
loaded from the CD. Continue with <uri link="#booted">And When You're
Booted...</uri>.

<title>Booting the Installation CD on an IBM pSeries, OpenPower and Power5
iSeries servers</title>
<body>

<p>
Please check the <path>README.kernel</path> on the Installation CD for the
latest information on how to boot various kernels and getting hardware support.
</p>

<p>
Most modern pSeries servers can boot from the CDROM drive through SMS ('1' when
the “IBM IBM IBM” messages flash across the console). On some older  pSeries
boxes, sometimes the cds might not autoboot. You might have to set up your
cdrom as a bootable device in the multi-boot menu. (F1 at startup) The other
option is to jump into OF and do it from there:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Boot into OF  (this is 8 from the serial cons or F8 from a graphics
    cons, start hitting the key when you see the keyboard mouse etc etc
    messages.
  </li>
  <li>Run the command 0> boot cdrom:1,yaboot</li>
  <li>Stand back and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="booted">
<title>And When You're Booted...</title>
<body>

<p>
You will be greeted by a root ("#") prompt on the current console. You can also 
switch to other consoles by pressing Alt-fn-F2, Alt-fn-F3 and Alt-fn-F4. Get 
back to the one you started on by pressing Alt-fn-F1.
</p>

<p>
If you are installing Gentoo on a system with a non-US keyboard, use
<c>loadkeys</c> to load the keymap for your keyboard. To list the available
keymaps, execute <c>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Listing available keymaps">
<comment>(PPC uses x86 keymaps on most systems)</comment>
# <i>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now load the keymap of your choice:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading a keymap">
# <i>loadkeys be-latin1</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware Configuration</uri>.
