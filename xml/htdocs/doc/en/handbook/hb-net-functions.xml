<title>Standard function hooks</title>

<p>
Four functions can be defined which will be called surrounding the
start/stop operations.  The functions are called with the interface
name first so that one function can control multiple adapters.
</p>

<p>
The return values for the preup and predown functions should be 0
(success) to indicate that configuration or deconfiguration of the
interface can continue.  If preup returns a non-zero value, then
interface configuration will be aborted.  If predown returns a
non-zero value, then the interface will not be allowed to continue
deconfiguration.
</p>

<p>
The return values for the postup and postdown functions are ignored
since there's nothing to do if they indicate failure.
</p>

<p>
<c>${IFACE}</c> is set to the interface being brought up/down. 
<c>${IFVAR}</c> is <c>${IFACE}</c> converted to variable name bash allows
</p>

<note>
This will not work with WPA Supplicant - but the <c>${ESSID}</c> and
<c>${ESSIDVAR}</c> variables are available in the postup() function

<p>
Two functions can be defined which will be called surrounding the
associate function.  The functions are called with the interface
name first so that one function can control multiple adapters.
</p>

<p>
The return values for the preassociate function should be 0
(success) to indicate that configuration or deconfiguration of the
interface can continue.  If preassociate returns a non-zero value, then
interface configuration will be aborted.
</p>

<p>
The return value for the postassociate function is ignored
since there's nothing to do if it indicates failure.

<p>
<c>${ESSID}</c> is set to the exact ESSID of the AP you're connecting to.
