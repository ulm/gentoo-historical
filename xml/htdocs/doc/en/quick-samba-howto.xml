<title>Introduction to this HOWTO</title>
<section>
<title>Purpose</title>
<body>

<p>
This HOWTO is designed to help you move a network from many different 
clients speaking different languages, to many different machines that 
speak a common language.  The ultimate goal is to help differing
architectures and technologies, come together in a productive, 
happily coexisting environment.
</p>

<p>
Following the directions outlined in this HOWTO should give you an 
excellent step towards a peaceful cohabitation between Windows, and 
virtually all known variations of *nix.
</p>

<p>
This HOWTO originally started not as a HOWTO, but as a FAQ.  It was 
intended to explore the functionality and power of the Gentoo system, 
portage and the flexibility of USE flags.  Like so many other projects, 
it was quickly discovered what was missing in the Gentoo realm: there 
weren't any Samba HOWTO's catered for Gentoo users.  These users are 
more demanding than most; they require performance, flexibility and 
customization.  This does not however imply that this HOWTO was not 
intended for other distributions; rather that it was designed to work 
with a highly customized version of Samba.
</p>

<p>
This HOWTO will describe how to share files and printers between Windows 
PCs and *nix PCs.  It will also demonstrate the use of the VFS (Virtual 
File System) feature of Samba to incorporate automatic virus protection.  
As a finale, it will show you how to mount and manipulate shares.
</p>

<p>
There are a few topics that will be mentioned, but are out of the 
scope of this HOWTO.  These will be noted as they are presented.
</p>

<p>
This HOWTO is based on a compilation and merge of an excellent HOWTO
provided in the <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo forums</uri>
by Andreas "daff" Ntaflos and the collected knowledge of Joshua Preston.  
The link to this discussion is provided below for your reference:

<title>Before you use this guide</title>
<body>

<p>
There are a several other guides for setting up CUPS and/or Samba, please read
them as well, as they may tell you things left out of this HOWTO (intentional
or otherwise).  One such document is the very useful and well written <uri
link="/doc/en/printing-howto.xml">Gentoo Printing Guide</uri>, as configuration
issues and specific printer setup is not discussed here.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Brief Overview</title>
<body>

<p>
After presenting the various USE flags, the following list will outline 
all of the topics covered as they are presented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the Samba server:
    <ul>
      <li>Install and configure ClamAV</li>
      <li>Install and configure Samba</li>
      <li>Install and configure CUPS</li>
      <li>Adding the printer to CUPS</li>
      <li>Adding the PS drivers for the Windows clients</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the Unix clients:
    <ul>
      <li>Install and configure CUPS</li>
      <li>Configuring a default printer</li>
      <li>Mounting a Windows or Samba share</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the Windows Clients:
    <ul>
       <li>Configuring the printer</li>
       <li>Accessing Samba shares</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Requirements</title>
<body>

<p>
We will need the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>net-fs/samba</li>
  <li>app-antivirus/clamav</li>
  <li>net-print/cups</li>
  <li>net-print/foomatic</li>
  <li>net-print/hpijs (if you have an HP printer)</li>
  <li>A kernel of sorts (preferably 2.4.24+ or 2.6.x)</li>
  <li>A printer (PS or non-PS, maybe not TOO new or fancy)</li>
  <li>
    A working network (home/office/etc) consisting of more than one machine)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The main package we use here is net-fs/samba, however, you will need
a kernel with smbfs support enabled in order to mount a samba or windows 
share from another computer. CUPS will be emerged if it is not already.  
app-antivirus/clamav will be used also, but others should be easily adapted 
to work with Samba. Gentoo's samba ebuild supports all kinds of virus scanning
technologies, such as Sophos, FProt, Fsav, Trend, Icap, Nai, ...

<section>
<title>The USE Flags</title>
<body>

<p>
Before emerging anything, take a look at the various USE flags
available to Samba.
</p>

<pre caption="Samba uses the following USE Variables:">
kerberos mysql xml acl cups ldap pam readline python oav libclamav
</pre>

<p>
Depending on the network topology and the specific requirements of 
the server, the USE flags outlined below will define what to include or 
exclude from the emerging of Samba.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th><b>USE flag</b></th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>kerberos</b></th>
  <ti>
    Include support for Kerberos.  The server will need this if it is 
    intended to join an existing domain or Active Directory.  See the note 
    below for more information.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>mysql</b></th>
  <ti>
    This will allow Samba to use MySQL in order to do password authentication.
    It will store ACLs, usernames, passwords, etc in a database versus a 
    flat file.  If Samba is needed to do password authentication, such as 
    acting as a password validation server or a Primary Domain Controller 
    (PDC).
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>xml</b></th>
  <ti>
    The xml USE option for Samba provides a password database backend allowing
    Samba to store account details in XML files, for the same reasons listed in 
    the mysql USE flag description.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>acl</b></th>
  <ti>
    Enables Access Control Lists. The ACL support in Samba uses a patched
    ext2/ext3, or SGI's XFS in order to function properly as it extends more 
    detailed access to files or directories; much more so than typical *nix 
    GID/UID schemas.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>cups</b></th>
  <ti>
    This enables support for the Common Unix Printing System.  This 
    provides an interface allowing local CUPS printers to be shared to 
    other systems in the network.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>ldap</b></th>
  <ti>
    Enables the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  If Samba is 
    expected to use Active Directory, this option must be used. This would 
    be used in the event Samba needs to login to or provide login to 
    a Domain/Active Directory Server.  The kerberos USE flag is needed for 
    proper functioning of this option.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>pam</b></th>
  <ti>
    Include support for pluggable authentication modules (PAM).  This 
    provides the ability to authenticate users on the Samba Server, which is 
    required if users have to login to your server.  The kerberos USE flag 
    is recommended along with this option.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>readline</b></th>
  <ti>
    Link Samba against libreadline.  This is highly recommended and should
    probably not be disabled
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>python</b></th>
  <ti>
    Python bindings API.  Provides an API that will allow Python to
    interface with Samba.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>oav</b></th>
  <ti>
    Provides on-access scanning of Samba shares with FRISK F-Prot
    Daemon, Kaspersky AntiVirus, OpenAntiVirus.org ScannerDaemon, Sophos Sweep
    (SAVI), Symantec CarrierScan, and Trend Micro (VSAPI).
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>libclamav</b></th>
  <ti>
    Use the ClamAV library instead of the clamd daemon
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
A couple of things worth mentioning about the USE flags and different
Samba functions include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    ACLs on ext2/3 are implemented through extended attributes (EAs). EA and 
    ACL kernel options for ext2 and/or ext3 will need to be enabled 
    (depending on which file system is being used - both can be enabled).
  </li>
  <li>
    While Active Directory, ACL, and PDC functions are out of the intended
    scope of this HOWTO, you may find these links as helpful to your cause:

<title>Emerging Samba</title>
<body>

<p>
First of all: be sure that all your hostnames resolve correctly.
Either have a working domain name system running on your network
or appropriate entries in your <path>/etc/hosts</path> file.
<c>cupsaddsmb</c> often borks if hostnames don't point to the correct
machines.  
</p>

<p>
Hopefully now you can make an assessment of what you'll actually need in
order to use Samba with your particular setup.  The setup used for this 
HOWTO is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>oav</li>
  <li>cups</li>
  <li>readline</li>
  <li>pam</li>
</ul>

<p>
To optimize performance, size and the time of the build, the 
USE flags are specifically included or excluded.
</p>

<pre caption="Emerge Samba">
# <i>echo "net-fs/samba oav readline cups pam" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.use</i>
# <i>emerge net-fs/samba</i>
</pre>

<note>
The following archs will need to add <e>~</e> to their <e>KEYWORDS</e>: x86, 
ppc, sparc, hppa, ia64 and alpha
</note>

<p>
This will emerge Samba and CUPS (if CUPS is not already emerged).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Emerging ClamAV</title>
<body>

<p>
Because the <e>oav</e> USE flag only provides an interface to allow on access 
virus scanning, the actual virus scanner must be emerged.  The scanner
used in this HOWTO is ClamAV.
</p>

<pre caption="Emerge Clamav">
# <i>emerge app-antivirus/clamav</i>

<title>Server Configuration</title>
<section>
<title>Configuring Samba</title>
<body>

<p>
The main Samba configuration file is <path>/etc/samba/smb.conf</path>.
It is divided in sections indicated by [sectionname]. Comments are either 
# or ;.  A sample <path>smb.conf</path> is included below with comments and 
suggestions for modifications.  If more details are required, see the 
man page for <path>smb.conf</path>, the installed
<path>smb.conf.example</path>, the Samba Web site or any of the
numerous Samba books available.

</pre>

<warn>
If you like to use Samba's guest account to do anything concerning
printing from Windows clients: don't set <c>guest only = yes</c> in
the <c>[global]</c> section.  The guest account seems to cause
problems when running <c>cupsaddsmb</c> sometimes when trying to
connect from Windows machines. See below, too, when we talk about
<c>cupsaddsmb</c> and the problems that can arise. Use a dedicated
printer user, like <c>printeruser</c> or <c>printer</c> or
<c>printme</c> or whatever. It doesn't hurt and it will certainly
protect you from a lot of problems.
</warn>

<warn>
Turning on ClamAV on access scanning in the <c>[global]</c> section will slow
down the performance of your Samba server dramatically.
</warn>

<p>
Now create the directories required for the minimum configuration of 
Samba to share the installed printer throughout the network.
</p>

<pre caption="Create the directories">
# <i>mkdir /etc/samba/printer</i>
# <i>mkdir /var/spool/samba</i>
# <i>mkdir /home/samba/public</i>
</pre>

<p>
At least one Samba user is required in order to install the printer 
drivers and to allow users to connect to the printer. Users must
exist in the system's <path>/etc/passwd</path> file.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the users">
# <i>smbpasswd -a root</i> 

<comment>(If another user is to be a printer admin)</comment>
# <i>smbpasswd -a username</i>
</pre>

<p>
The Samba passwords need not be the same as the system passwords 
in <path>/etc/passwd</path>.
</p>

<p>
You will also need to update <path>/etc/nsswitch.conf</path> so that Windows
systems can be found easily using NetBIOS:
</p>

<pre caption="Editing /etc/nsswitch.conf">

<title>Configuring ClamAV</title>
<body>

<p>
The configuration file specified to be used in <path>smb.conf</path> is 
<path>/etc/samba/vscan-clamav.conf</path>.  While these options are set 
to the defaults, the infected file action may need to be changed.
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/samba/vscan-clamav.conf">

<p>
It is generally a good idea to start the virus scanner immediately.  Add 
it to the <e>default</e> runlevel and then start the <c>clamd</c> service 
immediately. The service has two processes: freshclam keeps the virus definition
database up to date while clamd is the actual anti-virus daemon. First you may 
want to set the paths of the logfiles so that it fits your needs.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the location of the logfiles">

<section>
<title>Configuring CUPS</title>
<body>

<p>
This is a little more complicated. CUPS' main config file is 
<path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path>. It's structure is similar to Apache's 
<path>httpd.conf</path> file, so many you may find it familiar. Outlined 
in the example are the directives that need to be changed:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/cups/cupsd.conf">

</pre>

<p>

<title>Installing a printer for and with CUPS</title>
<body>

<p>
First, go to <uri link="http://linuxprinting.org">LinuxPrinting.Org</uri> to
find and download the correct PPD file for your printer and CUPS. To do so,
click the link Printer Listings to the left. Select your printers manufacturer
and the model in the pulldown menu, eg HP and DeskJet 930C. Click "Show". On
the page coming up click the "recommended driver" link after reading the
various notes and information. Then fetch the PPD file from the next page,
again after reading the notes and introductions there. You may have to select
your printers manufacturer and model again. Reading the <uri
link="http://www.linuxprinting.org/cups-doc.html">CUPS quickstart guide</uri>
is also very helpful when working with CUPS.
</p>

<p>
Now you have a PPD file for your printer to work with CUPS. Place it in 
<path>/usr/share/cups/model</path>. The PPD for the HP DeskJet 930C was 
named <path>HP-DeskJet_930C-hpijs.ppd</path>. You should now install the printer.  
This can be done via the CUPS web interface or via command line. The web 
interface is found at <path>http://PrintServer:631</path> once CUPS is running.
</p>

<pre caption="Install the printer via command line">
# <i>lpadmin -p HPDeskJet930C -E -v usb:/dev/ultp0 -m HP-DeskJet_930C-hpijs.ppd</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/cupsd restart</i>
</pre>

<p>
Remember to adjust to what you have. Be sure to have the name
(<c>-p</c> argument) right (the name you set above during the Samba
configuration!) and to put in the correct <c>usb:/dev/usb/blah</c>,
<c>parallel:/dev/blah</c> or whatever device you are using for your
printer.
</p>

<p>
You should now be able to access the printer from the web interface
and be able to print a test page.

<title>Installing the Windows printer drivers</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that the printer should be working it is time to install the drivers 
for the Windows clients to work. Samba 2.2 introduced this functionality.
Browsing to the print server in the Network Neighbourhood, right-clicking
on the printershare and selecting "connect" downloads the appropriate
drivers automagically to the connecting client, avoiding the hassle of 
manually installing printer drivers locally.
</p>

<p>
There are two sets of printer drivers for this. First, the Adobe PS 
drivers which can be obtained from <uri 
link="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/main.html">Adobe</uri> 
(PostScript printer drivers). Second, there are the CUPS PS drivers, 
to be obtained from <uri link="http://www.cups.org/software.php">the 
CUPS homepage</uri> and selecting "CUPS Driver for Windows" from the 
pull down menu. There doesn't seem to be a difference between the
functionality of the two, but the Adobe PS drivers need to be extracted
on a Windows System since it's a Windows binary. Also the whole procedure
of finding and copying the correct files is a bit more hassle. The CUPS
drivers seem to support some options the Adobe drivers don't.
</p>

<p>
This HOWTO uses the CUPS drivers for Windows. The downloaded file is 
called <path>cups-samba-5.0rc2.tar.gz</path>.  Extract the files 
contained into a directory.
</p>

<pre caption="Extract the drivers and run the install">
# <i>tar -xzf cups-samba-5.0rc2.tar.gz</i>
# <i>cd cups-samba-5.0rc2</i>
<comment>(Only use this script if CUPS resides in /usr/share/cups)</comment>
# <i>./cups-samba.install</i>
</pre>

<p>
<path>cups-samba.ss</path> is a TAR archive containing three files:
<path>cups5.hlp</path>, <path>cupsdrvr5.dll</path> and
<path>cupsui5.dll</path>. These are the actual driver files.
</p>

<warn>
The script <c>cups-samba.install</c> may not work for all *nixes (ie FreeBSD)
because almost everything which is not part of the base system is 
installed somewhere under the prefix <path>/usr/local/</path>. This 
seems not to be the case for most things you install under GNU/Linux. 
However, if your CUPS installation is somewhere other than 
<path>/usr/share/cups/</path> see the example below.
</warn> 

<p>
Suppose your CUPS installation resides under 
<path>/usr/local/share/cups/</path>, and you want to install the drivers there. 
Do the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Manually installing the drivers">
# <i>cd /path/you/extracted/the/CUPS-driver/tarball/into</i>
# <i>tar -xf cups-samba.ss</i>
<comment>(This extracts the files to usr/share/cups/drivers under the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY)</comment>
# <i>cd usr/share/cups/drivers</i>
<comment>(no leading / !)</comment>
# <i>cp cups* /usr/local/share/cups/drivers</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/cupsd restart</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we'll use the script <c>cupsaddsmb</c> provided by the CUPS distribution.
Its man page is an interesting read.
</p>

<pre caption="Run cupsaddsmb">
# <i>cupsaddsmb -H PrintServer -U root -h PrintServer -v HPDeskJet930C</i>
<comment>(Instead of HPDeskJet930C you could also specify "-a", which will
"export all known printers".)</comment>
# <i>cupsaddsmb -H PrintServer -U root -h PrintServer -a</i>
</pre>

<warn>
The execution of this command often causes the most trouble. 
Reading through the <uri 
link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=110931">posts in this 
thread</uri>.
</warn>

<p>
Here are common errors that may happen:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The hostname given as a parameter for <c>-h</c> and <c>-H</c>
    (<c>PrintServer</c>) often does not resolve correctly and doesn't
    identify the print server for CUPS/Samba interaction.  If an error
    like: <b>Warning: No PPD file for printer "CUPS_PRINTER_NAME" -
    skipping!</b> occurs, the first thing you should do is substitute
    <c>PrintServer</c> with <c>localhost</c> and try it again.
  </li>
  <li>
    The command fails with an <b>NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b>. This error message 
    is quite common, but can be triggered by many problems. It's unfortunately 
    not very helpful. One thing to try is to temporarily set <c>security = 
    user</c> in your <path>smb.conf</path>. After/if the installation completes 
    successfully, you should set it back to share, or whatever it was set to 
    before.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
This should install the correct driver directory structure under 
<path>/etc/samba/printer</path>. That would be 
<path>/etc/samba/printer/W32X86/2/</path>. The files contained should 
be the 3 driver files and the PPD file, renamed to YourPrinterName.ppd 
(the name which you gave the printer when installing it (see above).
</p>

<p>
Pending no errors or other complications, your drivers are now 
installed.

<title>Printer configuration of *nix based clients</title>

<p>
Despite the variation or distribution, the only thing needed is CUPS.  Do the
equivalent on any other UNIX/Linux/BSD client.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring a Gentoo system">
# <i>emerge cups</i>
# <i>nano -w /etc/cups/client.conf</i>
ServerName <i>PrintServer</i>      <comment># your printserver name</comment>
</pre>

<p>
That should be it. Nothing else will be needed.
</p>

<p>
If you use only one printer, it will be your default printer. If your print
server manages several printers, your administrator will have defined a default
printer on the server. If you want to define a different default printer for
yourself, use the <c>lpoptions</c> command.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting your default printer">

</pre>

<p>
Just point your web browser to <c>http://printserver:631</c> on the client if
you want to manage your printers and their jobs with a nice web interface.
Replace <c>printserver</c> with the name of the <e>machine</e> that acts as
your print server, not the name you gave to the cups print server if you used
different names.

<title>Mounting a Windows or Samba share in GNU/Linux</title>
<body>

<p>
Now is time to configure our kernel to support smbfs. Since I'm assumming we've
all compiled at least one kernel, we'll need to make sure we have all the right
options selected in our kernel.  For simplicity sake, make it a module for ease
of use.  It is the author's opinion that kernel modules are a good thing and
should be used whenever possible.
</p>

<pre caption="Relevant kernel options" >
CONFIG_SMB_FS=m
CONFIG_SMB_UNIX=y
</pre>

<p>
Then make the module/install it; insert them with:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading the kernel module">
# <i>modprobe smbfs</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once the modules is loaded, mounting a Windows or Samba share is 
possible.  Use <c>mount</c> to accomplish this, as detailed below:
</p>

<pre caption="Mounting a Windows/Samba share">
<comment>(The syntax for mounting a Windows/Samba share is:
  mount -t smbfs [-o username=xxx,password=xxx] //server/share /mnt/point
If we are not using passwords or a password is not needed)</comment>

# <i>mount -t smbfs //PrintServer/public /mnt/public</i>

<comment>(If a password is needed)</comment>
# <i>mount -t smbfs -o username=USERNAME,password=PASSWORD //PrintServer/public /mnt/public</i>
</pre>

<p>
After you mount the share, you would access it as if it were a local 
drive.

That's just a bit of point-and-click. Browse to
<path>\\PrintServer</path> and right click on the printer
(HPDeskJet930C) and click connect. This will download the drivers to
the Windows client and now every application (such as Word or Acrobat)
will offer HPDeskJet930C as an available printer to print to. :-)
