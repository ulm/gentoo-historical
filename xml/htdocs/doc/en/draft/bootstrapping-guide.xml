<abstract>
Bootstrapping means to build a toolchain so that it is ready to build the rest
of your system. Gentoo is a perfect operating system to perform such 
installation while retaining support from the software management system, 
Portage.

<title>What is Bootstrapping?</title>
<section>
<title>Definition</title>

<warn>
Not only is this guide still in its early stage, it is also built on theoretical
information found on the Internet and not from experience. It should be taken
with a big grain of salt until the steps in it are verified and accepted by more
experienced people.
</warn>

<p>
If we were to believe the stories, <e>bootstrapping</e> - the term - originates
from a German legend about Baron MÃ¼nchhausen who was able to save himself from
drowning in a swamp by pulling himself up by his hairs.
</p>

<p>
In computer theory, bootstrapping has several meanings. All of them boil down to
building more complex systems from simple ones. This document will discuss
bootstrapping a toolchain: building a full cross-compilation environment able to
build software for the target system.
</p>

<section>
<title>Toolchain Bootstrapping</title>
<body>

<p>
The process of bootstrapping a toolchain is two-fold.
</p>

<p>
At first, you use an existing toolchain to create a cross-compilation
environment, a toolchain capable of running on one system but building software
for a different one. The second step is to use the cross-compilation toolchain 
to rebuild itself so that it builds code native to the system it is booted on.
</p>

<p>
There are three important terms we use in this definition:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <e>host</e> system is the system on which the programs are ran, </li>
  <li>
    the <e>build</e> system is the system on which a particular package is being
    built, and
  </li>
  <li>
    the <e>target</e> system is the system for which the software generates
    output (like the compiler)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
After the toolchain is bootstrapped, the third stage is to build the rest of the
system using the native toolchain.
