<title>GCC Upgrading</title>
<body>

<p>
Why should you upgrade? Well, GCC is quite similar to any other package on your
system, just a bit more critical. You should upgrade GCC whenever a new version
fixes some bug that annoys you, new functionality you need is introduced, or if
you want to keep your system up-to-date. If none of the previous cases apply to
you, you can safely postpone upgrade as long as your GCC version is supported by
Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
If you install a newer version of GCC, the system will not switch over to use it
automatically. You'll have to explicitly request the change because the
migration process might require some additional steps. If you decide not to
switch, Portage will continue to use older version of your compiler until you
change your mind, or remove the old compiler from the system.
</p>

<p>
This guide will document the necessary steps required to perform a seamless
upgrade of the compiler used by your Gentoo box. A specific section is dedicated
to the <uri link="#upgrade-3.3-to-3.4">upgrade from GCC 3.3 to the 3.4
version</uri> and issues with <c>libstdc++</c>.

<impo>
If you're looking for instructions specific to upgrades from GCC-3.3 to
GCC-3.4, please consult the <uri link="#upgrade-3.3-to-3.4">dedicated
section</uri>.
</impo>

<p>
Generally speaking, upgrades to <e>bug fix releases</e>, like from 3.3.5 to
3.3.6, should be quite safe -- just emerge new version, switch your system to
use it and rebuild the only affected package, <c>libtool</c>. However, some GCC
upgrades break binary compatibility; in such cases a rebuild of the affected
packages (or even whole toolchain and system) might be required.
</p>

<p>
When we spoke about the need to switch your compiler to the newer version by
hand, we said it won't happen automatically. However, there is one exception --
upgrades to bug fix releases, like from 3.3.5 to 3.3.6 in case you don't use the
"multislot" feature allowing them to coexist on one system. Multislot is
disabled by default as the majority of users won't benefit from it.

It is safe to remove older GCC version at this time. If you feel the
need, please issue the following command (as usual, substitute
<c>=sys-devel/gcc-3.3*</c> with the version you want to uninstall):

<title>Upgrading from GCC-3.3 to 3.4</title>
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The upgrade from GCC/3.3 to 3.4 is not so seamless as the C++ ABI changed
between these two versions so there is an issue with <c>libstdc++</c> library
which must be taken care of as well.
</p>

</body>

<section id="upgrade-3.3-to-3.4-choices">
<title>The Choices</title>
<body>

<impo>
If you're upgrading on a SPARC machine, you will have to take the way of
<uri link="#upgrade-3.3-to-3.4-emerge-e">complete system rebuild</uri> due to
some internal <uri link="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/sparc-abi.html">ABI
changes</uri> in GCC's parameter passing.
</impo>

<p>
You have two possibilities on how to upgrade your system. <uri
link="#upgrade-3.3-to-3.4-revdep-rebuild">First method</uri> is faster and
requires use of <c>revdep-rebuild</c> tool from package <c>gentoolkit</c> while
the <uri link="#upgrade-3.3-to-3.4-emerge-e">second one</uri> rebuilds the
entire system from scratch so it will make use of new GCC features. It's up to
you to decide which of these two ways you will choose.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="upgrade-3.3-to-3.4-revdep-rebuild">
<title>Using revdep-rebuild</title>
<body>

<p>
This method requires that you first install <c>gentoolkit</c> if you have not
already done so. Then we will upgrade GCC and switch to the new compiler. We
will also rebuild the <c>libtool</c> package to ensure that toolchain is in
healthy state.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing gentoolkit and upgrading GCC">
# <i>emerge -an gentoolkit</i>
# <i>emerge -uav gcc</i>
# <i>gcc-config i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.4</i>
# <i>source /etc/profile</i>

<comment>(Rebuilding libtool)</comment>
# <i>emerge --oneshot -av libtool</i>
</pre>

<note>
This assumes that you have <c>CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu"</c> set. If you are
using another CHOST, please use the appropriate gcc-config line.
</note>

<p>
Now, we want to see which packages that revdep-rebuild will want to rebuild.
Then we will tell revdep-rebuild to actually rebuild the packages. This may take
some time, so have some patience.
</p>

<pre caption="Using revdep-rebuild">
# <i>revdep-rebuild --library libstdc++.so.5 -- -p -v</i>
# <i>revdep-rebuild --library libstdc++.so.5</i>
</pre>

<note>
It is possible that you might have problems with non-existing package versions
due to them being outdated or masked. If this is the case, you will want to use
the <c>--package-names</c> option to <c>revdep-rebuild</c>. This causes packages
to be recompiled based on the package name, rather than the exact name and
version.
</note>

<p>
To provide compatibility with older binary C++ applications and any packages
that revdep-rebuild might have missed, <c>sys-libs/libstdc++-v3</c> needs to be
merged before you unmerge GCC 3.3 from your system.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing libstdc++-v3 and cleaning up">
# <i>emerge --oneshot sys-libs/libstdc++-v3</i>
# <i>emerge -aC =sys-devel/gcc-3.3*</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section id="upgrade-3.3-to-3.4-emerge-e">
<title>Using emerge -e</title>
<body>

<p>
This method, while much slower, will rebuild your whole system to ensure that
everything has been rebuilt with your new compiler, and therefore safer. At
first, you will upgrade GCC and libtool and switch to your new compiler.
</p>

<pre caption="Upgrading GCC">
# <i>emerge -uav gcc</i>

</pre>

<note>
This assumes that you have <c>CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu"</c> set. If you are
using another CHOST, please use the appropriate gcc-config line.

<p>

<c>sys-libs/libstdc++-v3</c> needs to be merged onto your system.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing libstdc++-v3">
# <i>emerge --oneshot sys-libs/libstdc++-v3</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we will go about first rebuilding the system target, then the world target.
This will take a very long time, depending on the number of packages that you
have installed, as it will rebuild your entire toolchain and supporting system
files, followed by every package on your system, including the toolchain. This
is necessary to ensure that all packages have been compiled with the new
toolchain, including the toolchain itself.
</p>

<pre caption="Rebuilding system and world">
# <i>emerge -e system</i>
# <i>emerge -e world</i>

It is also safe to remove older GCC versions at this time:

<p>
It's important to disable <c>distcc</c> during upgrade. Mixing compiler versions
on your nodes <e>will</e> cause build issues. This is not required for ccache,
as the cache objects will be invalidated anyway.
</p>

<p>
Always use same GCC version for your kernel and additional kernel modules. Once
you rebuild your world with new GCC, external modules (like
<c>app-emulation/qemu-softmmu</c>) will fail to load. Please rebuild your kernel
with new GCC to fix that.
</p>

<section>
<title>Frequent Error Messages</title>
<body>

<p>
If your system complains about something like <e>libtool: link:
`/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.3.6/libstdc++.la' is not a valid libtool
archive</e>, please run <c>/sbin/fix_libtool_files.sh 3.3.6</c> (substitute
"3.3.6" with the version numbers from the error message).
</p>

<p>
If you see the <e>error: /usr/bin/gcc-config: line 632:
/etc/env.d/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.3.5: No such file or directory</e>, then try
deleting <path>/etc/env.d/gcc/config-i686-pc-linux-gnu</path> and running
<c>gcc-config</c> again, followed by <c>source /etc/profile</c>. Only do this if
you do not have any cross-compilers set up, though.
</p>

<p>
If a package fails during <c>emerge -e system/world</c>, you can resume
operation with <c>emerge --resume</c>. If a package fails repeatedly, skip it
with <c>emerge --resume --skipfirst</c>. Don't run any other instances of emerge
in between or you will lose the resume information.
</p>

<p>
If you get an error message <e>spec failure: unrecognized spec option</e> while
upgrading your compiler, try to switch back to your default compiler, unset the
<c>GCC_SPECS</c> variable and upgrade GCC again:
</p>

<pre caption="Restoring primary specs">
# <i>gcc-config 1</i>
# <i>source /etc/profile</i>
# <i>unset GCC_SPECS</i>
# <i>emerge -uav gcc</i>
</pre>
