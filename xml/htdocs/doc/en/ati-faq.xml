<title>Is my ATI board supported?</title>
<body>
<p>Almost every ATI board is supported by <uri link="http://www.xfree86.org">Xfree86</uri>,
at least for the 2D accelerated features.  The 3D support is provided either by
<uri link="http://dri.sf.net">the DRI project</uri>, which is already present inside XFree86, 
or by closed source drivers
<uri link="http://mirror.ati.com/support/drivers/linux/radeon-linux.html">provided</uri> by ATI.

<title>I have an All-In-Wonder/Vivo board.  Are the multimedia features supported?</title>
<body>
<p>The multimedia features are actually supported by
<uri link="http://gatos.sf.net">the GATOS project</uri>.</p>
<warn>ati-gatos is currently outdated.  We are planning to add gatos support directly
inside xfree.</warn>

<section>
<title>I'm not using an x86.  What are my options?</title>
<body>
<p>You have almost the same xfree support on ppc or alpha platform but you can't use
the ATI closed source drivers.  That means that you can't use the r300 3d features at all.
If you have such a board and you want it supported by xfree, you should contact
<uri link="http://www.ati.com">ATI</uri> and ask them to open the specs.</p>

<section>
<title>I have a laptop.  Is my "mobility" ATI model supported?</title>
<body>
<p>It should be but you may have a configuration issue due to the OEM PCI id that such
chips may have.  In most cases you may have to write the configuration file yourself or
use the <c>xf86config</c>.

<title>Installation</title>

<section>
<title>Packages</title>
<body>
<p>
The <c>xfree</c> ebuild provides XFree86. <c>xfree-drm</c> provides the kernel
modules required by DRI and <c>ati-drivers</c> provides the ATI closed source X
drivers and kernel modules.
</p>
<impo>
Your kernel must have agpgart support and not have the DRM modules compiled in.
</impo>
<pre>
<codenote>If you want just the Rage128 drivers and modules
installed with xfree
</codenote>
# VIDEO_CARDS="rage128" emerge xfree-drm
<codenote>To have just the Radeon support</codenote>
<codenote>(r100, r200, r250, but not r300 yet)</codenote>
# VIDEO_CARDS="radeon" emerge xfree-drm
<codenote>To install the ATI closed source drivers</codenote>
<codenote>(r200,r250 and r300 only)</codenote>
# emerge ati-drivers
<codenote>To install just XFree86 but not install</codenote>
<codenote>any kernel module</codenote>
# emerge xfree
</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Configuration</title>
<body>
<p>It is suggested the use of <c>xf86cfg</c>, <c>xf86config</c> or directly by
using the XFree86 auto configuration option:
<pre>
# X -configure
</pre>
For more information on how to get a basic <c>XF86Config</c> configuration file,
please refer to the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/desktop.xml">Desktop Configuration Guide</uri>.</p>
<note> Users of the ati-drivers can also use <c>fglrxconfig</c>.</note>
<impo>PPC users should use the <c>Xeasyconf</c> stand alone configurator by
emerging the <c>xeasyconf</c> ebuild.</impo>
