<title>How do I verify with Mac OS X the downloaded ISO is not corrupted?</title>
<body>

<p>
First be sure you did not mount the ftp server with <e>Finder</e> and then copy
the file with drag'n'drop. This will corrupt the ISO. Instead, use <c>curl</c>
(with <c>curl -O http://path/to/iso</c>).
</p>

<p>
You can check your MD5 sum using the <c>md5sum</c> tool provided with OSX. On
versions of OSX without md5sum, you can use <c>openssl</c> capability to
produce an md5 checksum.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating an md5sum with openssl">
<comment>(This could take some time depending of the size of the ISO and your CPU)</comment>
$ <i>openssl md5 /path/to/iso</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now compare this output with the appropriate file found on the server where you
downloaded the ISO (the file will end with <path>.md5</path>). If it is the
same, the ISO image downloaded correctly. Be sure you have <e>not</e> mounted
it (e.g. with Disk Copy) yet!

<title>Can I dual-boot Gentoo Linux and Mac OS X?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes you can! In fact, <e>yabootconfig</e> will automatically detect and setup
<path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> with Linux, Mac OS X and even classic Mac OS (see
the <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml?part=1&amp;chap=10">Gentoo
Handbook </uri> for details on yabootconfig). The trick is in how you partition
your hard drive. Before installing Gentoo, startup with the Mac OS X Install
CD. Use the <c>Disk Utility</c> to partition the drive in your machine into two
or three partitions. Alternatively, use <c>parted</c> from a recent Gentoo
InstallCD, since that has been patched to handle HFS and HFS+ partitions.
Parted is also able to shrink a partition so you don't need to delete your
existing install. The first partition should be big enough to contain all your
Linux partitions (root+swap+/home etc.). The format of this partition does not
matter. The second partition should be for OS X. The third (and optional)
partition should be for classic Mac OS. It is only required if you intend of
being able to triple boot, since OS9 must be on a seperate partition from OSX
for this to work.
</p>

<p>
After partitioning, install Mac OS X and Mac OS 9 onto their respective
partitions. Once installation is complete, start following the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>. When you get to
the section on partitioning, use <c>mac-fdisk</c> to <e>delete</e> the large
partition you created for Gentoo. In its place, create a bootstrap partition,
root, swap, and any other partitions you wish to use with Gentoo.
</p>

<p>
If you have an OldWorld Macintosh (pre-iMac), follow a similar procedure as
described above. However, use the Mac OS 9 install CD and the <c>Drive
Setup</c> utility. OldWorld machines do not need a bootstrap partition.
</p>

<note>
If yabootconfig does not detect your MacOS partitions, you can manually add
them to your yaboot.config. See the example yaboot.conf in the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml?part=1&amp;chap=10#doc_chap_pre6">
handbook</uri> for details.

I have an early NewWorld Mac such as the Blue and White G3. It should be
compatible with the LiveCD, but on boot it returns an "Unknown or corrupt
filesystem" error.
</title>
<body>

<p>
As a workaround, boot into Open Firmware by holding down the Apple + Option + O
+ F keys on startup. When the prompt appears, type:
</p>

<pre caption="Early NewWorld Mac Open Firmware work around">

The CD should boot as expected now, thanks to John Plesmid for this workaround.

I have a Beige G3 machine. Can I install Gentoo Linux/PPC on a second IDE hard
drive?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Early Beige G3 machines (those with a "Rev 1" motherboard with an ATI RageII+
chip) do not support slave IDE drives. To use a second hard drive with this
machine, you would have to attach it to the internal or external SCSI
connector, use install a PCI IDE card. Later G3 machines do not have this
limitation. See <uri>http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/G3-ZONE/IDE/index.html</uri>
for more information.

<title>
When I try and install Gentoo on my PowerBook or iBook the internal hard drive
does not show up. What should I do?
</title>
<body>

<p>
For a PowerBook, pass <c>hda=1,1,1</c> to the kernel at boot time. That should
solve your problems. You can do this at <e>yaboot</e> prompt by typing <c>boot
hda=1,1,1</c>. Some iBooks need <c>hda=16383,16,64</c>.
</p>

<title>
I have a revision A or B iMac. I've replaced the hard drive with a larger one
and now I can't boot into anything!
</title>
<body>

<p>
There is an 8GB limit for the root partition on these machines. Ensure that
your root partition is less than 8GB and it should work as expected. This also
applies to OS X and later versions of OS 9.

<title>
My /etc/fstab file has /dev/BOOT in it. Do I need to setup this line for my
bootstrap partition?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. If you are not running a separate boot partition (<path>/boot</path>) then
you do not need this line and can safely just delete it from
<path>/etc/fstab</path>. The bootstrap partition is <e>not</e>
<path>/boot</path> and is not related in anyway. In general, PowerPC machines
do not need a separate <path>/boot</path> partition, and the bootstrap
partition should not be mounted.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>
When I rebooted, yaboot didn't work! Now, I'm stuck. How can I fix this?
</title>
<body>

<p>
It's probably just a misconfigured yaboot.conf. The easiest way to fix this is
to boot the LiveCD again, mount your gentoo partition and check yaboot.conf for
errors. You'll also need to run <c>ybin -v -C /mnt/gentoo/etc/yaboot.conf</c>
to update the boot loader once you have finished. This can all be done without
chrooting back into your install.
</p>

<note>
If you <e>really</e> just need to get back to OSX, try holding down the Option
key on startup. This should give you a graphical selection of bootable disks.
Choose OSX and remember to fix your boot problems later.

Installation is now complete. However after rebooting, I am getting different
characters than the keys I press on my machine's keyboard. What should I do?
</title>
<body>

<p>
If this is an English keymap, you likely have a kernel config issue. You will
need to rebuild your kernel with the following options:
</p>

<pre caption="Input core support">
<comment>(these are the defaults, but check them)</comment>
&lt;*&gt; Input core support
&lt;*&gt;   Keyboard support
&lt;*&gt;   Mouse support
(1024)   Horizontal screen resolution
(768)    Vertical screen resolution
&lt; &gt;   Joystick support
&lt;*&gt;   Event interface support
</pre>

<pre caption="Macintosh Device Drivers">
[*] Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support
[*]    Use input layer for ADB devices
[*]      Support for mouse button 2+3 emulation
</pre>

<p>
This way, you will still be able to use <path>/proc/sys/dev/mac_hid</path> to
emulate buttons 2 and 3 (see next question).
</p>

<p>
If, for some reason you do not want to recompile your kernel, append
<c>keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes=1</c> to the kernel arguments in
<path>yaboot.conf</path>. This will also correct the problem, but might
possibly introduce other problems.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Joe McMahon for help with this answer.

I only have one mouse-button. How can I make use of the second and third one,
since ctrl-button does not work?
</title>
<body>

<p>
There is no way to use ctrl-button like on Mac OS X, but you can map just about
any key or combination of keys to emulate the second and third mouse-button.
The values can be obtained with the command line utility <c>showkey</c> from
the console. Note that this program does not work as expected from X and should
only be run from the console. In addition to having the kernel configuration
settings from the previous section, you will also need to set the mouse button
values in <path>/etc/sysctl.conf</path>. Here is an example using F11 and F12:
</p>

<pre caption="Mouse button emulation with F11 and F12">
<comment># Enable mouse button emulation</comment>
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button_emulation = 1
<comment># Set 2nd button to 87 - F11</comment>
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button2_keycode = 87
<comment># Set 3rd button to 88 - F12</comment>
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button3_keycode = 88
</pre>

<p>
Other commonly used keycodes are 125 (The Apple key) and 96 (The Keypad Enter).
</p>

<note>
The easiest way to activate these settings it to reboot after changing them.

Installation is now complete. However, after my machine boots into Gentoo and I
try to emerge anything, I see errors saying it cannot 'stat' a file. What is
wrong?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Check to see that your time is set correctly. Setting your time and linking
<path>/etc/localtime</path> to your proper timezone (in
<path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>) will solve your problems. Also make sure that
you have <e>not</e> enabled the <e>Enhanced RTC</e> option in the <e>Character
devices</e> section of the kernel configuration (as stated in install guide).

How do I enable the full processor speed on my PowerBook while running Linux?
</title>
<body>

<note>
Most (if not all) processors should now work at the correct speed with modern
kernels. If you still have this problem, you should upgrade to the latest
kernel and try again, only use this as a backup solution.
</note>

<p>
Some processors in PowerBooks start up at slower speed than they are designed
to run. Running at this slower speed conserves battery life with the tradeoff
of performance. The operating system on the machine must instruct the hardware
to run at its full speed. In Mac OS X this is called "Reduced processor
performance" or "CPU Scaling" in Linux. To check the current speed of your
processor while running in Linux, type <c>cat /proc/cpuinfo</c>. In Mac OS X,
you first have to turn off "Reduce processor performance" in the "Options" tab
of the <e>Energy Saver</e> system preference panel. Then run <e>Apple System
Profiler</e> (in Applications:Utilities).
</p>

<warn>
Do not use this method to overclock your machine. Results are unpredictable if
you use an improper value. We are not responsible if you fry your machine!
</warn>

<p>
If <e>Apple System Profiler</e> reports a higher speed than what you get when
running in Linux, you can enable the full speed of the processor with a simple
command. First, your machine needs to be running kernel <c>2.4.20-pre9-ben0</c>
or later. Earlier kernels do not have the code necessary to change the
processor speed. Second, you will need to compile the kernel with <c>CPU
Frequency scaling</c> <e>disabled</e>. Finally, run an appropriate command as
shown in the examples below.
</p>

<pre caption="CPU Frequency scaling">
<comment>(These are examples only. Use values appropriate for your machine.)</comment>

<comment>(For a 1GHz PowerBook G4)</comment>
echo "0:667000:1000000:performance" > /proc/cpufreq

<comment>(For an 800MHz PowerBook G4)</comment>
echo "0:667000:800000:performance" > /proc/cpufreq

<comment>(For 2.6.x kernels, use this path instead of /proc/cpufreq)</comment>
echo "0:667000:1000000:performance" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed
</pre>

<p>
Many users will want to add this command to the end of
<path>/etc/conf.d/local.start</path>. This file is sourced every time your
machine starts.

I'm running Gentoo on a PowerPC laptop. What packages should I install to
enable laptop-specific functionality?
</title>
<body>

<p>
There are four main packages you will need to install.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <e>pbbuttonsd</e> is a tool that enables the brightness and volume keys on
    most ppc laptops. The current versions also work as a powermanager.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>gtkpbbuttons</e> gives you a gtk front end for pbbuttonsd (visual
    feedback on button presses in X). <e>gtkpbbuttons</e> requires gtk and
    should be added to your X session file (<path>~/.Xsession</path>) for best
    results (so that it is always running while in X).
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>powerprefs</e> ties together with pbbuttonsd, and gives you the ability
    to edit settings such as power-management, trackpad options and various
    other preferences.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>cpudyn</e> allows cpu speed scaling for longer battery life. Other
    packages also provide the same functionality, such as <e>powernowd</e>,
    <e>cpufreqd</e> and <e>speedfreq</e>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These packages can be installed by running the appropriate commands from the
list below:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing laptop-specific packages">
# <i>emerge pbbuttonsd; rc-update add pbbuttonsd default</i>
# <i>emerge gtkpbbuttons</i>
# <i>emerge powerprefs</i>
# <i>emerge cpudyn</i>
</pre>

<note>
You should edit <path>/etc/pbbuttonsd.conf</path> to better suit your needs.
The behaviour of the Fx-keys can be controlled here as well as many sleep
options. To switch the Fx-keys to the OSX behaviour, set KBDMode to fkeyslast.
You can turn off touchpad tapping by setting TPMode to notap. Many other
options are available, see man pbbuttonsd.conf for details.
</note>

<p>
It is useful to add pbbuttonsd and cpudyn to your boot runlevel so that they're
started when your computer starts. To do this:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding pbbuttonsd and cpudyn to the boot runlevel">
# <i>rc-update add pbbuttonsd boot</i>
# <i>rc-update add cpudyn boot</i>

<title>How can I configure my machine's Airport or other Wi-Fi card?</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure you have support for the airport card compiled into the kernel, or
compiled as a module and loaded. Changing the wireless settings is accomplished
using iwconfig. This is part of the <c>wireless-tools</c> package.
</p>

<p>
As an example of using iwconfig, to set your SSID to home_ssid:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting an SSID">
# <i>iwconfig wlan0 essid home_ssid</i>
</pre>

<p>
Where wlan0 is your wifi card's device name. For Airport users, the wifi device
is often eth1. For more details on iwconfig, refer to its man page.
</p>

<note>
Airport Extreme cards are not yet supported on Linux, but a workaround now
exists, please see this forum post for more information:

<title>Does sleep work on my iBook/PowerBook?</title>
<body>

<p>
Sleep (suspend to ram) works very well on all G3 iBooks and TiBooks. Recently,
a kernel patch has been released that adds sleep support for G4 iBooks and
Radeon based AlBooks. If you have one of these laptops, use
vanilla-sources-2.6.12 or gentoo-sources 2.6.11 for built in support.
</p>

<note>
Note that the 12" PowerBook is not yet supported due to its nVidia chipset.

I can't emerge a package, and get an error about it being masked. What should I
do?
</title>
<body>

<p>
There are two common reasons why a package will not emerge: either it hasn't
been tested on PPC or it has been tested, but hasn't yet been marked stable.
</p>

<p>
If your package hasn't yet been tested on PPC, you'll need to first mark the
ebuild with the ppc keyword. This is done using the ekeyword tool which is part
of the gentoolkit-dev package. To mark the ebuild ppc:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding the ppc keyword to app-foo/bar">
$ <i>ekeyword ppc /usr/portage/app-foo/bar/bar-1.0.ebuild</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once the ebuild has been keyworded, you can now emerge it as usual. Test the
application and if it works, <b>please</b> report it as a bug so one of the
developers can add the keyword.
</p>

<note>
This change will only last until the next sync. If you need a more permanent
fix, you can maintain a portage overlay. See the portage documentation for more
information.
</note>

<p>
If your package already has the ~ppc keyword, you have two options. Either
follow the above instructions and replace the ~ppc keyword with ppc, or you can
use /etc/portage to unmask the specific package.
</p>

<pre caption="Using /etc/portage to unmask app-foo/bar">
$ <i>echo "=app-foo/bar-1.0 ~ppc" > /etc/portage/package.keywords</i>
</pre>

<note>
If the /etc/portage directory does not exist, make sure to create it first.
</note>

<p>
Now emerge the package as normal. Once you're sure the app is stable, <b>please
</b> report this as a bug so the developers can add the keyword.

<title>Does Gentoo/PPC have support for Flash?</title>
<body>

<p>
Well, not really. Macromedia has not supplied a linux/ppc binary and open
source implementations are incomplete and buggy at this time. Two projects that
are working on this problem are <uri
link="http://gplflash.sf.net">gplflash2</uri> and <uri
link="http://swfdec.sf.net">swfdec</uri>, so check with these projects for more
information. A possible workaround for now is to use qemu (an x86 emulator) to
run the Macromedia Flash Player 6 stand alone player. This process was
described on the forums:

<title>Is there an easy way to configure X?</title>
<body>

<p>
Simply emerge <c>Xorgautoconfig</c>. Once the package has been emerged, run
<c>Xorgautoconfig</c> to generate the config for your setup. If you would like
to set a keyboard layout, you can use the --keymap flag. Note that although
<c>Xorgautoconfig</c> does set up DRM for most users, you may need to change
your kernel configuration to support this.
</p>

<title>
How can I enable Direct Rendering (DRM) on rage128 or radeon cards?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure in your kernel config you have the following options set:
</p>

<pre caption="DRM kernel configuration">
Device Drivers - Character devices ---&gt;
  &lt;*&gt; /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)
  [*] Apple UniNorth support
  [*] Direct Rendering Manager (DRI support)
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Rage 128
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Radeon
Device Drivers - Graphics Support ---&gt;
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Rage 128 display support
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Radeon display support
</pre>

<p>
Rebuild and install the kernel if necessary. After this, make sure you
have booted to the native framebuffer (i.e. radeonfb or atyfb and
<e>not</e> from offb or ofonly video), and run <c>Xorgautoconfig</c>.
</p>

<impo>
You may need to edit your <path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path> file depending on
your card setup. Ensure that the device driver selected is either ati or your
specific driver (r128 or radeon). Also check that the DRI extension is loaded
and not commented out.
</impo>

<note>
There currently isn't any DRI support for the R300/R400 chipsets, but a project
has been started at <uri>http://r300.sourceforge.net</uri>. Initial support for
the chipset is slated to be included in the next major version of X.org as the
r300 project is now part of the DRI project. nVidia chipsets are also mostly
unsupported on PPC, there is basic 2D acceleration provied by the nv driver,
but no 3D acceleration.

I recently emerged Xorg, but when using it, my international keyboard layout

special characters like the "at" sign. The startx output says something like
"could not load keymap, falling back to default keymap". What is wrong?
</title>

<p>
Check that the permissions on <path>/var/tmp</path> are set to
<path>drwxrwxrwx</path>. If not, change them by typing <c>chmod a+rwx
/var/tmp</c>. This will allow Xorg to load keymaps properly again.

<title>How do I get sound playback working?</title>
<body>

<p>
There are two approaches to sound on modern kernels: OSS or ALSA. OSS is the
older of the two options and has been depreciated, but still functions well for
many older Macs. ALSA is the newer method and will continue to be supported in
the future. We recommend that you use ALSA unless you have problems.
</p>

<note>
If you include the OSS driver in your kernel, the ALSA driver will not load.
</note>

<p>
In addition to configuring the kernel, users who should have access to the
audio devices need to be added to the appropriate group with the command:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding users to the audio group">
# <i>gpasswd -a username audio</i>
</pre>

<p>
If the kernel is set up correctly, but you can't hear any sound, ensure that
the main mixer volume is turned up and that the device isn't muted!
</p>

<note>
If you are using a G5 or a mac-mini, you should follow the Gentoo ALSA
configuration guide to install the latest version of the ALSA drivers instead
of the versions supplied by the kernel.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Sound setup with ALSA</title>
<body>

<p>
For ALSA, we'll set up both the regular ALSA drivers and the OSS emulation
layer so that we can still use legacy OSS only programs. In <c>make
menuconfig</c> you'll need to select:
</p>

<title>How do I play Audio CDs?</title>
<body>

<p>
NewWorld machines have no audio connection between their CD-ROM drive and their
sound hardware. Therefore, audio information must be read as data and then
piped to the sound hardware. This is possible using <e>xmms</e> and the
<e>xmms-cdread</e> plugin, that reads the audio off the CD over the ATA cable,
decodes it in software and sends it to the sound card over the PCI bus as
digital data. If you want 'true' cd-playing, you have to do the following
steps:
</p>

<p>
First, you will need to rebuild your kernel with the following options:
</p>

<pre caption="Kernel options for playing audio-CDs">
<comment>(In "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL Support")</comment>
<comment>(In "IDE, ATA, and ATAPI Block Devices")</comment>
&lt; &gt; Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support  <comment>(turn this OFF)</comment>
&lt;M&gt; SCSI emulation support           <comment>(compile this as a module)</comment>

<comment>(In "SCSI Support")</comment>
&lt;M&gt; SCSI support                     <comment>(compile this as a module)</comment>
&lt;M&gt; SCSI CD-ROM support              <comment>(compile this as a module)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Then, append <c>hdX=ide-scsi</c> to the kernel image section(s) in
<path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> where <c>hdX</c> is the IDE device corresponding
to your CD player. This is usually <c>hdc</c>. Type <c>ybin -v</c> to install
the new yaboot.conf settings. Edit <path>/etc/group</path> add any users who
should be able to play CDs to the <c>cdrom</c> group. You will now need to
reboot your system for the kernel changes to take effect.
</p>

<p>
Upon reboot, <c>su</c> to root and change the permissions of the cd device,
then install xmms:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing permission for cdrom and install xmms-read">
# <i>chown root:cdrom /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd</i>
# <i>chmod 660 /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd</i>
# <i>emerge xmms xmms-cdread</i>
</pre>

<note>
Make sure to use the path corresponding to the CD drive on your machine.
</note>

<p>
To play a CD, fire up <c>xmms</c> and enter <c>/dev/cdrom</c> as the file you
want to play.

<title>Can I run Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X under Gentoo Linux?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, as long as you are running Gentoo Linux on PPC hardware, you can use <uri
link="http://www.maconlinux.org/">Mac-on-Linux</uri> which allows you to run an
instance of OS 9, OS X or Linux as a process on Linux. Simply <c>emerge mol</c>
to install this package. MOL supports Mac OS 7.5.2 to 9.2.2, as well as any
version OS X except Tiger (support is currently in progress). It can be run
from a console framebuffer or run in a window on X.
</p>

<note>
To run MOL fullscreen, you'll need to compile MOL with the fbcon use flag
enabled and run it in a console framebuffer.
</note>

<p>
For networking and sound you should install the drivers in the folder
<path>MOL-Install</path> on your Mac OS X-Desktop. If errors with networking
occur, make sure you have the following kernel options enabled:
</p>

<p>
For the dhcp server:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Socket Filtering (CONFIG_FILTER)</li>
  <li>Packet Socket (CONFIG_PACKET)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For NAT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network packet filtering (CONFIG_NETFILTER)</li>
  <li>Connection tracking (CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK)</li>
  <li>IP tables support (CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES)</li>
  <li>Packet filtering (CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER)</li>
  <li>Full NAT (CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT)</li>
  <li>MASQUERADE target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE)</li>
</ul>

<title>Can I access my ext2/ext3 partitions from OSX?</title>
<body>

<p>
OSX can support the reading and writing of ext2/ext3 partitions by using the
kernel extension provided by the <uri
link="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsx">ext2fsx project.</uri>
</p>

<note>
When using MOL, you cannot access a partition that is currently being used by
Linux.

<title>Which Portage USE flags do not work on PowerPC machines?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you're using an old flat profile, (depreciated, pre 2005.0) look at
<path>/etc/make.profile/use.mask</path> for a list.
</p>

<p>
If you're using a cascaded profile, (2005.0 and onwards) look at
<path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/ppc/use.mask</path> for a list.

<title>How can I set up distcc with my x86 box?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you've got another faster computer, you can set up distcc to compile
binaries for your slower ppc processor. It's better to do as much building as
possible on the faster machine, if possible, don't even build on the slower
computer. With that said, here are a few links to get you started:
<uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/CROSS-COMPILE-HOWTO</uri>

<title>Why does gcc keep segfaulting during ebuilds?</title>
<body>

<p>
If gcc segfaults during ebuilds, this probably isn't a bug with gcc and isn't
even a problem with your hardware. Most of the time this problem is due to
kernel preemption being enabled. Although this option is safe on x86, it can
cause cache corruption on PPC which is why it is noticed most frequently during
compiles. To prevent this from happening, simply recompile the kernel with
preempt turned off. To check if preempt is enabled:
</p>

<pre caption="Check if preempt is enabled">
$ <i>grep PREEMPT /usr/src/linux/.config</i>
</pre>

<p>
If returns: "# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set", then you should report the segfault
as a bug.
</p>

<p>
If it returns: "CONFIG_PREEMPT=y", then you'll need to disable it and rebuild
your kernel.
