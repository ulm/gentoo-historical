	<title>Installation</title>

	<section>
		<title>Can I dual-boot Gentoo Linux and Mac OS X?</title>
		<body><p>Yes you can! In fact, yabootconfig will automatically detect and setup <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> with Linux, Mac OS X and even classic Mac OS (see the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-install.xml">Gentoo PPC Install Guide</uri> for details on yabootconfig). The trick is in how you partition your hard drive. Before installing Gentoo, startup with the Mac OS X install CD. Use the <c>Disk Utility</c> to partition the drive in your machine into two or three partitions. The first should be a single partition the total size of all your Linux partitions (root+swap+/home etc.). The format of this partition does not matter. The second should be for OS X. The third (and optional) partition should be for classic Mac OS. It is needed only if you want to put Mac OS 9 on a separate partition. Note that if you want to be able to triple-boot with yaboot, Mac OS 9 needs to be on a separate partition from your Mac OS X installation.</p>
			<p>After partitioning, install Mac OS X and Mac OS 9 onto their respective partitions. Once installation is complete, start following the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-install.xml">Gentoo Linux PPC Install Guide</uri>. When you get to the section on partitioning, use <c>mac-fdisk</c> to <e>delete</e> the large partition you created for Gentoo. In its place, create a bootstrap partition, root, swap, and any other partitions you want to use with Gentoo.</p>
			<p>If you have an OldWorld Macintosh (pre-iMac), follow a similar procedure as described above. However, use the Mac OS 9 install CD and the <c>Drive Setup</c> utility. OldWorld machines do not need a bootstrap partition.</p>
		</body>

	<section>
		<title>I have an OldWorld Macintosh and need to use BootX. However, I am having trouble opening the BootX installer on the PPC install CD. What can I do?</title>
		<body><p>You will need a new version of StuffIt Expander to open the file. You can <uri link="http://www.stuffit.com/expander/download.html">download it</uri> for free.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Is it possible to boot Gentoo Linux on an OldWorld machine without MacOS? I would like to have a MacOS-free machine.</title>
		<body><p>If you have a lot of time to experiment, you could try <uri link="http://penguinppc.org/projects/quik/">Quik</uri>. Quik is a bootloader for OldWorld PPC machines. If your machine uses BootX, you can use Quik; if it uses yaboot, you can't. Quik can be incredibly difficult to install, and is currently <em>not</em> working with gcc 3.x (read: Gentoo 1.4 or better), but the end result is somewhere between "neato" and "breathtaking" because MacOS does not have to load. Think yaboot on speed.</p>
			<p>Be sure to read the <uri link="http://penguinppc.org/projects/quik/quirks.shtml">Quik quirks page</uri>. Also see "<uri link="http://lppcfom.sourceforge.net/fom-serve/cache/574.html">Is Quik Bootloader for Mac OS Dead?</uri>" and "<uri link="http://www.imaclinux.net/php/imaclinux_g_h.php3?single=17+index=0">Guide: Quik - Direct Booting for Older PowerMacs</uri>". "<uri link="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html">NetBSD/macppc Model Support</uri>" documents OpenFirmware versions for various Apple and clone PowerPC machines.</p>

	<section>
		<title>I have a Beige G3 machine. Can I install Gentoo Linux/PPC on a second IDE hard drive?</title>
		<body><p>Early Beige G3 machines (those with a "Rev 1" motherboard with an ATI RageII+ chip) do not support slave IDE drives. To use a second hard drive with this machine, you would have to attach it to the internal or external SCSI connector, use install a PCI IDE card. Later G3 machines do not have this limitation. See <uri>http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/G3-ZONE/IDE/index.html</uri> for more information.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>When I try and install Gentoo on my PowerBook or iBook the internal hard drive does not show up. What should I do?</title>
		<body><p>For a PowerBook, pass <e>hda=1,1,1</e> to the kernel at boot time. That should solve your problems. You can do this at yaboot prompt by typing <c>boot hda=1,1,1</c>. Some iBooks need <c>hda=16383,16,64</c>.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>My <path>/etc/fstab</path> file has <path>/dev/BOOT</path> in it. Do I need to setup this line for my bootstrap partition?</title>
		<body><p>No. If you are not running a separate boot partition (<path>/boot</path>) then you do not need this line and can safely just delete it from <path>/etc/fstab</path>.  The bootstrap partition is <e>not</e> <path>/boot</path> and is not related in anyway. In general, PowerPC machines do not need a separate <path>/boot</path> partition, and the bootstrap partition should not be mounted.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Installation is now complete. However after rebooting, I am getting different characters than the keys I press on my machine's keyboard. What should I do?</title>
		<body><p>If this is an English keymap, you likely have a kernel config issue. You will need to rebuild your kernel with the following options:
<pre><codenote>In "Input core support" (these are the defaults, but check them)</codenote>
   &lt;*&gt; Input core support
   &lt;*&gt;   Keyboard support 
   &lt;*&gt;   Mouse support
   (1024)   Horizontal screen resolution
   (768)    Vertical screen resolution
   &lt; &gt;   Joystick support
   &lt;*&gt;   Event interface support
</pre><pre>
<codenote>In "Macintosh Device Drivers"</codenote>
   [*] Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support
   [ ]    Include MacIO (CHRP) ADB driver   <codenote>doesn't matter</codenote>
   [*]    Use input layer for ADB devices
   [ ]      Support for ADB raw keycodes    <codenote>turn this OFF</codenote>
   [*]      Support for mouse button 2+3 emulation
</pre>
This way, you will still be able to use <path>/proc/sys/dev/mac_hid</path> to emulate buttons 2 and 3 (see section 18 of the Gentoo PPC Install Guide).</p>
		<p>If, for some reason you do not want to recompile your kernel, append <c>keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes=1</c> to the kernel arguments in <path>yaboot.conf</path>. This will also correct the problem, but might possibly introduce other problems.</p>
		<p>Thanks to Joe McMahon for help with this answer.</p></body>

	<section>
		<title>Installation is now complete. However, after my machine boots into Gentoo and I try to emerge anything, I see errors saying it cannot 'stat' a file. What is wrong?</title>
		<body><p>Check to see that your time is set correctly. Setting your time and linking <path>/etc/localtime</path> to your proper timezone (in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>) will solve your problems. Also make sure that you have <e>not</e> enabled the <e>Enhanced RTC</e> option in the <e>Character devices</e> section of the kernel configuration (as stated in install guide).</p></body>

	<section>
		<title>How do I enable the full processor speed on my PowerBook while running Linux?</title>
		<body><p>Some processors in PowerBooks start up at slower speed than they are designed to run. Running at this slower speed conserves battery life with the tradeoff of performance. The operating system on the machine must instruct the hardware to run at its full speed. In Mac OS X this is called "Reduced processor performance" or "CPU Scaling" in Linux. To check the current speed of your processor while running in Linux, type <c>cat /proc/cpuinfo</c>. In Mac OS X, you first have to turn off "Reduce processor performance" in the "Options" tab of the Energy Saver system preference panel. Then run Apple System Profiler (in Applications:Utilities).</p>
			<warn>Do not use this method to overclock your machine. Results are unpredictable if you use an improper value. We are not responsible if you fry your machine!</warn>
			<p>If Apple System Profiler reports a higher speed than what you get when running in Linux, you can enable the full speed of the processor with a simple command. First, your machine needs to be running kernel 2.4.20-pre9-ben0 or later. Earlier kernels do not have the code necessary to change the processor speed. Second, you will need to compile the kernel with <c>CPU Frequency scaling</c> <e>disabled</e>. Finally, run an appropriate command as shown in the examples below.
<pre>
<codenote>These are examples only. Use values appropriate for your machine.</codenote>

echo "0:667000:1000000:performance" > /proc/cpufreq    <codenote>For a 1ghz PowerBook G4</codenote>
echo "0:667000:800000:performance" > /proc/cpufreq     <codenote>For an 800mhz PowerBook G4</codenote>
</pre>
		Many users will want to add this command to the end of <path>/etc/conf.d/local.start</path>. This file is sourced every time your machine starts.
		</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>I'm running Gentoo on a PowerPC laptop. What packages should I install to enable laptop-specific functionality?</title>
		<body><p>There are four main packages you will need to install.</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li><e>pmud</e> is the Power Management daemon for your hardware (similar to apmd on x86). Please note that pmud may also require a working sound device (<path>/dev/mixer</path>).</li>
				<li><e>pbbuttonsd</e> gives you the use of all the laptop buttons for volume, brightness, etc.</li>
				<li><e>gtkpbbuttons</e> gives you a gtk front end for pbbuttonsd (visual feedback on button presses in X).  <e>gtkpbbuttons</e> requires gtk and should be added to your X session file (<path>~/.Xsession</path>) for best results (so that it is always running while in X).</li>
				<li><e>powerprefs</e> ties together with pbbuttonsd, and gives you the ability to edit settings such as trackpad options and various other preferences.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>These packages can be installed by running the appropriate commands from the list below:
<pre>
# <c>emerge pmud; rc-update add pmud default</c>
# <c>emerge pbbuttonsd; rc-update add pbbuttonsd default</c>
# <c>emerge gtkpbbuttons</c>
# <c>emerge powerprefs</c>
</pre>
			</p></body>

	<section>
		<title>How can I configure my machine's Airport or other Wi-Fi card?</title>
		<body><p>First, make sure you have support for the card complied into the kernel, or compiled as a module and loaded. Then, <c>emerge wireless-tools; iwconfig</c>.</p></body>
	</section>
</chapter>


<chapter>
	<title>Applications</title>

	<section>
		<title>Is there an easy way to configure X?</title>
		<body><p>Thanks to Gerk, you can <c>emerge xeasyconf; Xeasyconf</c>.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>I recently emerged XFree, but when using it, my international keyboard layout does not work correctly. The main keys work fine but I am unable to compose special characters like the "at" sign. The startx output says something like "could not load keymap, falling back to default keymap". What is wrong?</title>
		<body><p>Check that the permissions on <path>/var/tmp</path> are set to <path>drwxrwxrwx</path>. If not, change them by typing <c>chmod a+rwx /var/tmp</c>. This will allow XFree to load keymaps properly again.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>When using OpenGL DRI in XFree or playing movies, the system sometimes freezes hard unexpectedly. What can I do?</title>
		<body><p>Your system may not cope properly with AGP support. Newer kernels (2.4.20 or higher) and XFree 4.3 or better should solve this. Until then the easiest solution is to add the following line to the "Device" section of <path>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</path>:
<pre>
Option       "ForcePCIMode"
</pre></p></body>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>How do I get sound output working?</title>
		<body><p>Two things are needed here. First, you have to make sure that you have the correct kernel options selected.  In make menuconfig you need:
<pre>
&lt;*&gt; Sound card support
&lt;*&gt;   PowerMac DMA sound support
</pre>
			(or selected as modules and loaded). Second, users who should have access to the audio devices need to be added to the appropriate group with the command <c>chmod -g audio [username]</c>. If the dmasound_pmac module does not load, you probably need to enable i2c-core in the kernel or as a module.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>How do I play Audio CDs?</title>
		<body><p>NewWorld machines have no audio connection between their CD-ROM drive and their sound hardware. Therefore, audio information must be read as data and then piped to the sound hardware. This is possible using xmms and the cdread plugin. First, you will need to rebuild your kernel with the following options:
<pre>
<codenote>In "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL Support"</codenote>
<codenote>In "IDE, ATA, and ATAPI Block Devices"</codenote>
   &lt; &gt; Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support  <codenote>turn this OFF</codenote>
   &lt;M&gt; SCSI emulation support           <codenote>compile this as a module</codenote>

<codenote>In "SCSI Support"</codenote>
   &lt;M&gt; SCSI support                     <codenote>compile this as a module</codenote>
   &lt;M&gt; SCSI CD-ROM support              <codenote>compile this as a module</codenote>
</pre>
Then, append <c>hdX=ide-scsi</c> to the kernel image description(s) in <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> where <c>hdX</c> is the IDE device corresponding to your CD player. This is usually <c>hdc</c>. Type <c>mkofboot -v</c> to install the new yaboot.conf settings. Edit <path>/etc/group</path> add any users who should be able to play CDs to the <c>cdrom</c> group. You will now need to reboot your system for the kernel changes to take effect.</p>
		<p>Upon reboot, <c>su</c> to root and change the permissions of the cd device, then install xmms:
<pre>
# <c>chown root.cdrom /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd</c>
# <c>chmod 660 /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd</c>
# <c>emerge xmms xmms-cdread</c>
</pre>
<note>Make sure to use the path corresponding to the CD drive on your machine.</note>
To play a CD, fire up <c>xmms</c> and enter <c>/dev/cdrom</c> as the file you want to play.</p>
		</body>

	<section>
		<title>Can I run Mac OS or Mac OS X under Gentoo Linux?</title>
		<body><p>Yes, as long as your are running Gentoo Linux/PPC on Apple hardware (or a Mac-clone). You will need to run <uri link="http://www.maconlinux.org/">Mac-on-Linux</uri>. Just <c>emerge mol</c>. MOL support Mac OS 7.5.2 to 9.2.2, as well as OS X 10.1 and 10.2. It can take over your full screen, or run in a window.</p></body>

		<title>Can I buy a CD of Gentoo Linux/PPC?</title>
		<body><p>Yes! Several vendors sell Gentoo on CD-ROM. Some even will sell you a complete system with Gentoo pre-installed. These people also bounce back a portion of the profits to the Gentoo project, so buy them while they are hot! <uri link="/main/en/where.xml">Get Gentoo!</uri>.</p>

	<section>
		<title>This FAQ hasn't answered my question. What do I do now?</title>
		<body><p>A good first step is to browse through the relevant <uri link="/main/en/docs.xml">documentation on www.gentoo.org</uri>. Two PPC-specific mailing lists currently exist, <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org/mailman/listinfo/gentooppc-dev">gentooppc-dev</uri> and <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org/mailman/listinfo/gentooppc-user">gentooppc-user</uri>. Both lists are archived online. <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum.php?f=24">Gentoo on PPC</uri> (on forums.gentoo.org) is a open bulletin-board for discussion of all PowerPC issues. Also, there is usually a lively discussion on IRC. Join us on <i>#gentoo-ppc</i> on <i>irc.freenode.net</i>.</p>
