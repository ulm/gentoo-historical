<title>
  How do I verify with Mac OS X the downloaded ISO is not
  corrupted? 
</title>
<body>

<p>
First be sure you did not mount the ftp server with 
<e>Finder</e> and then copy the file with drag'n'drop.  This will corrupt
the ISO.  Instead, use <c>curl</c> (with <c>curl -O
http://path/to/iso</c>).
</p>

<p>
As long as Mac OS X does not offer <c>md5sum</c>, you have to use the
<c>openssl</c> capability to produce an md5 checksum.  Therefore, type in
a Terminal the following:
</p>

<pre caption="md5sum with the help of openssl">
$ <i>openssl md5 /path/to/iso</i>
<comment>This could take some time depending of the size of the ISO and your CPU</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Now compare this output with the appropriate file found on the server
where you downloaded the ISO (the file will end with <path>.md5</path>).
If it is the same, the ISO image downloaded correctly.  Be sure you have 
<e>not</e> mounted it (e.g. with Disk Copy) yet!
</p>

<title>Can I dual-boot Gentoo Linux and Mac OS X?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes you can! In fact, <e>yabootconfig</e> will automatically detect
and setup <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> with Linux, Mac OS X and even
classic Mac OS (see the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml?part=1&amp;chap=9#yaboot">Gentoo Handbook</uri> 
for details on yabootconfig). The trick is in how you partition your hard
drive. Before installing Gentoo, startup with the Mac OS X Install CD.
Use the <c>Disk Utility</c> to partition the drive in your machine into
two or three partitions.  Alternatively use <c>parted</c> from the
recent LiveCD, that can handle HFS and HFS+ partitions.  Furthermore, it
is able to shrink a partition so you don't need to delete your whole
disk.  The first partition should be big enough to contain all your
Linux partitions (root+swap+/home etc.). The format of this partition
does not matter. The second partition should be for OS X.  The third (and
optional) partition should be for classic Mac OS. It is needed only if
you want to put Mac OS 9 on a separate partition.
</p>

<note>
If you want to be able to triple-boot with yaboot, Mac OS 9 needs
to be on a separate partition from your Mac OS X installation.
</note>

<p>
After partitioning, install Mac OS X and Mac OS 9 onto their
respective partitions. Once installation is complete, start following
the <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>.
When you get to the section on partitioning, use <c>mac-fdisk</c> to 
<e>delete</e> the large partition you created for Gentoo. In its place, 
create a bootstrap partition, root, swap, and any other partitions you 
want to use with Gentoo.
</p>

<p>
If you have an OldWorld Macintosh (pre-iMac), follow a similar
procedure as described above. However, use the Mac OS 9 install CD and
the <c>Drive Setup</c> utility. OldWorld machines do not need a
bootstrap partition.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>
  I have an early NewWorld Mac such as the Blue and White G3.  It should be
  compatible with the LiveCD, but on boot it returns an "Unknown or corrupt
  filesystem" error.
</title>
<body>
<p>
  As a workaround, boot into Open Firmware by holding down the Apple + Option +
  O + F keys on startup.  When the prompt appears, type:
</p>
<pre caption="Early NewWorld Mac Open Firmware work around">
<i>boot cd:,\\yaboot</i>
</pre>
<p>
The CD should load as expected afterwards.  Thanks to John Plesmid for this
workaround.

<title>
  I have an OldWorld Macintosh and need to use BootX. However, I am
  having trouble opening the BootX installer archive. What can I do?
</title>
<body>

<p>
You will need a new version of <e>StuffIt Expander</e> to open the archive. You can <uri link="http://www.stuffit.com/expander/download.html">download it</uri>
for free.

<section>
<title>
  Is it possible to boot Gentoo Linux on an OldWorld machine without Mac OS? I 
  would like to have a Mac OS-free machine.
</title>
<body>

<p>
If you have a lot of time to experiment, you could try <uri
link="http://penguinppc.org/projects/quik/">Quik</uri>. <e>Quik</e> is a
bootloader for OldWorld PPC machines. If your machine uses <e>BootX</e>,
you can use <e>Quik</e>; if it uses <e>yaboot</e>, you can't.
<e>Quik</e> can be incredibly difficult to install, and is currently
<e>not</e> working with gcc 3.x (read: Gentoo 1.4 or later), but the
end result is somewhere between "neato" and "breathtaking" because Mac OS
does not have to load. Think yaboot on speed.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to read the <uri
link="http://penguinppc.org/projects/quik/quirks.shtml">Quik quirks
page</uri>. Also see "<uri
link="http://lppcfom.sourceforge.net/fom-serve/cache/574.html">Is Quik

  I have a Beige G3 machine. Can I install Gentoo Linux/PPC on a
  second IDE hard drive?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Early Beige G3 machines (those with a "Rev 1" motherboard with an ATI
RageII+ chip) do not support slave IDE drives. To use a second hard drive
with this machine, you would have to attach it to the internal or external
SCSI connector, use install a PCI IDE card. Later G3 machines do not have
this limitation. See
<uri>http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/G3-ZONE/IDE/index.html</uri> for more
information.

<title>
  When I try and install Gentoo on my PowerBook or iBook the internal
  hard drive does not show up. What should I do?
</title>
<body>

<p>
For a PowerBook, pass <c>hda=1,1,1</c> to the kernel at boot time.
That should solve your problems. You can do this at <e>yaboot</e> prompt
by typing <c>boot hda=1,1,1</c>. Some iBooks need
<c>hda=16383,16,64</c>.

  My /etc/fstab file has /dev/BOOT in it.
  Do I need to setup this line for my bootstrap partition?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. If you are not running a separate boot partition
(<path>/boot</path>) then you do not need this line and can safely just
delete it from <path>/etc/fstab</path>.  The bootstrap partition is
<e>not</e> <path>/boot</path> and is not related in anyway. In general,
PowerPC machines do not need a separate <path>/boot</path> partition,
and the bootstrap partition should not be mounted.

  Installation is now complete. However after rebooting, I am getting
  different characters than the keys I press on my machine's keyboard. What
  should I do?
</title> 
<body>

<p>
If this is an English keymap, you likely have a kernel config issue.
You will need to rebuild your kernel with the following options:
</p>

<pre caption="Input core support">
<comment>(these are the defaults, but check them)</comment>
&lt;*&gt; Input core support
&lt;*&gt;   Keyboard support 
&lt;*&gt;   Mouse support
(1024)   Horizontal screen resolution
(768)    Vertical screen resolution
&lt; &gt;   Joystick support
&lt;*&gt;   Event interface support
</pre>

<pre caption="Macintosh Device Drivers">
[*] Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support
[*]    Use input layer for ADB devices
[*]      Support for mouse button 2+3 emulation
</pre>

<p>
This way, you will still be able to use <path>/proc/sys/dev/mac_hid</path> to 
emulate buttons 2 and 3 (see next question).
</p>

<p>
If, for some reason you do not want to recompile your kernel, append
<c>keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes=1</c> to the kernel arguments in
<path>yaboot.conf</path>. This will also correct the problem, but might
possibly introduce other problems.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Joe McMahon for help with this answer.

  I only have one mouse-button.  How can I make use of the second and
  third one, since ctrl-button does not work?
</title>
<body>

<p>
There is no way to get ctrl-button, like on Mac OS X, working.  But
you can map quite any key or combination of keys to emulate the second
and third mouse-button.  The values can be obtained with the command
line utility <c>showkey</c>.  The mouse button emulation is switched on
using the proc-device.  First run <c>echo "1" >
/proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation</c>.  Then copy the right
keycodes to <path>mouse_button2_keycode</path> and
<path>mouse_button3_keycode</path>.  To keep the settings after reboot,
write them to <path>/etc/sysctl.conf</path>.  Here is an example using
F11 and F12:
</p>

<pre caption="Mouse button emulation with F11 and F12">
# Enable mouse button emulation
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button_emulation = 1
# Set 2nd button to 87 - F11
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button2_keycode = 87
# Set 3rd button to 88 - F12
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button3_keycode = 88
</pre>

<p>
Other keys are 100 and 126 for the combinations fn+alt and fn+apple.
</p>

  Installation is now complete. However, after my machine boots into
  Gentoo and I try to emerge anything, I see errors saying it cannot 'stat'
  a file. What is wrong?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Check to see that your time is set correctly. Setting your time and
linking <path>/etc/localtime</path> to your proper timezone (in
<path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>) will solve your problems. Also make
sure that you have <e>not</e> enabled the <e>Enhanced RTC</e> option in
the <e>Character devices</e> section of the kernel configuration (as
stated in install guide).

  How do I enable the full processor speed on my PowerBook while running Linux?
</title>
<body>
<note>
Most (if not all) processors should now work at the correct speed with modern 
kernels.  If you still have this problem, you should upgrade to the latest 
kernel and try again, only use this as a backup solution.
</note>

<p>
Some processors in PowerBooks start up at slower speed than they are
designed to run. Running at this slower speed conserves battery life
with the tradeoff of performance. The operating system on the machine
must instruct the hardware to run at its full speed. In Mac OS X this is
called "Reduced processor performance" or "CPU Scaling" in Linux. To
check the current speed of your processor while running in Linux, type
<c>cat /proc/cpuinfo</c>. In Mac OS X, you first have to turn off
"Reduce processor performance" in the "Options" tab of the <e>Energy Saver</e>
system preference panel. Then run <e>Apple System Profiler</e> (in
Applications:Utilities).
</p>

<warn>
Do not use this method to overclock your machine. Results are
unpredictable if you use an improper value. We are not responsible if
you fry your machine!
</warn>

<p>
If <e>Apple System Profiler</e> reports a higher speed than what you
get when running in Linux, you can enable the full speed of the
processor with a simple command. First, your machine needs to be running
kernel <c>2.4.20-pre9-ben0</c> or later. Earlier kernels do not have the
code necessary to change the processor speed. Second, you will need to
compile the kernel with <c>CPU Frequency scaling</c> <e>disabled</e>.
Finally, run an appropriate command as shown in the examples below.
</p>

<pre caption="CPU Frequency scaling">
<comment>(These are examples only. Use values appropriate for your machine.)</comment>

echo "0:667000:1000000:performance" > /proc/cpufreq    <comment>(For a 1ghz PowerBook G4)</comment>
echo "0:667000:800000:performance" > /proc/cpufreq     <comment>(For an 800mhz PowerBook G4)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Many users will want to add this command to the end of
<path>/etc/conf.d/local.start</path>. This file is sourced every time
your machine starts.

  I'm running Gentoo on a PowerPC laptop. What packages should I
  install to enable laptop-specific functionality?
</title>
<body>

<p>
There are three main packages you will need to install.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <e>pbbuttonsd</e> is a tool that enables the brightness and volume
    keys on most ppc laptops.  The current versions also work as a
    powermanager.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>gtkpbbuttons</e> gives you a gtk front end for pbbuttonsd
    (visual feedback on button presses in X).  <e>gtkpbbuttons</e>
    requires gtk and should be added to your X session file
    (<path>~/.Xsession</path>) for best results (so that it is always
    running while in X).
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>powerprefs</e> ties together with pbbuttonsd, and gives you the
    ability to edit settings such as power-management, trackpad options
    and various other preferences.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>cpudyn</e> allows cpu speed scaling for longer battery life.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These packages can be installed by running the appropriate commands from the 
list below:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing laptop-specific packages">
# <i>emerge pbbuttonsd; rc-update add pbbuttonsd default</i>
# <i>emerge gtkpbbuttons</i>
# <i>emerge powerprefs</i>
# <i>emerge cpudyn</i>
</pre>

<note>
You should edit your <path>/etc/pbbuttonsd.conf</path> to your
preference.  Especially the behaviour of the Fx-keys, as pbbuttonsd
gives you the availabilty, to use the Fx-keys in the first mode, and the
brightness- and sound-keys with the help of Fn.
</note>

<p>
It is useful to add pbbuttonsd and cpudyn to your boot runlevel so that they're
started when your computer starts.  To do this:
</p>
<pre caption="Adding pbbuttonsd and cpudyn to the boot runlevel">
# <i>rc-update add pbbuttonsd boot</i>

<title>How can I configure my machine's Airport or other Wi-Fi card?</title>
<body>

<p>
First, make sure you have support for the airport card compiled into
the kernel, or compiled as a module and loaded. Changing the wireless settings
is accomplished using iwconfig.  This is part of the 
<c>wireless-tools</c> package.
</p>

<p>
As an example of using iwconfig, to set your SSID to home_ssid:
</p>
<pre caption="Setting an SSID">
# iwconfig wlan0 essid home_ssid
</pre>

<p>
Where wlan0 is your wifi card's device name.  For Airport users, the wifi device
is often eth1.  For more details on iwconfig, refer to its man page.
</p>

<note>
Airport Extreme cards are not yet supported on Linux.

<title>Does sleep work on my iBook/PowerBook?</title>
<body>
<p>
Sleep (suspend to ram) works very well on all G3 iBooks and TiBooks.  Recently,
a kernel patch has been released that adds sleep support for G4 iBooks and 
Radeon based AlBooks.  If you have one of these laptops, please see this forum
thread for more details: <uri>http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=254232</uri>.  Additionally, this patch is included with gentoo-sources-2.6.11 and will
be included with vanilla-sources-2.6.12.
</p>
<note>
Note that the 12" PowerBook is not yet supported due to its nVidia chipset.

<title>I can't emerge a package, and get an error about it being masked.  What should I do?</title>
<body>
<p>
There are two common reasons why a package will not emerge: either it hasn't
been tested on PPC or it has been tested, but hasn't yet been marked stable.
</p>
<p>
If your package hasn't yet been tested on PPC, youll need to first mark the
ebuild with the ppc keyword.  This is done using the ekeyword tool which is 
part of the gentoolkit-dev package.  To mark the ebuild ppc:
</p>
<pre caption="Adding the ppc keyword to app-foo/bar">
	ekeyword ppc /usr/portage/app-foo/bar/bar-1.0.ebuild
</pre>
<p>
Once the ebuild has been keyworded, you can now emerge it as usual.  Test the
application and if it works, <b>please</b> report it as a bug so one of the 
developers can add the keyword.
</p>
<note>
This change will only last until the next sync.  If you need a more permanant 
fix, you can maintain a portage overlay.  See the portage documentation for 
more information.
</note>
<p>
If your package already has the ~ppc keyword, you have two options.  Either
follow the above instructions and replace the ~ppc keyword with ppc, or you can
use /etc/portage to unmask the specific package.
</p>
<pre caption="Using /etc/portage to unmask app-foo/bar">
	echo "=app-foo/bar-1.0 ~ppc" > /etc/portage/package.keywords
</pre>
<note>
If the /etc/portage directory does not exist, make sure to create it first.
</note>
<p>
Now emerge the package as normal.  Once you're sure the app is stable, <b>please
</b> report this as a bug so the developers can add the keyword.

<title>Does Gentoo/PPC have support for Flash?</title>
<body>
<p>
No, Macromedia has not supplied a linux/ppc binary and until Macromedia opens
the flash format or provides a binary flash will not work on ppc.  A possible 
work around is to use qemu (an x86 emulator) to run the Macromedia Flash Player
6 stand alone player.  This is described here:

<title>Is there an easy way to configure X?</title>
<body>

<p>
Simply emerge <c>Xautoconfig</c>.  Once the package has been emerged, run
Xautoconfig to generate the config for your setup.  To enable DRM, you may need
to do further tweaking, see the sections below.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>How can I enable Direct Rendering (DRM) on rage128 or radeon cards?</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure in your kernel config you have the following options set:
</p>

<pre caption="DRM kernel configuration">
Device Drivers - Character devices ---&gt;
  &lt;*&gt; /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)
  [*] Apple UniNorth support
  [*] Direct Rendering Manager (DRI support)
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Rage 128
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Radeon
Device Drivers - Graphics Support ---&gt;
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Rage 128 display support
  &lt;*&gt;   ATI Radeon display support 
</pre>

<p>
Rebuild and install the kernel if necessary. After this, make sure you
have booted to the native framebuffer (i.e. radeonfb or atyfb and
<e>not</e> from offb or ofonly video), and run <c>Xautoconfig</c>.
</p>

<impo>
You may need to edit your <path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path> file depending
on your card setup. Ensure that the device driver selected is either 
ati or your specific driver (r128 or radeon).  Also check that the
DRI extension is loaded and not commented out.
</impo>
<note>
There currently isn't any DRI support for the R300/R400 chipsets, a
project has been started at <uri>http://r300.sourceforge.net</uri>.
nVidia chipsets are also mostly unsupported on PPC, there is basic
support provided by the nv driver, but no 3D acceleration.

  I recently emerged Xorg, but when using it, my international
  keyboard layout does not work correctly. The main keys work fine but I am
  unable to compose special characters like the "at" sign. The startx output
  says something like "could not load keymap, falling back to default
  keymap". What is wrong?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Check that the permissions on <path>/var/tmp</path> are set to
<path>drwxrwxrwx</path>. If not, change them by typing <c>chmod a+rwx
/var/tmp</c>. This will allow Xorg to load keymaps properly again.

<title>How do I get sound playback working?</title>
<body>

<p>
There are two approaches to sound on modern kernels either OSS or ALSA.  OSS 
is the older of the two options and has been depreciated, but still functions
well for many older Macs.  ALSA is the newer method and will continue to be 
supported in the future.  We recommend that you use ALSA unless you have
problems.
</p>

<note>
If you include the OSS driver in your kernel, the ALSA driver will not load.
</note>

<p>
In addition to configuring the kernel, users who should have access to the 
audio devices need to be added to the appropriate group with the command:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding users to the audio group">
# <i>gpasswd -a username audio</i>
</pre>

<p>
If the kernel is set up correctly, but you can't hear any sound, ensure that
the main mixer volume is turned up and that the device isn't muted!
</p>

<note>
At this time, there is no support for the sound card provided with the G5.
The Mac Mini is only supported with a hack.  See <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-297244.html">this</uri> forum thread for more details on sound
on the Mac Mini.

<section>
<title>Sound setup with ALSA</title>
<body>
<p>
For ALSA, we'll set up both the regular ALSA drivers and the OSS emulation
layer so that we can still use legacy OSS only programs.  In <c>make 
menuconfig</c> you'll need to select:
</p>

<pre caption="Kernel options for ALSA">

<title>Sound setup with OSS</title>
<body>
<p>
In <c>make menuconfig</c> you'll need to select:
</p>

<pre caption="Kernel options for OSS">
&lt;*&gt; Sound card support
  &lt;*&gt;   PowerMac DMA sound support
</pre>

<p>
(or configure as modules and ensure they're loaded on boot).
</p>

<p>
If the <c>dmasound_pmac</c> module does not load, you probably need to
enable <c>i2c-core</c> in the kernel or as a module.

<title>How do I play Audio CDs?</title>
<body>

<p>
NewWorld machines have no audio connection between their CD-ROM drive
and their sound hardware. Therefore, audio information must be read as
data and then piped to the sound hardware. This is possible using
<e>xmms</e> and the <e>xmms-cdread</e> plugin, that reads the audio off
the CD over the ATA cable, decodes it in software and sends it to the
sound card over the PCI bus as digital data.  If you want 'true'
cd-playing, you have to do the following steps:
</p>

<p>
First, you will need to rebuild your kernel with the following options:
</p>

<pre caption="Kernel options for playing audio-CDs">
<comment>(In "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL Support")</comment>
<comment>(In "IDE, ATA, and ATAPI Block Devices")</comment>
&lt; &gt; Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support  <comment>(turn this OFF)</comment>
&lt;M&gt; SCSI emulation support           <comment>(compile this as a module)</comment>

<comment>(In "SCSI Support")</comment>
&lt;M&gt; SCSI support                     <comment>(compile this as a module)</comment>
&lt;M&gt; SCSI CD-ROM support              <comment>(compile this as a module)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Then, append <c>hdX=ide-scsi</c> to the kernel image section(s) in
<path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> where <c>hdX</c> is the IDE device
corresponding to your CD player. This is usually <c>hdc</c>. Type
<c>ybin -v</c> to install the new yaboot.conf settings. Edit
<path>/etc/group</path> add any users who should be able to play CDs to
the <c>cdrom</c> group. You will now need to reboot your system for the
kernel changes to take effect.
</p>

<p>
Upon reboot, <c>su</c> to root and change the permissions of the cd device, 
then install xmms:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing permission for cdrom and install xmms-read">
# <i>chown root:cdrom /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd</i>
# <i>chmod 660 /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd</i>
# <i>emerge xmms xmms-cdread</i>
</pre>

<note>
Make sure to use the path corresponding to the CD drive on your machine.
</note>

<p>
To play a CD, fire up <c>xmms</c> and enter <c>/dev/cdrom</c> as the
file you want to play.

<title>Can I run Mac OS or Mac OS X under Gentoo Linux?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, as long as your are running Gentoo Linux/PPC on Apple hardware
(or a Mac-clone). You will need to run <uri
link="http://www.maconlinux.org/">Mac-on-Linux</uri>. Just <c>emerge
mol</c>. MOL support Mac OS 7.5.2 to 9.2.2, as well as any version of OS X.
It can take over your full screen, or run in a window.
</p>

<note>
To run MOL fullscreen, you'll need to compile MOL with the fbcon use flag 
enabled.
</note>

<p>
For networking and sound you might install the drivers in the folder
<path>MOL-Install</path> on your Mac OS X-Desktop.  If errors with
networking occur, make sure you have the following kernel options
enabled:
</p>

<p>
For the dhcp server:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Socket Filtering (CONFIG_FILTER)</li>
  <li>Packet Socket (CONFIG_PACKET)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For NAT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network packet filtering (CONFIG_NETFILTER)</li>
  <li>Connection tracking (CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK)</li> 
  <li>IP tables support (CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES)</li> 
  <li>Packet filtering (CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER)</li> 
  <li>Full NAT (CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT)</li>
  <li>MASQUERADE target support (CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE)</li>
</ul>

<title>Can I access my ext2/ext3 partitions from OSX?</title>
<body>
<p>
OSX can support the reading and writing of ext2/ext3 partitions by using the 
kernel extension provided by the <uri link="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsx">ext2fsx project.</uri>
</p>
<note>
When using MOL, you cannot access a partition that is currently being used by
Linux.

<title>Which Portage USE flags do not work on PowerPC machines?</title>
<body>
<p>
If you're using an old flat profile, (pre 2005.0) look at <path>/etc/make.profile/use.mask</path> for a list.
</p>
<p>
If you're using a cascaded profile, (2005.0 and onwards) look at <path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/ppc/use.mask</path> for a list.

<title>How can I set up distcc with my x86 box?</title>
<body>
<p>
If you've got another faster computer, you can set up distcc to compile binaries
for your slower ppc processor.  It's better to do as much building as possible
on the faster machine, if possible, don't even build on the slower computer. 
With that said, here are a few links to get you started:

<title>Why does gcc keep segfaulting during ebuilds?</title>
<body>
<p>
If gcc segfaults during ebuilds, this probably isn't a bug with gcc and isn't
even a problem with your hardware.  Most of the time this problem is due to
kernel preemption being enabled.  Although this option is safe on x86, it can
cause cache corruption on PPC which is why it is noticed most frequently during
compiles.  To prevent this from happening, simply recompile the kernel with
preempt turned off.  To check if preempt is enabled:
</p>

<pre caption="Check if preempt is enabled">
$ <i>grep PREEMPT /usr/src/linux/.config</i>
</pre>
<p>
If returns: "# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set", then you should report the 
segfault as a bug.
</p>
<p>
If it returns: "CONFIG_PREEMPT=y", then you'll need to disable it and rebuild
your kernel.

<title>Can I buy a CD of Gentoo Linux/PPC?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes! We sell Gentoo on CD-ROM in our <uri link="http://store.gentoo.org/">Gentoo
store</uri>.  You can choose between CDs with precompiled packages for generic 
ppc hardware, or optimized for G3 and G4 processors, or a KDE/GNOME LiveCD that 
boots directly in a live Gentoo Linux environment.

<title>This FAQ hasn't answered my question. What do I do now?</title>
<body>

<p>
A good first step is to browse through the relevant <uri
link="/doc/en/index.xml">documentation on www.gentoo.org</uri>. Two
PPC-specific <uri link="/main/en/lists.xml">mailing lists</uri>
currently exist, gentoo-ppc-dev and gentoo-ppc-user.  <uri
link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum.php?f=24">Gentoo on PPC</uri>
(on forums.gentoo.org) is an open bulletin-board for discussion of all
PowerPC issues. Also, there is usually a lively discussion on IRC. Join
us on <c>#gentoo-ppc</c> on <c>irc.freenode.net</c>.
