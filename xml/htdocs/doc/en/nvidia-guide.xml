<abstract>
Many Gentooists have an nVidia chipset on their system. nVidia provides specific
Linux drivers to boost the performance of your card. This guide informs you how
to install and configure these drivers.

<title>Introduction</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The nVidia drivers in the tree are released by nVidia and are built against the
Linux kernel. They contain a binary blob that does the heavy lifting for talking
to the card. The drivers consist of two parts, a kernel module, and an X11
driver. Both parts are included in a single package. Due to the way nVidia has
been packaging their drivers, you will need to make some choices before you
install the drivers.
</p>

<p>
Currently, there are two driver packages in the tree, though this will be
reduced to just one package in the near future. The first,
<c>nvidia-drivers</c>, contains the latest drivers from nVidia with support for
<e>all</e> cards, with several versions available depending on how old your
card is. It uses an eclass to detect what kind of card you're running so that it
installs the proper version. The second package, <c>nvidia-legacy-drivers</c>,
supports older cards. It is deprecated in favor of the all-inclusive
<c>nvidia-drivers</c> package, which contains the same driver version(s). <b>Do
not install <c>nvidia-legacy-drivers</c></b>; it's only kept in the tree to give
its current users time to switch over to the new package. You should only use
<c>nvidia-drivers</c>, as explained in the next chapter.
</p>

<note>
Previously, Gentoo provided separate ebuilds for the nVidia kernel module
(<c>nvidia-kernel</c>) and the X11 GLX libraries (<c>nvidia-glx</c>). These
ebuilds have since been removed from the Portage tree in favor of
<c>nvidia-drivers</c>. If you use <c>nvidia-kernel</c> and <c>nvidia-glx</c>,
then you should migrate to the newer packages.
</note>

<chapter>
<title>Driver compatibility</title>
<section>
<title>Which version?</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>nvidia-drivers</c> package supports the full range of available nVidia
cards. Multiple versions are available for installation, depending on the
card(s) you have.
</p>

<p>
Newer cards such as the GeForce 8, 7, 6, and FX 5 series should use the newer
drivers from the 100.x series.
</p>

<p>
Older cards such as the GeForce 3 or GeForce 4
series require the 96xx drivers. For these cards, you should mask
<c>>=x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-1.0.9700</c> in your
<path>/etc/portage/package.mask</path> file. This will prevent newer versions of
the driver which are incompatible with your card from being installed.
</p>

<p>
Old NV2x-based cards (such as TNT, TNT2, GeForce, and GeForce 2) require the
older 71xx drivers (such as <c>nvidia-drivers-1.0.7185</c>). For these cards,
you should mask <c>>=nvidia-drivers-1.0.8700</c> in
<path>/etc/portage/package.mask</path>.
</p>

<p>
You can check for driver compatibility for your card at to determine which
driver supports it at
<uri>http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/100.14.11/README/appendix-a.html</uri>.
</p>

<impo>
The <c>nvidia-legacy-drivers</c> package is deprecated and should not be
installed on a fresh system.  Although it is a 71xx driver, the corresponding
71xx driver version found in <c>nvidia-drivers</c> should be used instead.
</impo>

<title>Configuring your Card</title>
<section>
<title>Kernel Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
As mentioned above, the nVidia kernel driver installs and runs against your
current kernel. It builds as a module, so it makes sense that your kernel must
support the loading of kernel modules. If you used <c>genkernel all</c> to
configure the kernel for you, then you're all set. If not, double check your
kernel configuration so that this support is enabled:
</p>

<pre caption="Enabling the Loading of Kernel Modules">
Loadable module support ---&gt;
  [*] Enable loadable module support
</pre>

<p>
You also need to enable <e>Memory Type Range Register</e> in your kernel:
</p>

<pre caption="Enabling MTRR">
Processor and Features ---&gt;
  [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
</pre>

<p> Also, if you have an AGP graphics card, you can optionally enable
<c>agpgart</c> support to your kernel, either compiled in or as a module. If
you do not use the in-kernel agpgart, then the drivers will use their own
<c>agpgart</c> implementation, called <c>NvAGP</c>.  On certain systems, this
performs better than the in-kernel agpgart, and on others, it performs worse.
You will need to evaluate this on your own system to get the best performance.
If you are unsure what to do, use the in-kernel agpgart:
</p>

<pre caption="Enabling agpgart">
Device Drivers ---&gt;
Character devices ---&gt;
&lt;*&gt; /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)
</pre> 

<note>
On amd64, the IOMMU controls the agpgart setting.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Arch-specific notes</title>
<body>

<impo>
For x86 and AMD64 processors, the in-kernel driver conflicts with the binary
driver provided by nVidia. If you will be compiling your kernel for these CPUs,
you must completely remove support for the in-kernel driver as shown:
</impo>

<pre caption="Remove the in-kernel driver">
Device Drivers ---&gt;
Graphics Support ---&gt;
&lt; &gt;   nVidia Framebuffer Support
&lt; &gt;   nVidia Riva support
</pre>

<p>
A good framebuffer alternative is <c>VESA</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Enable VESA support">
Device Drivers ---&gt; 
Graphics Support ---&gt;
&lt;*&gt;   VESA VGA graphics support
</pre>

<p>
Then, under "VESA driver type" select either <c>vesafb</c> or
<c>vesafb-tng</c>. If you are using an AMD64 processor, you should select
<c>vesafb</c> rather than <c>vesafb-tng</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Select framebuffer type">
(X) vesafb
( ) vesafb-tng
</pre>

<p>
For more information, you can read up
<path>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt</path> if you are using
<c>vesafb</c> or look for your framebuffer documentation under
<path>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/</path>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Continuing with Kernel Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>nvidia-drivers</c> ebuild automatically discovers your kernel version
based on the <path>/usr/src/linux</path> symlink. Please ensure that you have
this symlink pointing to the correct sources and that your kernel is correctly
configured. Please refer to the "Configuring the Kernel" section of the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/">Installation Handbook</uri> for details on configuring
your kernel.
</p>

<p>
First, you'll need to emerge <c>eselect</c> (if you don't already have it). If
you are using <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.18-r4</c>, your kernel listing might look
something like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Check your /usr/src/linux symlink">
# <i>eselect kernel list</i>
Available kernel symlink targets:
  [1]   linux-2.6.18-gentoo-r4 *
  [2]   linux-2.6.20-gentoo-r7
  [3]   linux-2.6.20-gentoo-r8
<comment>(Verify that the right kernel is marked with an asterisk</comment>
</pre>

<p>
In the above output, you'll notice that the <c>linux-2.6.18-gentoo-r4</c> kernel
is marked with an asterisk (<b>*</b>) to show that it is the symlinked kernel.
</p>

<p>
If the symlink is not pointing to the correct sources, you must update the link
by selecting the number of your desired kernel sources, as in the example
above.
</p>

<pre caption="Create/Update /usr/src/linux symlink">
<comment>(Select the correct kernel)</comment>
# <i>eselect kernel set 1</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Installing the Appropriate Drivers</title>
<body>

<p>
Now it's time to install the drivers.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing the nVidia drivers">
# <i>emerge nvidia-drivers</i>
</pre>

<note>
The newer 100.x drivers can be installed with the <c>gtk</c> USE flag set. This
will install <c>media-video/nvidia-settings</c>, a handy graphical tool for
monitoring and configuring several aspects of your nVidia card.
</note>

<impo>
Every time you <uri link="/doc/en/kernel-upgrade.xml">compile a new kernel</uri>
or recompile the current one, you will need to run <c>emerge nvidia-drivers</c>
to reinstall the nVidia modules. An easier way to keep track of modules
installed by ebuilds (such as <c>nvidia-drivers</c>) is to install
<c>sys-kernel/module-rebuild</c>. Once you've installed it, simply run
<c>module-rebuild populate</c> to populate its database with a list of packages
to be rebuilt. Once you've finished compiling or recompiling a kernel, just run
<c>module-rebuild rebuild</c> to rebuild the drivers for your new kernel.
</impo>

<p>
Once the installation has finished, run <c>modprobe nvidia</c> to load the
kernel module into memory. If this is an upgrade, you should remove the
previous module first.
</p>

<pre caption="Loading the kernel module">
# <i>lsmod | grep nvidia &amp;&amp; rmmod nvidia</i>
# <i>modprobe nvidia</i>
</pre>

<p>
To prevent you having to manually load the module on every bootup, you probably
want to have this done automatically each time you boot your system, so edit
<path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path> and add <c>nvidia</c> to it.
Don't forget to run <c>update-modules</c> afterwards.
</p>

<impo>
If you compiled <c>agpgart</c> as a module, you will need to add it to
<path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path>.
</impo>

<pre caption="Running update-modules">
# <i>update-modules</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Configuring the X Server</title>
<body>

<p>
Once the appropriate drivers are installed you need to configure your X Server
to use the <c>nvidia</c> driver instead of the default <c>nv</c> driver.
</p>

<p>
Open <path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path> with your favorite editor (such as
<c>nano</c> or <c>vim</c>) and go to the <c>Device</c> section. In that
section, change the <c>Driver</c> line:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing nv to nvidia in the X Server configuration">
Section "Device"
  Identifier "nVidia Inc. GeForce2"
  <i>Driver     "nvidia"</i>
  VideoRam   65536
EndSection
</pre>

<p>
Then go to the <c>Module</c> section and make sure the <c>glx</c> module gets
loaded while the <c>dri</c> module doesn't:
</p>

<pre caption="Updating the Module section">
Section "Module"
  <comment>(...)</comment>
  <i># Load  "dri"
  Load  "glx"</i>
  <comment>(...)</comment>
EndSection
</pre>

<p>
Next, in section <c>Screen</c>, make sure that either the <c>DefaultDepth</c>
directive is set to 16 or 24, or that you only have <c>Display</c> subsections
with <c>Depth</c> settings of 16 or 24. Without it, the nVidia GLX extensions
will not start.
</p>

<pre caption="Updating the Screen section">
Section "Screen"
  <comment>(...)</comment>
  <i>DefaultDepth 16</i>
  Subsection "Display"
  <comment>(...)</comment>
EndSection
</pre>

<p>
Run <c>eselect</c> so that the X Server uses the nVidia GLX libraries:
</p>

<pre caption="Running eselect">
# <i>eselect opengl set nvidia</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Adding your Users to the video Group</title>
<body>

<p>
You have to add your user to the <c>video</c> group so he has access to the
nVidia device files:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding your user to the video group">
# <i>gpasswd -a youruser video</i>
</pre>

<p>
This might not be totally necessary if you aren't using <c>udev</c> but it
doesn't hurt either and makes your system future-proof.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Testing your Card</title>
<body>

<p>
To test your nVidia card, fire up X and run <c>glxinfo</c>, which is part of the
<c>mesa-progs</c> package. It should say that direct rendering is activated:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the direct rendering status">
$ <i>glxinfo | grep direct</i>
direct rendering: Yes
</pre>

<p>
To monitor your FPS, run <c>glxgears</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Enabling nvidia Support</title>
<body>

<p>
Some tools, such as <c>mplayer</c> and <c>xine-lib</c>, use a local USE flag
called <c>xvmc</c> which enables XvMCNVIDIA support, useful when watching high
resolution movies. Add in <c>xvmc</c> in your USE variable in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path> or add it as USE flag to <c>media-video/mplayer</c>
and/or <c>media-libs/xine-lib</c> in <path>/etc/portage/package.use</path>.
</p>

<p>
There are also some applications that use the <c>nvidia</c> USE flag, so you
may want to add it to <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
Then, run <c>emerge -uD --newuse world</c> to rebuild the applications that
benefit from the USE flag change.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Using NVidia Settings Tool</title>
<body>

<p>
nVidia also provides you with a settings tool. This tool allows you to monitor
and change graphical settings without restarting the X server and is available
through Portage as <c>media-video/nvidia-settings</c>. As mentioned earlier, it
will be pulled in automatically if you install
<c>>=media-video/nvidia-drivers-100.14.09</c> with the <c>gtk</c> USE flag set
in <path>/etc/make.conf</path> or in <path>/etc/portage/package.use</path>.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Troubleshooting</title>
<section>
<title>Getting 2D to work on machines with 4Gb or more memory</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are having troubles with the nVidia 2D acceleration it is likely that
you are unable to set up a write-combining range with MTRR. To verify, check
the contents of <path>/proc/mtrr</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking if you have write-combining enabled">
# <i>cat /proc/mtrr</i>
</pre>

<p>
Every line should contain "write-back" or "write-combining". If you see a line
with "uncachable" in it you will need to change a BIOS setting to fix this.
</p>

<p>
Reboot and enter the BIOS, then find the MTRR settings (probably under "CPU
Settings"). Change the setting from "continuous" to "discrete" and boot back
into Linux. You will now find out that there is no "uncachable" entry anymore
and 2D acceleration now works without any glitches.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>
  When I attempt to load the kernel module I receive a "no such device"
</title>
<body>

<p>
This usually occurs when you don't have a matching video card. Make sure that
you have an nVidia-powered graphical card (you can double-check this using
<c>lspci</c>).
</p>

<p>
If you are confident that you have an nVidia card, check your BIOS and see if
the directive <e>Assign IRQ to VGA</e> is set.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Expert Configuration</title>
<section>
<title>Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
The nVidia driver package also comes with comprehensive documentation. This is
installed into <c>/usr/share/doc</c> and can be viewed with the following
command:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the NVIDIA documentation">
$ <i>less /usr/share/doc/nvidia-drivers-*/README.gz</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Kernel module parameters</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>nvidia</c> kernel module accepts a number of parameters (options) which
you can use to tweak the behaviour of the driver. Most of these are mentioned in
the documentation. To add or change the values of these parameters, edit the
file <c>/etc/modules.d/nvidia</c>. Remember to run <c>update-modules</c> after
modifying this file, and bear in mind that you will need to reload the
<c>nvidia</c> module before the new settings take effect.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Advanced X configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The GLX layer also has a plethora of options which can be configured. These
control the configuration of TV out, dual displays, monitor frequency detection,
etc. Again, all of the available options are detailed in the documentation.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to use any of these options, you need to list them in the relevant
Device section of your X config file (usually <c>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</c>). For
example, suppose I wanted to disable the splash logo:
</p>

<pre caption="Advanced nvidia configuration in the X configuration">
