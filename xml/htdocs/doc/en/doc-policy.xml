			<title>Introduction</title>
			<body>
			
			<p><B>The Gentoo Linux Documentation team aspires to create exceptionally professional
			documentation that is immediately clear and concise to the end user</B>. In order to 
			fulfill this goal, we have very specific rules and guidelines that <e>all</e> 
			documentation must go through before it is published on our website, or otherwise.
			</p>

			<title>Covered Topics</title>

			<p>This policy will cover these topics: </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Documentation Team Organization</li>
			<li>English Developer Guidelines </li>
			<li>Translator Guidelines</li>
			<li>Contact Lists </li>
			</ul>

			<body>
			<p>Before continuing, it is expected that all documentation developers be subscribed to
			the <i>gentoo-doc@gentoo.org</i> mailinglist, and that they are readily available in
			<i>#gentoo-doc</i> at all times.
			</p>

			<p>Additionally, some functional definitions are needed in order to specifically outline
			the duties and responsibilities of the documentation team. </p>

			<p><b>Official Gentoo Linux Documentation</b> is simply defined as any documentation
			that is released by Gentoo Linux for consumption by the end user. The only exceptions to
			this are the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter, and the <i>gentoo.org</i> website, which
			are maintained by their own respective teams. </p>

			<p>Gentoo Linux Documentation can be separated into two categories, critical and
			non-critical documentation. </p>

			<p><b>Critical Documentation</b> is defined as any documentation that is <e>directly</e>
			involved with the installation and base configuration of any Gentoo Linux system.
			To date, our critical documents are: </p>

				<ul>
				<li>All of the Gentoo Linux Installation Guides</li>
				<li>The Desktop Configuration Guide</li>
				<li>The official Gentoo Linux FAQ</li>
				<li>The Gentoo Linux Security Guide</li>
				<li>Any Portage Documentation</li>
				</ul>

			<p><b>Non-critical</b> documentation includes all documentation not specifically defined
			as Critical Documentation. </p>

	<title>Documentation Team Organization</title>
		<section>
			<title>Organization</title>
			<body>
			<p>The Gentoo Linux Documentation team is split into three teams that operate
			in complete cooperation with eachother. The Documentation team is divided into
			these three categories:
			</p>

			<p><b>Technical Writers: </b>The technical writers' function is to completely 
			document every aspect of Gentoo Linux. The writers will periodically be given
			assignments by the Senior Developers, and those assignments are to take precedence
			over any other Gentoo Linux development work. Although the writers' work is
			ultimately proofed by the <b>Editing Team</b>, the writers <e>will still</e>
			proof their own work before submitting it to the <i>gentoo-docs-review@gentoo.org</i>
			mailing list and the <b>Editing Team</b> All technical writers must be subscribed to the
			<i>gentoo-docs-review@gentoo.org</i> mailing list.</p>

			<p><b>Editors/ Proofreaders: </b>The editors are in charge of editing and proofing
			all changes to the Gentoo Linux Documentation. No change can be made unless it is
			verified to be grammatically and syntactically correct by an Editor. The Editors
			must make absolutely sure that <e>all</e> documentation going live on the website
			is as professional and grammatically correct as possible. All Editors must
			be subscribed to the <i>gentoo-docs-review@gentoo.org</i> mailing list.</p>

			<p><b>Translators: </b>Due to the special nature of translations, the translators
			are broken into their own team. Each language will have a lead Developer which will
			serve as the Editor and CVS publisher. Once the lead translator has deemed that
			a translation is ready to go live on the documentation index page, they may add it.
			After the translation is added, a notice must be sent to the <i>gentoo-docs-review@gentoo.org</i>
			mailing list.</p>

<chapter>
	<title>English Developer Guidelines</title>
		<section>
			<title>QA Process</title>
			<body>
			
			<p>The English developer's job is <e>extremely</e> important, as all translations have their roots
			in our English documentation. So, it is imperative that the process described below is followed quite
			pedantically. 
			</p>

			<p>If not done already, the following documents need to be read before continuing:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">The Gentoo Linux XML Guide</uri></li>
			</ul>

			<p>The Gentoo Linux Documentation process can be broken down into several parts:
			</p>
			
			<p><b>The first step to submitting a new document or changing an existing document</b>
			is filing a bug on our <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Bug System</uri>. This serves
			as a notification to other developers and users alike that there is a work in process.
			If there is already a bug in the database that requests a change to the documentation,
			a new bug does not have to be filed.
			</p>

			<p><b>When the proposed new document or change is completed</b>, two courses of action can
			be taken: </p>

			<p>If the change/ bugfix is technical in nature, the revised document, along with its associated
			bug number, must be posted to the <i>gentoo-docs-review@gentoo.org</i> mailinglist for technical
			review. This step is incredibly important, as it ensures the technical accuracy of our documentation.
			The document in question <e>cannot</e> be committed to CVS unless it is submitted for review.</p>

			<p>If the change/ bugfix is grammatical or syntactical in nature, all that is needed is a short note
			to <i>gentoo-docs-review@gentoo.org</i> stating the bug number if applicable, and the fix. </p>
			
			<p><b>Once the document is in CVS</b>, a Senior Developer will be notified, and the Document will
			be posted to the live document index page. </p>

	<title>Translator Guidelines</title>
		<section>
			<title>QA Process</title>
			<body>
			
			<p>Translators will follow the English Developer's QA process, but with the following exceptions:
			</p>

			<p><b>Each language will have a translation team, with an Offical Gentoo Linux Translator</b> as their head.
			All translations will be filtered through this lead person. The lead translator will make certain that the
			translated documents are grammatically and syntactically perfect. The lead translator will have limited CVS 
			access which will enable them to commit documents in a timely manner. </p>
			
			<p>If not done already, the following documents need to be read before continuing:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">The Gentoo Linux XML Guide</uri></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The translator's QA process is as follows:</p>

			<p><b>The first step to submitting a new document or changing an existing document</b>
			is filing a bug on our <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Bug System</uri>. This serves
			as a notification to other developers and users alike that there is a work in process.
			If there is already a bug in the database that requests a change to the documentation,
			a new bug does not have to be filed. </p>

			<p><b>When the proposed new document or change is completed</b>, a notification is to be sent to the
			translation lead, and the translation lead is to make positively sure that the translated document is
			perfect in every way.</p>

			<p><b>Once the document and or change is carefully edited by the lead translator</b>, it can be moved
			into CVS. </p>

			<p><b>Once the document is in CVS</b>, a Senior Developer will be notified, and the Document will
			be posted to the live document index page. </p>
