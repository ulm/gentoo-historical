<title>What is Java?</title>
<section>
<title>Overview</title>
<body>

<p>
Java is a programming language developed by engineers of Sun Microsystems. The
language is object-oriented and designed to run on multiple platforms without
the need of recompiling code for each platform. Although Java can be compiled
as a native program, much of Java's popularity can be attributed to its
portability, along with other features such as garbage collection. To make
platform independence possible the Java compiler compiles the Java code to an
intermediate representation called "Java bytecode" that runs on a JRE (Java
Runtime Environment) and not directly on the operating system.
</p>

<p>
In order to run Java bytecode, one needs to have a JRE (Java Runtime
Environment) installed. A JRE provides core libraries, a platform dependent
Java Virtual Machine, plug-ins for browsers, among other things. A JDK (Java
Development Kit) adds programming tools, such as a bytecode compiler and a
debugger.

Gentoo provides numerous Runtime Environments (JREs) and Development Kits
(JDKs). Among the current choices, we have:

<p>
The default for Java 1.4 is the Blackdown JRE/JDK pair, as it is freely 
("free as in beer") available without any registration fuss.
</p>

<p>
JREs and JDKs from Sun, IBM, and BEA are generally faster, but getting them
is a bit more work, as you are required to read and accept their license before
downloading (IBM additionally requires you to register).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Installing a JRE/JDKs</title>
<body>

<p>
To install your profile's default JDK, you can run <c>emerge virtual/jdk</c>.
Or to install your profile's default JRE, you can <c>emerge virtual/jre</c>.
</p>

<p>
In recent events, Sun has relicensed their JDK and JRE under a more Linux
distro friendly license. As a result, Sun releases Java 1.5 and onwards are
freely downloadable, without any further hassle.
</p>

<note>
A JDK also includes a JRE, so if you install a JDK you shouldn't have to also
have to install a JRE.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Installing fetch-restricted virtual machines</title>
<body>

<p>
As already mentioned, some of the JDKs and JREs require you to jump through a
few hoops before installing. Simply emerge the packages as you normally would.
The ebuilds will then instruct you where to go and what to download.
</p>

<p>
You should download the indicated file(s) into
<path>/usr/portage/distfiles</path>. Once there, you can rerun the emerge
command, at which point the JRE/JDK will be begin to install.
</p>

</body>

<chapter>
<title>Configuring your virtual machine</title>
<section>
<title>Overview</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo has the ability to have multiple JDKs and JREs installed without causing
conflicts.
</p>

<p>
Using the <c>java-config</c> tool, you can set the system-wide default
(provided you have root access). Users can also use <c>java-config</c> to set
up their own personal default.
</p>

<note>
You can also use <e>eselect</e> to change the system and user vm.  See
<c>eselect java-vm help</c>.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Setting a default virtual machine</title>
<body>

<p>
Running the command <c>java-config --list-available-vms</c> will give you a
list of all JREs and JDKs installed on your system. Here is an example of
output:
</p>

<pre caption="Listing available VMs">
# <i>java-config --list-available-vms</i>
The following VMs are available for generation-2:
1)      Blackdown JDK 1.4.2.03 [blackdown-jdk-1.4.2]
2)      Blackdown JRE 1.4.2.03 [blackdown-jre-1.4.2]
3)      Blackdown 32bit JRE 1.4.2.03 [emul-linux-x86-java-1.4.2]
4)      Sun 32bit JRE 1.5.0.08 [emul-linux-x86-java-1.5]
5)      Kaffe 1.1.7 [kaffe]
*)      Sun JDK 1.5.0.08 [sun-jdk-1.5]
</pre>

<p>
The <e>*</e> indicates this is the current active vm (system-vm or user-vm when
set). The name in the brackets (<e>[]</e>) is the handle or ID for that
particular VM. You use the handle or the number to <c>java-config
--set-system-vm</c>. Here is an example of how to set the system VM.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the System VM">
<comment>(By handle (preferred))</comment>
# <i>java-config --set-system-vm blackdown-jdk-1.4</i>
Now using blackdown-jdk-1.4 as your generation-2 system JVM
<comment>(By number)</comment>
# <i>java-config --set-system-vm 6</i>
Now using sun-jdk-1.5 as your generation-2 system JVM
</pre>

<p>
As a regular user, you can use <c>java-config --set-user-vm</c>.
</p>

<note>
You no longer have to <c>source</c> the profile for updates to the user/system
VM take place.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section id="preferred-vm">
<title>Preferred VM</title>
<body>

<p>
While merging Java packages, the VM can and will be switched as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Because of the wide variety of available VMs, we do not have the resources to
test and verify every package works on all of them. So to ensure that every
packages merges smoothly, we have defined a list of <e>default/supported
VMs</e> per arch. You can find them in
<path>/usr/share/java-config/config/jdk-defaults.conf</path>. When you are
merging a Java package, and it detects one of the VM in that file is installed,
it will automatically use that VM, instead of the system-vm.
</p>

<p>
The merge time VM switching is also needed when, for example, your system-vm is
set a 1.4 VM and the package you are merging requires a 1.5 VM. While merging
it will use the preferred 1.5 VM, leaving your system-vm choice intact.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Gentoo is all about choice, so you can override these defaults in
<path>/etc/java-config-2/build/jdk.conf</path> and have complete control over
which VM will get used. Some examples:
</p>

<pre caption="Example /etc/java-config-2/build/jdk.conf">
<comment>(I always want it to use a sun-jdk, ie sun-jdk-1.4 for 1.4, sun-jdk-1.5 for 1.5, etc)</comment>
*=sun-jdk
</pre>

<pre caption="Example /etc/java-config-2/build/jdk.conf">
<comment>(Always use sun-jdk-1.5 wherever possible, except for when a 1.4 or 1.3 VM is explicitly required)</comment>
*=sun-jdk-1.5
</pre>

<pre caption="Example /etc/java-config-2/build/jdk.conf">
<comment># For 1.3 I prefer sun-jdk 1.4 but when it is not available, use ibm-jdk-bin,
# For 1.4, use blackdown-jdk, and for 1.5, use sun-jdk </comment>
1.3=sun-jdk-1.4 ibm-jdk-bin
1.4=blackdown-jdk
1.5=sun-jdk
</pre>

<warn>
You do not have to edit this file. If you change these options to use a
unsupported VM, things could possibly break. Bugs reported with a unsupported
VM won't be prioritized as much as bugs present within supported VMs.
</warn>

<chapter>
<title>Compilers</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The standard Java compiler used for building is javac, which comes with each
JDK. In addition to configuring the VM used at build time, it is also possible
configure which compiler is used. Essentially, you define a list your
preference for which compiler to use in
<path>/etc/java-config-2/build/compilers.conf</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/java-config-2/build/compilers.conf">
# If the ebuild supports it
# it will check the COMPILERS var front to back and
# use the first compiler that is installed

COMPILERS="ecj-3.1 jikes javac"
</pre>

<p>
Some compilers don't support all possible -target and -source arguments.
Therefore, each compiler in the list is checked to see if it can support the
desired -source/-target. javac will work in all cases, so if no other suitable
compiler is found, it will be used instead.
</p>

<p>
More details about each compiler are provided below:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Handle</th>
  <th>Package</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>javac</ti>
  <ti>javac</ti>
  <ti>N/A</ti>
  <ti>
    This is the default compiler that will be used, and comes with each JDK.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>jikes</ti>
  <ti>jikes</ti>
  <ti>dev-java/jikes</ti>
  <ti>
    Jikes was originally developed by IBM. Anecdotally, it is generally quicker
    than javac. Note however, that it is more pedantic, and will fail under a
    few circumstances where javac has no issue. It also does not support Java
    1.5 syntax yet.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>Eclipse Compiler for Java</ti>
  <ti>ecj-3.1</ti>
  <ti>=dev-java/eclipse-ecj-3.1*</ti>
  <ti>
    ECJ is the compiler used by the Eclipse software development kit. It is
    very full featured, and is pretty fast. It does support Java 1.5 syntax.
  </ti>

<chapter>
<title>Setting a default CLASSPATH</title>
<section>
<body>

<warn>
The options explained in this section should be considered deprecated and will
most likely be removed in the future. We strongly recommend against using
these, because your Java projects or application should ideally manage their
own classpaths. If you choose to specify a default CLASSPATH, some applications
may behave unexpectedly, because classes they weren't expecting would be on the
classpath.
</warn>

<p>
<c>java-config</c> can also be used to set a system-wide default CLASSPATH, as
well a user-specific default CLASSPATH.
</p>

<p>
First, you will want to list available Java libraries installed on your system
that might want to be put in your CLASSPATH. Here is an example of output:
</p>

<pre caption="Listing classes">
# <i>java-config --list-available-packages</i>
[xerces-2] The next generation of high performance, fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family (/usr/share/xerces-2/package.env)
[junit] Simple framework to write repeatable tests (/usr/share/junit/package.env)
[bsh] BeanShell: A small embeddable Java source interpreter (/usr/share/bsh/package.env)
[bcel] The Byte Code Engineering Library: analyze, create, manipulate Java class files (/usr/share/bcel/package.env)
[log4j] A low-overhead robust logging package for Java (/usr/share/log4j/package.env)
...
</pre>

<p>
Again, the names in brackets (<e>[]</e>) are the IDs that you have to pass to
<c>java-config --set-system-classpath</c>. Here is an example:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting classpaths">
# <i>java-config --set-system-classpath log4j,xerces-2</i>
</pre>

<note>
The current directory (<path>.</path>) will not be part of the system
classpath, as that should be added in your system's login profile.
</note>

<p>
You will have to update your environment by logging out, then in again or
sourcing <path>/etc/profile</path>.
</p>

<p>
For users, <c>java-config --set-user-classpath</c> will create
<path>~/.gentoo/java-env-classpath</path>, which you should then source from
your shell's profile. 
</p>

<pre caption="Sourcing user specific classpath">
<i>if [[ -f "${HOME}/.gentoo/java-env-classpath" ]]; then
       source ${HOME}/.gentoo/java-env-classpath
fi</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you really want a system wide or user default classpath you can add
something like the following to your shell's profile. But we would advise
against it.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting classpath">
# <i>export CLASSPATH="${CLASSPATH}:$(java-config --classpath log4j,xerces-2)"</i> 
</pre>

<title>Java Browser Plug-ins</title>
<section>
<title>Installing a plug-in</title>
<body>

<p>
You can install a Java plug-in for your web browser by emerging a Java VM with
the <c>nsplugin</c> USE flag set.
</p>

<note>
<c>nsplugin</c> is not available for all architectures. Check for available
plug-ins on your arch before trying to install a VM by running <c>emerge -pv
&lt;java-vm&gt;</c>.
</note>

<p>
Portage will allow you to install multiple versions of Java plug-ins, though
only one will be used by your browser. You can check the list of available
plug-ins by running:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing available plug-ins">
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin list</i>
   [1]   sun-jre-bin-1.5
   [2]   blackdown-jre-1.4.2
</pre>

<p>
In this example, <c>sun-jre-bin</c> is selected for the browser plug-in.
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting a plug-in">
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin sun-jre-bin-1.5</i>
</pre>

<p>
Verify that the correct plug-in was selected:
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying the correct plug-in">
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin list</i>
   [1]   sun-jre-bin-1.5  current
   [2]   blackdown-jre-1.4.2
</pre>

<p>
Java.com also provides a link to <uri
link="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">verify your installed
plug-in</uri>. Additionally, if you are using a Mozilla-based browser, you can
verify your Java plug-in by typing <c>about:plugins</c> into the address bar.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Plug-ins on multilib systems</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are running a mixed 64-bit and 32-bit multilib system (for example, on AMD64),
you can have both 64-bit and a 32-bit Java plug-ins installed.
</p>

<p>
First, check which plug-ins are available:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing available plug-ins">
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin list</i>
Available 32-bit Java browser plugins
  [1]   emul-linux-x86-java-1.4.2
  [2]   emul-linux-x86-java-1.5
Available 64-bit Java browser plugins
  [1]   blackdown-jdk-1.4.2
  [2]   blackdown-jre-1.4.2
</pre>

<p>
You can select a 32-bit plug-in for a 32-bit browser (for example,
<c>firefox-bin</c>), and you can select a 64-bit plug-in for your 64-bit
browser (for example, <c>konqueror</c>).
</p>

<pre caption="Selecting plug-ins">
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin set 32bit emul-linux-x86-java-1.4.2</i>
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin set 64bit blackdown-jdk-1.4.2</i>
</pre>

<p>
Verify the correct plug-ins were selected:
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying the correct plug-ins">
# <i>eselect java-nsplugin list</i>
Available 32-bit Java browser plugins
  [1]   emul-linux-x86-java-1.4.2  current
  [2]   emul-linux-x86-java-1.5
