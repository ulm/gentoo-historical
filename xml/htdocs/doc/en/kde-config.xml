<title>What is the K Desktop Environment?</title>
<section>
<title>The Project</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.kde.org">KDE Project</uri> is a free software project
dedicated to the development of KDE, an open source graphical desktop
environment for Linux and Unix workstations. The development is covered by
several hundred software engineers from all over the world committed to free
software development. See also <uri

<title>The Software</title>
<body>

<p>
The K Desktop Environment is an easy to use desktop environment build around a
well-thought application framework to allow for application interoperability,
drag 'n drop, etc. Apart from the necessary components the KDE environment also
provides ready-to-use applications for 101 tasks: file management, Internet
browser, office application, e-mail handling, ... Everything is covered by the
KDE project.
</p>

<p>
The KDE environment is available in more than 70 languages and has an immense
user base. For those interested, there are lots of <uri
link="http://www.kde.org/screenshots/">screen shots</uri> available. For more
information on KDE, read the <uri link="http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/">What is
KDE?</uri> article on <uri link="http://www.kde.org">KDE.org</uri>.

KDE generally. <uri link="http://www.kdedevelopers.org">KDEdevelopers.org</uri>
is targeted at the KDE development specifically, while <uri

<title>Installing KDE</title>
<section>
<title>What do you need?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you're interested in installing KDE (or KDE support), you will
have to make sure that your USE variable contains the <c>kde</c> and <c>qt</c>
flags. For those of you interested, Qt is the graphical widget library KDE
uses.
</p>

<p>
KDE is also able to automatically mount devices for you. To use this feature,
add <c>hal</c> to your USE variable.
</p>

<p>
If you do not want to use <uri link="http://www.arts-project.org/">aRts</uri>
for your all-around multimedia, disable the <c>arts</c> USE flag (it is active
by default).

<title>Installing KDE &lt; 3.4</title>
<body> <!-- TODO Remove this section when 3.4 is stabilized on all archs -->

<p>
Second, you need to think on what you want to install from the KDE distribution.
As mentioned before, KDE is very feature-rich and embraces lots of packages. You
don't have to believe our word for it -- just check yourself :)
</p>

<pre caption="Listing all packages KDE would install">
# <i>emerge --pretend kde | less</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you're not interested in installing all those packages, you can emerge the
individual packages. You will most definitely want the <c>kdebase</c> package as
it contains KDE's base packages and necessities. The following table lists some
available packages you can emerge.

<title>Installing KDE &gt;= 3.4</title> <!-- TODO rename to "Installing KDE" -->
<body>

<p>
More recent KDE versions (from 3.4 onwards) are now represented by a plethora of
<uri link="/doc/en/kde-split-ebuilds.xml">split ebuilds</uri> making it a tad
more difficult to know what to install and what not. Gentoo does provide a few
meta packages that will pull in a certain amount of KDE packages for you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you want a full-blown KDE installation, install <c>kde-meta</c>. 
    This package will pull in all KDE applications as dependencies. 
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want a basic KDE installation, install <c>kdebase-startkde</c>. You
    can always install additional KDE applications when you want.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These two are the extreme limits; you are probably interested in a safe mixture
of the two :) To make the decision process a lot easier on your hands, the
following table gives a short, incomplete yet useful oversight on some of the
available KDE packages.

<p>
And this is just a small tip of the ice berg. If you want to know more about all
possible KDE applications, take a look inside the <uri
link="http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=kde-base">kde-base
category</uri>. Their function should be available in the description.
</p>

<p>
To preview what emerge would install, use <c>emerge -p</c> with the <c>less</c>
pager, otherwise you might not be able to see all packages.
</p>

<pre caption="Previewing the kde installation">
<comment>(Substitute with your choice of package(s))</comment>
# <i>emerge -p kdebase-startkde kicker | less</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you are happy with the proposed result, leave the <c>-p</c> out. This
building process will take some time as KDE is a big environment so don't be
surprised when your system does not finish immediately :-)
</p>

<p>
If you want KDE to auto-mount your devices you'll need to install <c>dbus</c>,
<c>hal</c> and <c>ivman</c> as well after which you add each one of them to the
default run level:
</p>

<pre caption="Setup auto-mounting">
# <i>emerge dbus hal ivman</i>
# <i>rc-update add dbus default</i>
# <i>rc-update add hald default</i>
# <i>rc-update add ivman default</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>First Impressions</title>
<body>

<p>
Now let us take a look at the result. Now your mother has probably told you
never to work as root. So we'll take on your mother's advice and test
KDE as a user. Log in as your user and configure your session so it starts KDE
when you issue <c>startx</c>. You can do this by writing <c>exec startkde</c> in
<path>~/.xinitrc</path> (see also
<uri link="/doc/en/xorg-config.xml#using_startx">Using startx</uri> in the
<uri link="/doc/en/xorg-config.xml">X Server Configuration Howto</uri>):
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring your local session">
$ <i>echo "exec startkde" &gt; ~/.xinitrc</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now start up your graphical environment by running <c>startx</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Starting KDE">
$ <i>startx</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted by an application called <c>KPersonalizer</c>.
Congratulations, let's now take a look at how we can configure KDE...
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Configuring KDE</title>
<section>
<title>KPersonalizer</title>
<body>

<p>
KPersonalizer is the application that configures KDE for you. It's a very
useful wizard that allows you to quickly change KDE to suit your own needs. When
you run KDE for the first time, KPersonalizer is automatically started.
</p>

<p>
The first input KPersonalizer requests is your country and the language of your
choice. As we haven't installed the necessary language packs on your system yet,
the available languages will be very slim -- you'll probably have only English
to choose from. Don't mind this, we will change the language later on (if
applicable of course).
</p>

<p>
The second choice you're offered is the <e>System Behavior</e>. This includes
window activation, mouse selection, etc. When you select a certain behavior
its description is shown to help you choose the behavior you like. If you're
uncertain, don't panic -- you are able to change the behavior whenever you
want.
</p>

<p>
Next KPersonalizer asks for the amount of eye-candy it should activate. The more
eye-candy you want, the funkier your KDE will be, but the more your CPU will be
stressed. However, this should be taken with a bit of salt - on a 600 Mhz CPU
with 128 Mb of memory, enabling full eye candy still results in a responsive
system.
</p>

<p>
Finally, KDE asks what style you want to use. A style defines the window
decoration, theme, button layout, etc. Try several styles to see which one you
like the most. Did we already mention KDE is fully configurable?
</p>

<p>
Now sit back and enjoy -- KDE will start up and you'll be greeted by a nice,
clean, functional desktop environment.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Installing Language Packs</title>
<body>

<p>
If English isn't your native language or you're just interested in working with
KDE in a foreign language, please read on. We will install the language pack(s)
for the language(s) you want to use with KDE.
</p>

<p>
Language packs are contained in the <c>kde-i18n</c> package. To install the
language packs of your choice, you need to set the <c>LINGUAS</c> variable to
the language(s) you want to use. It is advisable to set this variable in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path> so that updating your system doesn't remove the
language packs you want.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting LINGUAS in /etc/make.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/make.conf</i>
<comment>(As an example, we install the language packs for Dutch (nl) 
 and French (fr))</comment>
LINGUAS="nl fr"
</pre>

<p>
Now run <c>emerge kde-i18n</c> to install the language packs. Once settled, fire
up KDE, then start the KDE Control Center (K-menu &gt; Settings &gt; Control
Center). This is <e>the</e> application where you can control almost every
aspect of KDE. It is much more extended than KPersonalizer.
</p>

<p>
To change your language, go to <c>Regional &amp; Accessibility</c>,
<c>Country/Region &amp; Languages</c>. Then add the language(s) of your choice.
To see your (localized) KDE in its full glory, log out and in again, and enjoy.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Graphical Login</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to use <c>kdm</c> as graphical login manager (which means you don't
have to log on onto a terminal and type <c>startx</c> every time) you need
to edit a configuration file and setup your system so that it enters graphical
mode after boot, as explained below.
</p>

<p>
In <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>, set the <c>DISPLAYMANAGER</c> variable to
<c>kdm</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting DISPLAYMANAGER in /etc/rc.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/rc.conf</i>
<comment>(Edit the following variable)</comment>
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
</pre>

<p>
Finish up by adding <c>xdm</c> to the default run level:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding xdm to the default runlevel">
# <i>rc-update add xdm default</i>
</pre>

<p>
When you reboot your system, it will use KDM as graphical login manager.
</p>

<p>
KDM will provide a list of available sessions to choose from, including KDE -
of course - and including all the other sessions installed on your system,
which KDM finds by looking in <path>/usr/share/xsessions/</path>. Thus, if you
use KDM, you don't need to edit <path>~/.xinitrc</path>.

<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<section>
<title>KDE is extremely slow during startup</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure your <path>/etc/hosts</path> file is correct:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you have a static IP address, make sure your FQDN and hostname are
    mentioned on that line, like <c>192.168.0.10 tux.mydomain tux</c>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have a dynamic IP address or you do not have any additional
    interfaces at all, add your hostname after the localhost statement, like
    <c>127.0.0.1 localhost tux</c>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Check if you have DMA enabled for your disks:
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying DMA settings">
# <i>hdparm /dev/hda</i>
<comment>(...)</comment>
using_dma       = 1 (on)
<comment>(...)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
If you don't have an IPv6-enabled network, disable KDE's IPv6 checking by
adding the following line to <path>/etc/env.d/99kde-env</path>:
</p>
