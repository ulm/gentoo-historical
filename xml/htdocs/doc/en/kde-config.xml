<title>What is the K Desktop Environment?</title>
<section>
<title>The Project</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.kde.org">KDE Project</uri> is a free software project
dedicated to the development of KDE, an open source graphical desktop
environment for Linux and Unix workstations. The development is carried out by
several hundred software engineers from all over the world committed to free
software development. See also <uri
link="http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/project.php">What is the KDE Project</uri>.

<title>The Software</title>
<body>

<p>
The K Desktop Environment is an easy-to-use desktop environment built around a
well thought out application framework to allow for application
interoperability, drag n drop and so on. Apart from the essential components,
the KDE environment also provides ready-to-use applications for 101 tasks: file
management, Internet browsing, office applications, e-mail handling, ...
Everything is covered by the KDE project.
</p>

<p>
The KDE environment is available in more than 70 languages and has an immense
user base. For those interested, there are lots of <uri
link="http://www.kde.org/screenshots/">screen shots</uri> available. For more
information on KDE, read the <uri link="http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/">What is
KDE?</uri> article on <uri link="http://www.kde.org">KDE.org</uri>.

KDE generally. <uri link="http://www.kdedevelopers.org">KDEdevelopers.org</uri>
is specifically focussed on KDE development, while <uri

<title>Installing KDE</title>
<section>
<title>What do you need?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you're interested in installing KDE (or KDE support), you will have to make
sure that your USE variable contains the <c>kde</c> flag, and either the
<c>qt3</c> or <c>qt4</c> flag (or both). Qt is the graphical widget library
that KDE uses, and <c>qt3</c> is for version 3.x, while <c>qt4</c> will
build support for the newer Qt 4.x library.
</p>

<p>
You should also add <c>hal</c> to your USE variable now if you want to add support
for mounting devices automatically as explained below in
<uri link="#kde_device_mounting">Setup KDE to Mount Devices</uri>.
</p>

<p>
If you do not want to use <uri link="http://www.arts-project.org/">aRts</uri>
for your all-around multimedia, disable the <c>arts</c> USE flag (it is active
by default).
</p>

<note>
The Gentoo 2006.1 release introduced a number of new profiles, including the
<c>desktop</c> subprofile. You may want to switch to this subprofile, if it
exists for your architecture, as it contains a number of default USE flag
changes. Please read the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-upgrading.xml">Gentoo
Upgrading Guide</uri> to learn how to switch profiles.

<title>Installing KDE as Monolithic Packages</title>
<body>

<p>
The KDE project releases new versions of its desktop environment as a set of
about 16 big packages, each containing many applications (thus they are called
"monolithic"), so you need to decide which of these packages you want to
install.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see what it looks like to have all these packages installed,
just check yourself:
</p>

<pre caption="Listing all packages KDE would install">
# <i>emerge --pretend kde | less</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you're not interested in installing all those packages, you can emerge them
individually. You will most definitely want the <c>kdebase</c> package as it
contains KDE's base packages and required dependencies. The following table
lists some of the other available packages that you can install.

<section>
<title>Installing KDE as Split Packages</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to have even more control on what parts of KDE you install, you
have the possibility to install just the single KDE applications that you need.
To know more about the ebuilds for the individual KDE programs see the <uri
link="/doc/en/kde-split-ebuilds.xml">Split Ebuilds HOWTO</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Knowing what to install and what not is a tad more difficult with split ebuilds.
However, Gentoo does provide a few meta packages that will pull in a certain
amount of KDE packages for you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you want a full-blown KDE installation, install <c>kde-meta</c>. 
    This package will pull in all KDE applications as dependencies. 
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want a basic KDE installation, install <c>kdebase-startkde</c>. You
    can always install additional KDE applications when you want.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These two possibilities are the extreme limits; you are probably interested in
a safe mixture of the two :) To make your decision process somewhat easier, the
following table gives a short, very incomplete yet useful overview of some of
the available KDE packages.
</p>

<p>
These packages are <e>not</e> part of the <c>kdebase-startkde</c> installation.

<title>External KDE applications</title>

<title>First Impressions</title>
<body>

<p>
Let us have a look at the result. Your mother has probably told you
never to work as root. So we'll take your mother's advice and test
KDE as a user. Log in as your user and configure your session so it starts KDE
when you issue <c>startx</c>. You can do this by writing <c>exec startkde</c> in
<path>~/.xinitrc</path> (see also
<uri link="/doc/en/xorg-config.xml#using_startx">Using startx</uri> in the
<uri link="/doc/en/xorg-config.xml">X Server Configuration Howto</uri>):
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring your local session">
$ <i>echo "exec startkde" &gt; ~/.xinitrc</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now start up your graphical environment by running <c>startx</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Starting KDE">
$ <i>startx</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted by an application called <c>KPersonalizer</c>.
Congratulations, let's now take a look at how we can configure KDE...
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Configuring KDE</title>
<section>
<title>KPersonalizer</title>
<body>

<p>
KPersonalizer is the application that configures KDE for you. It's a very
useful wizard that allows you to quickly change KDE to suit your own needs. When
you run KDE for the first time, KPersonalizer is automatically started.
</p>

<p>
The first input KPersonalizer requests is your country and the language of your
choice. As we haven't installed the necessary language packs on your system yet,
the available languages will be very slim -- you'll probably have only English
to choose from. Don't mind this, we will change the language later on (if
applicable of course).
</p>

<p>
The second choice you're offered is the <e>System Behavior</e>. This includes
window activation, mouse selection, etc. When you select a certain behavior
its description is shown to help you choose the behavior you like. If you're
uncertain, don't panic -- you are able to change the behavior whenever you
want.
</p>

<p>
Next, KPersonalizer asks for the amount of eye-candy it should activate. The
more eye-candy you want, the funkier your KDE will be, but the more your CPU
will be stressed. However, this should be taken with a bit of salt - on a 600
Mhz CPU with 128 Mb of memory, enabling full eye-candy still results in a
responsive system.
</p>

<p>
Finally, KDE asks what style you want to use. A style defines the window
decoration, theme, button layout, etc. Try several styles to see which one you
like the most. Did we already mention KDE is fully configurable?
</p>

<p>
Now sit back and enjoy -- KDE will start up and you'll be greeted by a nice,
clean, functional desktop environment.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Installing Language Packs</title>
<body>

<p>
If English isn't your native language or you're just interested in working with
KDE in a foreign language, please read on. We will install the language pack(s)
for the language(s) you want to use with KDE.
</p>

<p>
Language packs are contained in the <c>kde-i18n</c> package. To install the
language packs of your choice, you need to set the <c>LINGUAS</c> variable to
the language(s) you want to use. It is advisable to set this variable in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path> so that updating your system doesn't remove the
language packs you want.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting LINGUAS in /etc/make.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/make.conf</i>
<comment>(As an example, we install the language packs for Dutch (nl) 
 and French (fr))</comment>
LINGUAS="nl fr"
</pre>

<p>
Now run <c>emerge kde-i18n</c> to install the language packs. Once settled, fire
up KDE, then start the KDE Control Center (K-menu &gt; Control Center). This is
<e>the</e> application where you can control almost every aspect of KDE. It is
much more extended than KPersonalizer.
</p>

<p>
To change your language, go to <c>Regional &amp; Accessibility</c>,
<c>Country/Region &amp; Languages</c>. Then add the language(s) of your choice.
To see your (localized) KDE in its full glory, log out and in again, and enjoy.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Graphical Login</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to use <c>kdm</c> as graphical login manager (which means you don't
have to login to a terminal and type <c>startx</c> every time) you need
to edit a configuration file and set up your system so that it enters graphical
mode after boot, as explained below.
</p>

<p>
In <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>, set the <c>DISPLAYMANAGER</c> variable to
<c>kdm</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting DISPLAYMANAGER in /etc/rc.conf">
# <i>nano -w /etc/rc.conf</i>
<comment>(Edit the following variable)</comment>
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
</pre>

<p>
Finish up by adding <c>xdm</c> to the default runlevel:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding xdm to the default runlevel">
# <i>rc-update add xdm default</i>
</pre>

<p>
When you reboot your system, it will use KDM as the graphical login manager.
</p>

<p>
KDM will provide a list of available sessions to choose from, including KDE -
of course - and including all the other sessions installed on your system,
which KDM finds by looking in <path>/usr/share/xsessions/</path>. Thus, if you
use KDM, you don't need to edit <path>~/.xinitrc</path>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="kde_device_mounting">
<title>Setup KDE to Mount Devices</title>
<body>

<!-- TODO add pmount package when pmount is in arch.
     Also, add pmount to the default runlevel -->

<p>
KDE gives you the power to mount devices such as CDROMs or USB sticks through a
single click in a graphical interface. To accomplish this goal you need to have
KDE compiled with <c>hal</c> in your USE variable and to have <c>dbus</c> and
<c>hal</c> installed on your system. You should also add <c>dbus</c> and
<c>hal</c> to the default runlevel and add yourself to the <c>plugdev</c>
group.
</p>

<pre caption="Setup device mounting">
# <i>emerge --noreplace dbus hal</i>
# <i>rc-update add dbus default</i>
# <i>rc-update add hald default</i>
<comment>Add &lt;user&gt; to the plugdev group</comment>
# <i>gpasswd -a &lt;user&gt; plugdev</i>
</pre>

<chapter>
<title>Managing KDE Installations</title>
<section>
<title>Multiple Installations</title>
<body>

<p>
One peculiarity of the way KDE is managed in Gentoo is that when a new series
of KDE appears (such as the 3.5.x series, which supersedes the 3.4.x series)
it will be installed alongside the old one and will not overwrite it.  So if
for instance you had KDE 3.4 already installed and you emerge KDE 3.5,
you will have two versions, one installed in <path>/usr/kde/3.4/</path> and
the other in <path>/usr/kde/3.5/</path>.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that your settings for different KDE installations will be
kept separate in the home directory.  KDE 3.4 reads its settings from the
directory <path>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.kde3.4</path>, and the first time you run
KDE 3.5 a directory named <path>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.kde3.5</path> will be
created by migrating the settings in the 3.4 directory and will be then used to
store preferences and data.
</p>

<p>
Another important remark to keep in mind when upgrading your KDE installation
is that you could have problems with the external KDE applications you have
installed (such as <c>koffice</c>, <c>amarok</c> or <c>k3b</c>) until you
recompile them against the new KDE version.  So as soon as you start using the
new KDE you should reemerge them to make them link against the new libraries.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Unmerging Old Versions</title>
<body>

<p>
Having multiple versions of KDE installed poses the problem of how to remove
the old ones when we decide that they are not needed anymore.  Unfortunately
portage does not support unmerging a package with all its dependencies with a
single command, so if for instance you run <c>emerge --unmerge kde</c> you will
not remove the actual kde packages.
</p>

<p>
To remove a KDE installation (e.g. KDE 3.4), the single packages have to be
removed.
</p>

<pre caption="Removing KDE 3.4 packages">
# <i>emerge --unmerge =arts-3.4* =kdelibs-3.4* =kdebase-3.4* ...</i>
</pre>

<p>
Obviously this is very frustrating if you have many KDE packages installed.
However this operation can be automated in many ways.  The following one is
an example.
</p>

<p>
First we list all the packages that we want to remove. We use the <c>equery</c>
command for this, part of the <c>app-portage/gentoolkit</c> package:
</p>

<pre caption="Listing packages to remove">
<comment>(List all the installed KDE packages)</comment>
# <i>equery list kde-base/</i>
<comment>(List all the installed KDE packages and select the ones from KDE 3.4)</comment>
# <i>equery list kde-base/ | grep 3\.4</i>
</pre>

<p>
At this point you should double-check that the list corresponds to the packages
that should be removed from the system.  If you think it is ok, you can go on
and pass the list to the <c>emerge --unmerge</c> command.
</p>

<pre caption="Removing selected packages">
# <i>equery list kde-base/ | grep 3\.4 | xargs emerge --unmerge --pretend</i>
</pre>

<p>
Check again the output and reissue the command without <c>--pretend</c> to
start the unmerging process.
</p>

<p>
After the job has completed, the directory <path>/usr/kde/3.4/</path> should
contain only a few files (mainly configuration files, portage has a policy to
never touch configurations).  If you desire, you can safely wipe out
<path>/usr/kde/3.4/</path> with its content to remove what remains of KDE 3.4.

<p>
Make sure your <path>/etc/hosts</path> file is correct:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you have a static IP address, make sure your FQDN and hostname are
    mentioned on that line, like <c>192.168.0.10 tux.mydomain tux</c>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have a dynamic IP address or you do not have any additional
    interfaces at all, add your hostname after the localhost statement, like
    <c>127.0.0.1 localhost tux</c>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Check if you have DMA enabled for your disks:
