<title>Requirements</title>
<section>
<title>Minimum Bandwidth</title>
<body>
<p> To properly host a source mirror you should have a minimum of 2Mbps upstream bandwidth.  
ADSL and cable connections do not generally make adequate connections for distfile hosts due to their limited upstream performance.</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Minimum User Count</title>
<body>
<p>We ask that you support a minimum of 5 and preferrably 10 concurrent user connections.</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Update Frequency</title>
<body>
<p>We ask that source mirrors be updated at least 3-4 times throughout the day.  At a minimum, source mirrors should be updated once per day.</p>

<title>Implementation details</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>for new source mirror requests, the procedure will be as follows:</p>
<p>Someone asks to be a mirror, then we verify that the mirror exists and we can connect to it properly. Then, in the next 48-72 hours we will determine if your mirror is syncing correctly with <path>www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/</path> and accordingly with this policy.</p>

<p>If all steps went smoothly, we will then add you to our list of <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml">download mirrors</uri> on the main web site.</p> 

<p>Additionally, you, the mirror admin will be added to the gentoo-mirrors mailing list (low traffic) so that you can folllow all issues associated with source mirrors.
</p>

<title>Q) How do I find the mirror nearest to me?</title>
<body>
<p>A) mirrorselect was designed to do this for you. If you haven't already run <c>emerge mirrorselect</c> then do it.
Then run: <c>mirrorselect</c>. An ncurses-based menu will display allowing you to select a mirror close to you.
