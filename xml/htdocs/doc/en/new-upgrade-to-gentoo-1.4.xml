	<abstract>A method for upgrading older Gentoo installations in place to Gentoo 1.4</abstract>

	<chapter>
		<title>Before you begin</title>
		<section>
			<title>Be prepared</title>
			<body>
				<p>As with any major upgrade to the core of your Gentoo
				system, there is always the possibility that unforeseen
				problems will ensue.  It is always prudent to back up all
				important data before beginning this process.  If possible,
				try to allocate a large block of time for this upgrade, so
				that you will not feel rushed.  All the software on your
				machine will need to be recompiled.</p>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Other options</title>
			<body>
				<p>This is not the only way to upgrade your system.  You can
				install a new 1.4 system onto a separate partition and
				reuse some of your system configuration instead.  This method also has
				the advantage that you can always go back to your old system
				in the meantime as a fallback.  You may also decide to simply 
				not upgrade your system.  If you decide you want to upgrade
				in place, read on.</p>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>General notes</title>
			<body>
				<p>Whenever the code listings suggest running the
				<c>emerge</c> command, it is always a good idea to make a test
				run of the command using the <c>-p</c> or <c>--pretend</c>
				option to make sure that the command will do what you expect
				it to do.</p>

		<title>Upgrading in place</title>
		<section>
			<title>Get Portage as current as possible</title>
			<body>
				<p>Some of the syntax of current ebuilds is unreadable by
				older versions of Portage. If you don't have at least Portage 2.0.44, try upgrading Portage.</p>
				<pre>
# <i>emerge sync</i>
# <i>emerge -u portage</i>
</pre>
				<note>If your Portage version is very old, you may get an
				error message containing the phrase "unscriptable object".
				Read and follow the instructions in
				<path>/usr/portage/sys-apps/portage/files/README.RESCUE</path>.
				Your Portage install should then be
				current.</note>
</body></section>

		<section>
			<title>Preparing GCC for cohabitation</title>
			<body>
				<p>You will be installing a newer version of GCC during this
				upgrade.  Versions of GCC older than 2.95.3-r8 are not
				designed to have multiple versions of GCC installed.  You must
				therefore upgrade GCC to at least version 2.95.3-r8.  This
				will also have the beneficial side-effect of installing the
				<c>gcc-config</c> package on your system, which can be used to
				switch back and forth between various installed versions of
				GCC.</p>

				<pre>
# <i>emerge -u gcc</i>
</pre>

				<p>You can now check to see if gcc-config is working properly:</p>
				<pre>
# <c>gcc-config --get-current-profile</c>
</pre>
				<p>This should return i686-pc-linux-gnu-2.95.3 on most x86 systems. Older systems may return i586-pc-linux-gnu-2.95.3.</p>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Installing GCC 3</title>
			<body>
				<p>Now you can install a newer version of GCC without damaging
				your current compiler.  Look in
				<path>/usr/portage/sys-devel/gcc</path> for a version of the
				GCC ebuild that is at least 3.2.1-r6.  Choose the highest
				version that is marked stable for your architecture.  To see
				if an ebuild is considered stable for your architecture, look
				for the KEYWORDS line in the ebuild file.  If it has your
				architecture listed without a ~ in front of it, it is
				considered stable.  Assuming 3.2.2 is the most current stable
				version, then issue the following command:</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge /usr/portage/sys-devel/gcc/gcc-3.2.2.ebuild</i>
</pre>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Changing profiles</title>
			<body>
				<p>Now you need to change two sets of profiles: your
				gcc-config profile and your Portage profile.</p>
				<pre>
# <i>cd /etc</i>
# <i>rm make.profile</i>
# <i>ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/default-x86-1.4 make.profile</i> <codenote>Replace "x86" with your architecture</codenote>
</pre>

				<pre>
# <i>gcc-config --list-profiles</i> <codenote>Note the one for the version you just emerged, use it below</codenote>
# <i>gcc-config i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.2.2</i> <codenote>Replace with the version you noted above</codenote>
</pre>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Recompile toolchain</title>
			<body>
				<p>Now you need to recompile your core toolchain with your new
				compiler.  If you are continuing in the same shell, you need
				to run <c>source /etc/profile</c> as gcc-config instructed you
				to.  Then emerge glibc and binutils using your new
				compiler:</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge glibc binutils</i>
</pre>
				<warn>It is quite likely that you will upgrade glibc from a
				2.2 or older version to 2.3.  Do not downgrade glibc
				afterwards.  Any software you have compiled against glibc 2.3
				will stop working, and this can make your system
				unusable.</warn>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Recompiling everything with your new compiler</title>
			<body><p>Now you may recompile everything on your system with
			your new compiler:</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge -e world</i>
</pre>
				<note>If this command fails at any point due to errors, you
				can use <c>emerge --resume</c> to continue the process where
				you left off.  This requires Portage 2.0.47 or later.</note>
