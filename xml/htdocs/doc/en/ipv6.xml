<title>Kernel Setup</title>

<section>
<title>Basic Kernel Configuration</title>
<body>
<p>
Any of the 2.4 kerneltrees available in Gentoo will easily support IPv6 
connections. Additionally, both <c>sys-kernel/gentoo-sources</c> and 
<c>sys-kernel/pfeifer-sources</c> optionally have the USAGI patches 
applied. The USAGI patchset is not required, but it is in active 
development and implements many elements of IPv6 not present in the 
kernel otherwise. To use the USAGI patchset, make sure you have 'usagi' 
in your USE variables when emerging either of 
these sources. The 2.5.x development kernel also has excellent IPv6 
support, having incorporated much of the USAGI code.
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging a kernel">
# <i>USE="usagi" emerge gentoo-sources</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>USE="usagi" emerge pfeifer-sources</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we are ready to enter the kernel source directory and begin our 
actual kernel configuration.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring the Linux Kernel">
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>

<note>
This assumes the symlink <path>/usr/src/linux</path> points to the 
sources you will be using.
</note>

<note>
Make sure you have <path>Prompt for development and/or incomplete 
code/drivers</path> enabled in your kernel config.
</note>

<p>
After enabling the recommended options, recompile your kernel and reboot 
into your new IPv6-enabled kernel. If IPv6 is working, the loopback 
device should show an IPv6 address.
</p>

<pre caption = "Checking the loopback device">

</pre>
<p>Before going any further, make sure that you add "ipv6" to your list of USE 
variables in make.conf, so that future emerges of packages will include 
IPv6 support.</p>

<title>Tunnel Configuration</title>

<section>
<title>Basic Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Most ISPs still do not offer any native IPv6 connections. To get around 
this limitation, there are several "tunnel brokers" around the globe 
that offer free IPv6 tunnels. This will allow you to tunnel all your 
IPv6 connections through an IPv4 connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Broker</th><th>Location</th></tr>
<tr><ti><uri link="http://tunnelbroker.net">Hurricane Electric</uri></ti><ti>US/Canada</ti></tr>
<tr><ti><uri link="http://www.freenet6.net">Freenet6</uri></ti><ti>US</ti></tr>
<tr><ti><uri link="http://ipng.org.uk">IPnG</uri></ti><ti>UK</ti></tr>
<tr><ti><uri link="http://tb.ipv6.btexact.com">BTExact</uri></ti><ti>Europe</ti></tr>
</table>

<p>
Below are two examples for setting up a tunnel with two popular North 
American tunnels, Hurricane Electric and Freenet6.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Hurricane Electric</title>
<body>

<p>
Hurricane Electric (HE for short) offers free IPv6 tunnels and allocates
a /64 block of addresses for you. It also allows configuration of 
reverse DNS. Getting a tunnel from HE is as easy as going to 
<uri>http://www.tunnelbroker.net</uri> and filling out a one page form.
</p>

<note>
Registration includes listing information like your address and phone 
number.
</note>

<warn>
Tunnels from HE take 24 hours to be activated.  This is in order to curb
abuse of the service.
</warn>

<p>
After you have a tunnel approved and have a /64 block allocated, you can
configure your Gentoo box. HE provides sample configurations based on 
ifconfig and the iproute utilities. The following two examples assume 
you have the following configuration:
</p>

<table>
<tr><ti>Local IPv4 Address</ti><ti>68.36.91.195</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>HE IPv4 Address</ti><ti>64.71.128.82</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>Local IPv6 tunnel Address</ti><ti>2001:470:1F00:FFFF::189</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>IPv6 Block</ti><ti>2001:470:1F00:296::/64</ti></tr>
</table>

<p>
Using the net-tools and <c>ifconfig</c>, you would do the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Configuration with ifconfig">
# <i>ifconfig sit0 up</i>
# <i>ifconfig sit0 inet6 tunnel ::64.71.128.82 </i>
<codenote>Add a tunnel to the HE IPv4 address</codenote>
# <i>ifconfig sit1 up</i>
# <i>ifconfig sit1 inet6 add 2001:470:1F00:FFFF::189/127</i>
# <i>route -A inet6 add ::/0 dev sit1</i>
<codenote>Route all IPv6 traffic through the 'sit1' device</codenote>
</pre>

<p>
Using the iproute package and the <c>ip</c> command, you would do the 
following:
</p>

<pre caption="Configuration with ip">
# <i>ip tunnel add sixbone mode sit remote 64.71.128.82 local 68.36.91.195 ttl 255</i>
<codenote>Create a tunnel between the local IPv4 and HE's remote IPv4 address</codenote>
# <i>ip link set sixbone up</i>
# <i>ip addr add 2001:470:1F00:FFFF::189/127 dev sixbone</i>
<codenote>Bring the tunnel up, and assign the IPv6 address to it</codenote>
# <i>ip route add ::/0 dev sixbone</i>
<codenote>Route all IPv6 address through our 'sixbone' tunnel device</codenote>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Freenet6</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="www.freenet6.net">Freenet6</uri> is another free tunnel 
broker. Registration only requires a username and a valid email address.
They have chosen to turn the tunnel management into a client/server 
setup and have created the <c>tspc</c> client. The client is available 
in portage but still masked pending more testing. To install it do:
</p>

<pre>
# <i>USE="~x86" emerge freenet6</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now you need to configure freenet6 by editing 
<path>/etc/freenet6/tspc.conf</path>. You should only have to edit the
<path>userid</path> and <path>passwd</path> fields to match those 
assigned from Freenet6. Below is a complete sample config file.
</p>

<pre caption="tspc.conf example">
tsp_version=1.0.1
tsp_dir=/etc/freenet6
auth_method=any
client_v4=auto
<i>userid=anonymous</i>
<i>passwd=foobar</i>
template=gentoo
server=tsps1.freenet6.net
retry_delay=0
if_tunnel=sit3
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Testing your connection</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your tunnel is configured, you can test your connection. The 
easiest way to do this is to use the <c>ping6</c> utility and try to ping 
an IPv6 host.
</p>

<pre caption = "Testing the connection">
# <i>emerge iputils</i>
# <i>ping6 www.kame.net</i>

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 277.040/281.041/290.046/4.699 ms
</pre>

<p>
Further work is currently in progress to add better IPv6 support to the 
network init scripts. If you'd like to know the status of this and/or

<title>IPv6 Support in Applications</title>

<section>
<title>Re-emerging packages</title>
<body>

<p>
Unless you had USE="ipv6" in your <path>/etc/make.conf</path> previously,
you probably need to re-emerge a bunch of packages to compile in IPv6 
support for them. To get a list of all the installed packages which 
leverage the 'ipv6' USE variable, you can run the below line.
</p>

<pre caption="Candidates for re-emerging">
# <i>emerge -epv world | grep ipv6 | sed "s:^.*\] ::; s:-[0-9]\+.*::" | cut -d' ' -f1</i>
</pre>

<p>
To easily re-emerge some selected packages, do:
</p>

<pre caption="Candidates for re-emerging">
# <i>emerge -epv world | grep ipv6 | sed "s:^.*\] ::; s:-[0-9]\+.*::" | \</i>
&gt; <i>cut -d' ' -f1 > packages</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, edit the <path>packages</path> file to remove any packages you 
don't want to recompile at this time. Then simply run:
</p>

<pre>
# <i>emerge `cat packages`</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>IPv6 Specific Packages</title>
<body>

<p>
There are a few packages which specifically deal with IPv6 items. Most 
of these are located in <path>/usr/portage/net-misc</path>.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><ti>net-misc/ipv6calc</ti><ti>Converts an IPv6 address to a compressed format</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>net-misc/nc6</ti><ti>netcat version that supports IPv6 and IPv4</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>dev-perl/Socket6</ti><ti>IPv6 related part of the C socket.h defines and structure manipulators</ti></tr>

<title>DNS setup</title>

<section>
<title>IPv6 and DNS</title>
<body>

<p>
Just as DNS for IPv4 uses A records, DNS for IPv6 uses AAAA records. 
(This is because IPv4 is an address space of 2^32 while IPv6 is an 
address space of 2^128). For reverse DNS, the INT standard is the most 
supported. ARPA is the latest format but is not in as much widespread 
use as INT. Support for the INT format will be described here.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>BIND configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Recent versions of BIND include excellent IPv6 support. This section 
will assume you have at least minimal knowledge about the configuration
and use of BIND. We will assume you are not running bind in a chroot. 
If you are, simply append the chroot prefix to most of the paths in the
following section.
</p>

<p>
First you need to add entries for both forward and reverse DNS zone files
in <path>/etc/bind/named.conf</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="named.conf entries">
zone "ipv6-rules.com" IN {
	type master;
	file "pri/ipv6-rules.com";
};
<codenote>This will provide the forward DNS for the domain 'ipv6-rules.com'</codenote>
zone "6.9.2.0.0.0.f.1.0.7.4.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.int" {
	type master;
	file "pri/rev-ipv6-rules.com.int";
};
<codenote>This format for reverse DNS is "bitwise." It's done by taking the IPv6 prefix,</codenote>
<codenote>reversing the order of the numbers and putting a period between each number</codenote>
</pre>

<p>
Now we must create those zone files and add entries for all of our 
hosts:
</p>

<pre caption="pri/ipv6-rules.com">
$TTL    2h
@       IN      SOA     ipv6-rules.com. webmaster.ipv6-rules.com.  (
                                2003052501 ; Serial

				14400      ; Retry
				3600000    ; Expire
				86400 )    ; Minimum

host2	IN	AAAA	2001:470:1f00:296::3:3 ; address for host2.ipv6-rules.com
</pre>

<pre caption="pri/rev-ipv6-rules.com.int">

<title>DJBDNS configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
There are currently some third-party patches to DJBDNS available at 
<uri link="http://www.fefe.de/dns/">http://www.fefe.de/dns/</uri> that allow 
it to do IPv6 nameserving. DJBDNS can be installed with these patches 
by emerging it with "ipv6" in your USE variables.
</p>

<warn>
Not all record types are support yet with these patches.  In particular, 
NS and MX records are not supported.
</warn>

<pre>
# <i>USE="ipv6" emerge djbdns</i>
</pre>

<p>
After djbdns is installed, it can be setup by running 
<c>tinydns-setup</c> and answering a few questions about which IP 
addresses to bind to, where to install tinydns, etc.
</p>

<pre caption = "Setting up tinydns">
# <i>tinydns-setup</i>
</pre>

<p>
Assuming we've installed <c>tinydns</c> into <path>/var/tinydns</path>, 
we can now edit <path>/var/tinydns/root/data</path>. This file will contain
all the data needed to get tinydns handling DNS for your IPv6 delegation.
</p>

<pre caption="sample data file">
.ipv6-rules.com:192.168.0.1:a:259200
<codenote>*.ipv6-rules.com is authoritatively handled by 192.168.0.1</codenote>
.6.9.2.0.0.0.f.1.0.7.4.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.int:192.168.0.1:a
<codenote>Authoritative reverse DNS for 2001:470:1f00:296::/64</codenote>

6host2.ipv6-rules.com:200104701f0002960000000000000002:86400
<codenote>Specify the IPs for host1 and host2</codenote>
3www.ipv6-rules.com:200104701f0002960000000000000002:86400
<codenote>Point www to host1</codenote>
</pre>

<p>
Lines prefixed with a <c>6</c> will have both an AAAA and a PTR record 
created. Those prefixed with a <c>3</c> will only have an AAAA record 
created. Besides manually editing the <path>data</path> file, you can 
use the scripts <c>add-host6</c> and <c>add-alias6</c> to add new entries.
After changes are made to the <path>data</path> file, you simply need to 
run <c>make</c> from <path>/var/tinydns/root</path>. This will create 
<path>/var/tinydns/root/data.cfb</path>, which tinydns will use as its 
source of information for DNS requests.

<title>IPv6 Router</title>

<section>
<title>Configure routing</title>
<body>

<p>
Further configuration is required if we want to use our system as a 
router for other clients wishing to connect to the outside world with 
IPv6. We need to enable forwarding of IPv6 packets. We can do this in 
one of two ways.
</p>

<pre caption="Enabling forwarding">
# <i>echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding</i>
or
# <i>sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding</i>
</pre>

<warn>
The radvd init script enables forwarding, making the next step 
unnecessary.
</warn>

<p>
To enable forwarding at boot, you'll need to edit 
<path>/etc/sysctl.conf</path> and add the following line.
</p>

<pre caption="sysctl.conf addition">
net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1
</pre>

<p>
Traffic should now be forwarded from this box through the tunnel we've 
established with our broker.
</p>

<p>
To assign IPv6 addresses to clients, the IPv6 specification allows for 
both stateless and stateful IP assignment. Stateless assignment uses a 
process called Router Advertisement and allows clients to obtain an IP 
and a default route by simply bringing an interface up. It is called 
"stateless" because there is no record of IPs assigned and the host they 
are assigned to. Stateful assignment is handled by DHCPv6. It is 
"stateful" because the server keeps a state of the clients who've 
requested IPs and received them.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Stateless Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Stateless configuration is easily accomplished using the Router 
Advertisement Daemon, or radvd.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring radvd">
# <i>emerge radvd</i>
</pre>

<p>
After having emerged radvd, we need to create 
<path>/etc/radvd/radvd.conf</path> that contains information about what
IP block to assign IPs from. Here is a sample <path>radvd.conf</path> 
file using the prefix we've been assigned from our tunnel broker.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample radvd.conf">
interface eth0
{
        AdvSendAdvert on;
	<codenote>Send advertisement messages to other hosts</codenote>
	AdvLinkMTU 1280;
	MaxRtrAdvInterval 300;
	prefix 2001:470:1F00:296::/64
	<codenote>The group of IPs we have at our disposal</codenote>
	{
		AdvOnLink on;
		AdvAutonomous on;
	};
};
</pre>

<p>
Further information is available in <c>man radvd.conf</c>. We can now 
start radvd and set it to start at boot.
</p>

<pre caption = "Starting up radvd">
# <i>/etc/init.d/radvd start</i>
# <i>rc-update add radvd default</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Stateful Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
If you'd like to use stateful configuration, you'll need to install and 
configure dhcpv6.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing dhcpv6">
# <i>emerge dhcpv6</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next we must configure the DHCPv6 server by editing 
<path>/etc/dhcp6s.conf</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample dhcp6s.conf">
prefer-life-time 10000;
valid-life-time 20000;
renew-time 5000;
rebind-time 8000;
interface eth1 {
	link AAA {
		allow unicast;
		send unicast;
		allow rapid-commit;
		send server-preference 5;
		renew-time 1000;
		rebind-time 2400;
		prefer-life-time 2000;
		valid-life-time 3000;
                pool{
                        range 2001:470:1f00:296::10 to 2001:470:1f00:296::110/64;
                        prefix 2001:470:1f00:296::/64;
                };
	};
};
</pre>

<p>
We can now start dhcp6s, and configure it to start at boot.
</p>

<pre caption = "Starting dhcp6s">
# <i>/etc/init.d/dhcp6s start</i>
# <i>rc-update add dhcp6s default</i>

<title>IPv6 Clients</title>
<section>
<title>Using radvd</title>
<body>

<p>
Clients behind this router should now be able to connect to the rest 
of the net via IPv6. If using radvd, configuring hosts should be as easy
as bringing the interface up. (This is probably already done by your 
net.ethX init scripts).

<title>using DHCPv6</title>
<body>

<p>
If your router is set up to use DHCPv6, your clients will also need to 
have the dhcpv6 package installed. After having done this, you need to 
configure your client by editing <path>/etc/dhcp6c.conf</path>.
</p>

<title>Using 6to4 Conversion</title>
<section>
<title>Basic principles</title>
<body>

<p>
6to4 conversion can be used if you want to have hosts that talk to IPv4
hosts over a purely IPv6 connection. Thus you can have an entirely IPv6
internal network, with one host dealing with connecting to the outside 
IPv4/IPv6 world.

<title>DNS configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
To get 6to4 conversion working, a DNS proxy , <c>totd</c>, need to be 
configured that will send you AAAA records for sites that really only have 
A records. These AAAA records will point to IPv6 addresses which don't 
actually exist, but which will get routed through a 6to4 proxy. 
<c>totd</c> is still <c>~x86</c> masked pending further testing.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing totd">
# <i>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge totd</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, we need to setup <path>/etc/totd.conf</path> with some basic 
configuration information.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample /etc/totd.conf">
forwarder 192.168.0.2 port 53
<codenote>Points to a real DNS nameserver</codenote>
prefix 3ffe:abcd:1234:9876::
<codenote>What prefix to put before faked AAAA records</codenote>
port 5005
<codenote>What port to run totd on</codenote>
pidfile /var/run/totd.pid
<codenote>What PID file to use</codenote>
stf
<codenote>Actually do 6to4 stuff</codenote>
</pre>

<note>
<c>totd</c> must be set to use a port different than port 53 if another 
nameserver is running on the same machine.
</note>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>6to4 proxy</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>ptrtd</c> will be used as a 6to4 proxy, enabling connections between 
the internal IPv6 host and the outside IPv4 host.
</p>

<pre caption = "Installing ptrtd">
# <i>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge ptrtd</i>
</pre>

<p>
We now need to configure <c>ptrtd</c>, telling it what fake prefix 
(the one we setup <c>totd</c> to use) to create proxy connections for. 
Edit <path>/etc/conf.d/ptrtd</path> and set <c>IPV6_PREFIX</c>. This 
should be the same prefix as was configured with <c>totd</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample /etc/ptrtd.conf">
IPV6_PREFIX="3ffe:abcd:1234:9876::"
</pre>

<p>
You can now start totd, and enable it to start at boot.
</p>

<pre caption = "Starting totd">
# <i>/etc/init.d/totd start</i>
# <i>rc-update add totd default</i>
</pre>

<section>
<title>Client configuration and testing</title>
<body>

<p>
Clients may now be configured to connect to both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts 
through an IPv6 only connection. Assuming that the clients are already 
receiving an IP address from radvd, we simply need to add a new DNS 
resolver entry, and add a default route for those "fake addresses". 
First, add an entry at the top of your <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path> 
pointing to the machine running <c>totd</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/resolv.conf sample">
nameserver 2001:470:1f00:296::1
<codenote>The server running totd</codenote>
</pre>

<p>
To test name resolution, request an AAAA record for a known IPv4 
only site.
</p>

<pre caption = "Testing name resolution">
# <i>host -t aaaa google.com</i>
google.com has AAAA address 3ffe:abcd:1234:9876::d8ef:3364
google.com has AAAA address 3ffe:abcd:1234:9876::d8ef:3564
</pre>

<p>
We will now add a default route for all addresses prefixed with our 
chosen fake prefix.
</p>

<pre caption="Using the route utility">
# <i>route -A inet6 add 3ffe:abcd:1234:9876::/64 gw 2001:470:1f00:296::1</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Using iproute">
# <i>ip route add 3ffe:abcd:1234:9876::/64 via 2001:470:1f00:296::1 dev eth0</i>
</pre>

<p>
Finally, use <c>ping6</c> to ping google.com at it's fake IPv6 
location.
</p>

<pre caption="Testing 6to4">
# <i>ping6 -c 2 google.com</i>
