<title>What is hardware 3D acceleration and why do I want it?</title>
<body>

<p>
With hardware 3D acceleration, three-dimensional rendering uses the graphics 
processor on your video card instead of taking up valuable CPU resources 
drawing 3D images. It's also referred to as "hardware acceleration" instead of 
"software acceleration" because without this 3D acceleration your CPU is forced
to draw everything itself using the Mesa software rendering libraries, which 
takes up quite a bit of processing power. While Xorg typically supports 2D
hardware acceleration, it often lacks hardware 3D acceleration. 
Three-dimensional hardware acceleration is valuable in situations requiring 
rendering of 3D objects such as games, 3D CAD and modeling.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>How do I get hardware 3D acceleration?</title>
<body>

<p>
In many cases, both binary and open-source drivers exist. Open-source drivers 
are preferable since we're using Linux and open source is one of its underlying
principles. Sometimes, binary drivers are the only option, like with nVidia's 
cards. Binary drivers include media-video/nvidia-kernel and 
media-video/nvidia-glx for nVidia cards, media-video/mgavideo for Matrox cards 
and media-video/ati-drivers for ATI cards. Other open-source drivers include 
media-video/kyro-kernel for KyroII cards and media-video/ati-gatos for ATI 
cards, which aim to support ATI's video capabilities more fully.

<title>What is DRI?</title>
<body>

<p>
The Direct Rendering Infrastructure (<uri 
link="http://dri.sourceforge.net">dri.sourceforge.net</uri>), also known as the 
DRI, is a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware in a safe 
and efficient manner. It includes changes to the X server, to several client 
libraries and to the kernel. The first major use for the DRI is to create fast 
OpenGL implementations.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>What is X11-DRM and how does it relate to regular Xorg?</title>
<body>

<p>
X11-DRM is an <e>enhancement</e> to Xorg that adds 3D acceleration for 
cards by adding the kernel module necessary for direct rendering.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Purpose</title>
<body>

<p>
This guide is for people who can't get direct rendering working with just 
Xorg. X11-DRM works for 3dfx, gamma, i8x0, matrox, rage128, radeon, mach64 
and sis300 series drivers. See the <uri 
link="http://dri.sourceforge.net">DRI homepage</uri> for more info and 
documentation.

<title>Configure your kernel</title>

<p>
Probe for your chipset and enable just that one.

# <i>emerge pciutils; lspci | grep AGP</i>

<comment>(Your output may not match the above due to different hardware.)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
If your chipset is not supported by the kernel you might have some succes by
passing <c>agp=try_unsupported</c> as a kernel parameter. This will use Intel's
generic routines for AGP support. To add this parameter, edit your bootloader
configuration file!
</p>

<p>
Most, if not all, kernels should have these options. This was configured using 
gentoo-sources-2.4.20-r5.

<p>
If you use a 2.4 kernel, make sure the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) is 
<e>off</e>. The X11-DRM package will provide its own. 2.6 kernel users should
<e>enable</e> the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) as the X11-DRM package
currently does not support 2.6 kernels yet.

<p>
If you want your kernel to be named something other than bzImage, be sure to 
copy to /boot/yourname instead. Don't forget to set up grub.conf or lilo.conf 
and run /sbin/lilo if you use LILO.

<title>Using the CVS sources</title>
<section>
<body>

<warn>
Don't do this if the package worked.
</warn>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Do you need the CVS?</title>
<body>

<p>
First you have to check whether the x11-drm package works. If it doesn't and 
you have checked your logs to verify it's not a configuration error, you might 
want to consider the CVS sources. There are also daily driver snapshots 
available if you do not wish to build the full CVS.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Do the CVS sources support your card?</title>
<body>

<p>
Check the DRI <uri
link="http://dri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Status">supported cards
list</uri> to see if the CVS supports your card. Even if it doesn't, but it
supports a similar card, try it.
</p>

<!-- I see a couple of 8x AGP stuff on the Internet about vanilla 2.4 kernels;
     is this now available or not? I've commented it out for the time being,
     hoping that this doesn't affect us :)

<warn>
"Linux 2.4 doesn't support agp 8x, so I had to go find a backport. The backport 
works .... it doesn't patch quite properly, and it requires 2.4.21 (I've only 
gotten it to work with vanilla, straight from the tarball (not ebuild)). First 
go get the 2.4.20-2.4.21 patch from kernel.org .... (then get the patch,) It 
was on a mailing list somewhere. It doesn't patch cleanly - - one file fails, 
the pci_ids.h file, but if you actually read the file and the reject list, it's
very easy to fix. But it does load, and it gives me 1600x1200 with video 
(although a bit slow b/c of lack of dga) with xfree-drm." (SanityInAnarchy on 
#gentoo)
</warn>

<impo>
The patch is a little tricky to work with but <uri 
link="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0302.2/att-1618/01-agp3.diff.bz2">here's 
the link</uri>. If you can disable 8X AGP in your BIOS, change it to 4X and you 
may not need the patch.

<title>Follow the CVS Instructions</title>
<body>

<p>
The DRI project has a document about CVS compiling themselves. Please read <uri
link="http://dri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Building">the document</uri>
and follow the instructions up to the <e>Installing for XFree86</e> or
<e>Installing for X.org</e> part.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Install the CVS</title>
<body>

<p>
Verify that the DRI kernel module(s) for your system were built:
</p>

<pre caption="Verification">
# <i>cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel; ls</i>
</pre>

<p>
For the 3dfx Voodoo, you should see <path>tdfx.o</path>. For the Matrox 
G200/G400, you should see <path>mga.o</path>. For the ATI Rage 128, you should 
see <path>r128.o</path>. For the ATI Radeon, you should see 
<path>radeon.o</path>. For the Intel i810, you should see <path>i810.o</path>. 
If the DRI kernel module(s) failed to build, you should verify that you're 
using the right version of the Linux kernel. The most recent kernels are not 
always supported.
</p>

<p>
Install over your XFree86 or X.org installation. You may wish to back up xfree
or xorg-x11.
</p>

<pre caption="Backing up Xorg">
# <i>quickpkg xorg-x11</i>
<comment>(This backs up your Xorg-X11 package.)</comment>
# <i>make install</i>
</pre>

<p>
Follow the "Configure Xorg" section above.
</p>

<p>
To load the appropriate DRM module in your running kernel, copy the kernel 
module to <path>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/drm/</path> then 
run <c>modules-update</c> and restart your X server. If you're not running the 
kernel you'll be using it in, instead of <c>`uname -r`,</c> use that kernel's 
name.
</p>

<warn>
Make sure you first unload any older DRI kernel modules that might be already 
loaded. Note that some DRM modules require that the agpgart module be loaded 
first.

<title>Troubleshooting</title>
<section>
<title>It doesn't work. I just recompiled my kernel or switched to a new one.</title>
<body>

<p>
Whenever you rebuild your kernel or switch to another kernel, you'll have to 
rebuild the kernel module.  Note that you don't need to remerge xfree or
xorg-x11, but you will need to remerge x11-drm.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>It doesn't work. I don't have rendering, and I can't tell why.</title>
<body>

<p>
Try <c>insmod radeon</c> before you start the X server. Also, try building 
agpgart into the kernel instead of as a module.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>When I startx, I get this error: "[drm] failed to load kernel module agpgart"</title>
<body>

<p>
That's because you compiled agpgart into the kernel instead of as a module. 
Ignore it unless you're having problems.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Direct rendering doesn't work, and in /var/log/Xorg.0.log I have an error about driver version too low.</title>
<body>

<p>
You aren't using the x11-drm driver. Check if you compiled DRM and the driver 
into the kernel; you shouldn't have.

Try out the binary drivers. For ati-drivers, a listing is at

don't support it, use fbdev. It's slow, but it works.
