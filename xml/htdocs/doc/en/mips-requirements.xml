<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Not many sites give you a quick overview on the supported MIPS hardware. To be
able to give you an idea on how the MIPS support is progressing we will list as
much hardware-information as possible. If you still have questions, don't
hesitate to ask <mail link="kumba@gentoo.org">Joshua Kinard</mail>.
</p>

<p>
In the support-list, we use "[...]" with <c>blue</c> color to denote
experimental support. Unsupported items are embraced by "(...)" and colored in
<brite>red</brite>.

<note>
(1): If you lack an appropriate Framebuffer, you will be required to use serial
console. Serial console programs for linux include minicom and xc, and for
Windows, HyperTerminal and Tera Term Pro. If you are running Windows, and intend
to use HyperTerminal, it is advised that you seek out an updated client from the
program's website instead of the one installed by default. An upgraded client
provides much better serial support than the default one installed by Windows.
</note>

<note>
(2): The Challenge S has its RJ-45 connector on a daughter board linked with an
unsupported SCSI adapter, a WD33C95A. In order for this network connector to
function, this SCSI bus needs to be activated, however it is not yet supported
by Linux. As a result of this, the Challenge S can only get network connectivity
via its AUI connector.

<note>
(3): Indigo2 EISA Support is <e>highly</e> experimental. It isn't very well 
tested and may not work with all hardware. Hardware that it is known to function
with is listed, and as more compatible hardware is discovered, it will be added.
Please note that hardware requiring DMA support is currently not functional. 
This includes EISA/ISA-based soundcards. EISA Video cards requiring an 
x86-compatible BIOS are also not functional.
</note>

<p>
The maximum amount of RAM supported in the Indigo/Indy systems is 256MB, due to
no HIGHMEM support in 32-bit kernels. Only a 64-bit kernel can properly detect
RAM amounts greater than 256MB on these systems.
</p>

<p>
MIPS Little-Endian (mipsel) is currently being tested on a Cobalt RaQ2, however
progress is currently hindered by a flaky Tulip NIC driver in the 2.4.21 mips
kernels that makes running Gentoo a bit difficult. Any help in this effort is
appreciated.
</p>

<p>
The Playstation 2 is a specialized MIPS system, using an R5900 MIPS processor.
The support for this processor is extremely limited, and only found in the
development toolchains available in the PS2 Linux Kit and via some patches
available on the PS2 Linux Homepage. There was a limited amount of work done on
porting Gentoo to the PS2 Linux Kit, however it is incomplete as of this
writing. Those interested may visit
<uri>http://playstation2-linux.com/projects/gentoo-ps2/</uri> if they are 
interested in assisting or completing the port. Additional information on PS2
Compiler Toolchains can be found at <uri>http://ps2dev.sf.net/</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo/MIPS has also been installed on a SiByte BCM1250 Machine, a Big-endian,
dual-processor MIPS machine. Currently, only one person to date has done this,
but more people willing to test Gentoo on such hardware are welcomed to try and
report results.

<title>Minimum Requirements</title>
<section>
<body>

<ul>
  <li>
    128MB RAM - More ram is better, as Gentoo currently uses the gcc-3.2.x and
    greater versions of gcc. These versions of gcc tend to consume more memory
    than their older 2.95.x counterparts, and on the merging of large packages,
    anything less than 128MB of ram could make gcc fail to compile the package,
    or mysteriously stop in the middle of compiliation. A recommended amount of
    ram is 160MB.
  </li>
  <li>
    9GB Hard Drive Space - 9GB is more or less the recommended minimum. It is
    enough space to install Gentoo on and leaves extra space for daily
    activities on the machine. Gentoo has been installed on smaller drives, the
    smallest being a 3.2GB drive, but it does not leave alot of room for much
    else.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Although unusual in a "requirements" document, we just don't want to hide this
from you :-) Discussed in more detail below are the MIPS ISA Levels, which
enable or disable certain features in the processor, depending on what ISA level
the processor conforms to.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    MIPS1 (<c>-march=mips1</c>) enables instructions from level 1 of the MIPS 
    ISA. This is the default.  r3000 is the default cpu-type at this ISA level.
  </li>
  <li>
    MIPS2 (<c>-march=mips2</c>) enables instructions from level 2 of the MIPS 
    ISA (branch likely, square root instructions).  r6000 is the default 
    cpu-type at this ISA level.
  </li>
  <li>
    MIPS3 (<c>-march=mips3</c>) enables instructions from level 3 of the MIPS 
    ISA (64-bit instructions).  r4000 is the default cpu-type at this ISA 
    level.
  </li>
  <li>
    MIPS4 (<c>-march=mips4</c>) enables instructions from level 4 of the MIPS 
    ISA (conditional move, prefetch, enhanced FPU instructions). r8000 is the 
    default cpu-type at this ISA level.
  </li>
</ul>
