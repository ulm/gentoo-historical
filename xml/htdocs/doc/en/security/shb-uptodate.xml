<title>Keeping up-to-date</title>
<body>

<p>
Once you have successfully installed your system and ensured a good level of
security you are not done. Security is an ongoing process; the vast majority of
intrusions result from known vulnerabilities in unpatched systems. Keeping your
system up-to-date is the single most valuable step you can take to greater
security.
</p>

<p>
If you have a recent version of <c>portage</c> installed, you can first sync
your portage tree with <c>emerge --sync</c> and then issue the command
<c>glsa-check --list</c> to check if your system is up to date security-wise.
<c>glsa-check</c> is part of <c>app-portage/gentoolkit</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Example output of glsa-check -l">
# <i>glsa-check -l</i>
WARNING: This tool is completely new and not very tested, so it should not be
used on production systems. It's mainly a test tool for the new GLSA release
and distribution system, it's functionality will later be merged into emerge
and equery.
Please read http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/glsa-integration.xml
before using this tool AND before reporting a bug.

[A] means this GLSA was already applied,
[U] means the system is not affected and
[N] indicates that the system might be affected.

200406-03 [N] sitecopy: Multiple vulnerabilities in included libneon ( net-misc/sitecopy )
200406-04 [U] Mailman: Member password disclosure vulnerability ( net-mail/mailman )
.......
</pre>

<warn>
The <c>glsa-check</c> is still experimental, so if security really is your top
priority it would be wise to double check the list with other sources.
</warn>

<p>
All lines with a <c>[A]</c> and <c>[U]</c> can be almost safely ignored as the
system is not affected by this GLSA.
</p>

<p>
Some people still prefer to use <c>emerge packagename</c> instead of
<c>glsa-check -f</c> so all GLSAs are listed as <c>[N]</c>.
</p>

<p>
If you want an email each time a GLSA is released subscribe to the 
<c>gentoo-announce</c> mailing list. Instructions for joining it and many other
great mailing lists can be found <uri link="/main/en/lists.xml">Gentoo Linux
Mailing List Overview</uri>.

<p>
Another great security resource is the <uri

mailing list</uri>.
