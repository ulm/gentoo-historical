<title>Introduction</title>

<p>
Extra logging should be added to catch warnings or errors that might indicate
an ongoing attack or a successful compromise. Attackers often scan or probe
before attacking.
</p>

<p>
It's also vital that your log files are easily readable and manageable. Gentoo
Linux lets you choose between 3 different loggers when installing.

<title>Logging: Syslogd</title>
<body>

<p>
Syslogd is the most common logger for Linux and Unix in general.
It has some log rotation facilities, but using
<path>/usr/sbin/logrotate</path> in a cron job (logrotate is configured in
<path>/etc/logrotate.conf</path>) might prove to be more powerful as
<c>logrotate</c> has many features. How often
log rotation should be done depends on the system load.
</p>

<p>
Below is the standard <path>syslog.conf</path> with some added features. We
have uncommented the <c>cron</c> and <c>tty</c> lines and added a remote
logging server. To further enhance security you could add logging to two places.
</p>

<p>
Attackers will most likely try to erase their tracks by editing or deleting log
files. You can make it harder for them by logging to one or more remote logging
servers on other machines. Get more info about syslogd by executing <c>man
syslog</c>.

<title>Metalog</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://metalog.sourceforge.net">Metalog</uri> by Frank Dennis is not
able to log to a remote server, but it does have advantages when it comes to
performance and logging flexibility. It can log by program name, urgency,
facility (like syslogd), and comes with regular expression matching with which
you can launch external scripts when specific patterns are found. It is very good
at taking action when needed.
</p>

<p>
The standard configuration is usually enough.  If you want to be notified by
email whenever a password failure occurs use one of the following scripts.
</p>

<p>
For postfix:
</p>

<pre caption="/usr/local/sbin/mail_pwd_failures.sh for postfix">
#! /bin/sh
echo "$3" | mail -s "Warning (program : $2)" root
</pre>

<p>
For netqmail:
</p>

<pre caption="/usr/local/sbin/mail_pwd_failures.sh for netqmail">
#!/bin/sh
echo "To: root
Subject:Failure (Warning: $2)
$3
" | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject -f root
</pre>

<p>
Remember to make the script executable by issuing <c>/bin/chmod +x
/usr/local/sbin/mail_pwd_failures.sh</c>
</p>

<p>
Then uncomment the command line under "Password failures" in
<path>/etc/metalog/metalog.conf</path> like:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/metalog/metalog.conf">
command  = "/usr/local/sbin/mail_pwd_failures.sh"

<title>Syslog-ng</title>
<body>

<p>
Syslog-ng provides some of the same features as syslog and metalog with a small
difference. It can filter messages based on level and content (like metalog),
provide remote logging like syslog, handle logs from syslogd (even streams from
Solaris), write to a TTY, execute programs, and it can act as a logging server.
Basically it is the best of both loggers combined with advanced configuration.
</p>

<p>
Below is a classic configuration file slightly modified.
</p>

        chain_hostnames(no);

        <comment># The default action of syslog-ng is to log a STATS line
        # to the file every 10 minutes.  That's pretty ugly after a while.

        # how many messages syslog-ng missed (0).</comment>

<p>
Syslog-ng is very easy to configure, but it is also very easy to miss something
in the configuration file since it is huge. The author still promises some extra
features like encryption, authentication, compression and MAC (Mandatory Access
Control) control. With these options it will be a perfect for network logging,
since the attacker cannot spy on the log.
</p>

<p>
And syslog-ng does have one other advantage: it does not have to run as root!

<title>Log analysis with Logcheck</title>
<body>

<p>
Of course, keeping logs alone is only half the battle. An application such as
Logcheck can make regular log analysis much easier. Logcheck is a script,
accompanied by a binary called <c>logtail</c>, that runs from your cron daemon
and checks your logs against a set of rules for suspicious activity. It then
mails the output to root's mailbox.
</p>
<p>
Logcheck and logtail are part of the <c>app-admin/logsentry</c> package.
</p>
<p>
Logcheck uses four files to filter important log entries from the
unimportant. These files are <path>logcheck.hacking</path>, which contains known
hacking attack messages, <path>logcheck.violations</path>, which contains
patterns indicating security
violations, <path>logcheck.violations.ignore</path>, which contains keywords
likely to be matched by the violations file, allowing normal entries to be
ignored, and <path>logcheck.ignore</path>, which matches those entries to be
ignored.
</p>

<warn>
Do not leave <path>logcheck.violations.ignore</path> empty. Logcheck
uses <c>grep</c> to parse logs, some versions of which will take an empty file
to mean wildcard. All violations would thus be ignored.
</warn>
<!-- FIXME: Might want to add more details on logcheck here...I have to install
it on Gentoo to figure out how it's configured! -->
