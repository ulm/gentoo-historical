<title>Opening and creating files</title>
<body>
<p>
Opening and creating files is simple in nano, simply type: <pre># <i><c>nano filename</c></i></pre>Nano is a modeless editor so you can start typing immediately to insert text.  If you are editing a configuration file like <path>/etc/fstab</path> use the -w switch, for example: <pre># <i><c>nano -w /etc/fstab</c></i></pre><warn>It is very, very important that you use the -w switch when opening a config file.  Failure to do so may keep your system from booting or other bad things.</warn>

<title>Cutting and pasting</title>
<body>
<p>
To cut a single line line you use <c>^K</c>.  You simply hold down <c>CTRL</c> and <c>k</c> at the same time.  The line dissapears.  To paste it you simply move the cursor to where you want to paste and punch <c>^U</c> (<c>CTRL u</c>) on your keyboard.  BAM!  The line reapears.  Suppose you need to move a whole paragraph.  To move multiple lines simply cut each line one at a time, and then paste.  BAM!  The whole paragraph appears wherever you want it.	</p>
<p>
If you need a little more fine grained control then you need to mark the text.  Move the cursor to the beginning of the text you want to cut.  Hit <c>^^</c> (that's <c>ctrl ^</c> or <c>ctrl 6</c>).  Now move your cursor to the end of the text you want to cut.  The desired text should be highlighted now.  If need to cancel your text marking simply hit <c>^^</c> again.  Click <c>^K</c> to cut the text.  Use <c>^U</c> to paste it.  BAM!  Now that's cooking.

<title>Searching for text</title>
<body>
<p>
Searching for a string is easy as long as you think <em>"WhereIs"</em> instead of <em>"Search"</em>.  Simple hit <c>^W</c> (<c>CTRL w</c>) and type in your search string.  Like I said, easy.</p>
