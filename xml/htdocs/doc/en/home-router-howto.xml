<title>Introduction</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Building your own router out of old spare parts has many advantages 
over buying a pre-made canned router by say Linksys.  The biggest one by 
far is control over the connection.  The other advantages are left up to 
your imagination; just about anything can be done in this scenario, 
it's just a matter of needing it.
</p>

<p>
This guide will show you how to setup Network Address Translation (NAT) 
on the router (kernel and iptables), add and configure common services 
(Domain Name System (DNS) via dnsmasq, dhcp via dhcpcd, ADSL via 
rp-pppoe), and conclude with more elaborate and fun things that can be 
done (port forwarding, traffic shaping, proxies/caching, etc...).
</p>

<p>
Before getting started, there's a few basic requirements you must meet.  
First, you'll need a computer that has at least 2 Network Interface 
Cards (NICs) in it.  Next, you'll need the configuration settings for 
your internet connection (may include things like 
IP/DNS/Gateway/username/password).  Finally, you'll need a bit of spare 
time and some Gentoo loving.
</p>

<p>
The conventions used in this guide are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>eth0 - NIC connected to the Local Area Network (LAN)</li>
 <li>eth1 - NIC connected to the Wide Area Network (WAN)</li>
 <li>LAN utilizes the private 192.168.0.xxx network</li>
 <li>router is hardcoded to the standard 192.168.0.1 IP</li>
 <li>router is running Linux 2.4 or 2.6; you're on your own with 2.0/2.2</li>
</ul>

<impo>
Due to security precautions, I would highly suggest you shut down any 
unneeded services on the router until we have a chance to get the 
firewall up and rolling.  To view the currently running services, just 
run <c>rc-status</c>.
</impo>

<chapter>
<title>Kernel setup (know thyself first)</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Your kernel needs to have the drivers running for both your NICs.  To 
see if your cards are already setup, just run <c>ifconfig</c>.  Your 
output may differ slightly from the following, that's fine.  What 
matters is that the interface shows up at all.
</p>
<pre caption="Checking NICs">
# <i>ifconfig -a</i>
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:60:F5:07:07:B8
          BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x9800 

eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:60:F5:07:07:B9
          BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0x9400 
</pre>
<p>
If you do not see your two cards showing up and you're not sure what 
kind of cards you have, try running <c>lspci</c>.  You can get that from 
<c>emerge sys-apps/pciutils</c>.  Look for "Ethernet controller" in the 
output.  Once you have this information, go into your kernel and add 
support for the correct drivers.
</p>

<p>
The next thing you'll need is support for iptables and NAT (and packet 
shaping if you want).  The following list is split up into required 
(*), suggested (x), and shaper (s) features.  It does not matter whether 
you build the features into the kernel or as a module so long as when 
the feature is need, the correct module(s) are loaded (module loading 
is left to the reader as a fun exercise however).

<chapter>
<title>Hug the WAN (a.k.a. The Internet)</title>

<section>
<title>Intro</title>
<body>
<p>
There are many ways to connect to the internet so I'll just cover the 
ones I'm familiar with.  That leaves us with ADSL (PPPoE) and cable 
modems (static/dynamic).  If there are other methods out there, feel 
free to write up a little blurb and e-mail me.  Feel free to skip any of 
the following sections in this chapter that don't apply to you.  This 
chapter is just about getting the router connected to the internet via 
eth1.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>ADSL and PPPoE</title>
<body>

<p>
All the fancy PPPoE software has been bundled up into one little nice 
package nowadays called <uri link="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/">Roaring Penguin</uri>.  
Simply <c>emerge rp-pppoe</c> and you'll be on your way.  Remember how 
I said you'll need username/password information?  Well I wasn't lying 
so I hope you have it now!  Load up <path>/etc/ppp/pppoe.conf</path> in 
your favorite editor and set it up.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up eth1">
<comment>(Replace 'vla9h924' with your username and 'password' with your password)</comment>

# <i>nano /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf</i>
<comment># Ethernet card connected to ADSL modem
ETH=eth1
# ADSL user name.
USER=vla9h924</comment>
# <i>nano /etc/ppp/pap-secrets</i>
<comment># client    server  secret
"vla9h924" * "password"</comment>
# <i>nano /etc/conf.d/net</i>
<comment>Add an entry for ifconfig_eth1 and set it to adsl:
ifconfig_eth1=( "adsl" )</comment>
# <i>ln -s net.eth0 /etc/init.d/net.eth1</i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth1 default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/net.eth1 start</i>
</pre>

<warn>
When the DSL interface comes up, it will create ppp0.  Although your NIC 
is called eth1, the IP is actually bound to ppp0.  From now on, when you 
see examples that utilize 'eth1', substitute with 'ppp0'.
</warn>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Cable and/or dynamic/static IP</title>
<body>

<p>
If you have a static IP then you will need the few more details than if 
you have a dynamic IP.  For static users, you will need your IP, 
gateway, and DNS servers.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up eth1">
<comment>Dynamic IP Users:</comment>
# <i>emerge dhcpcd</i>
# <i>nano /etc/conf.d/net</i>
<comment>You'll need an entry like so:
ifconfig_eth1=( "dhcp" )</comment>

<comment>Static IP Users:</comment>
# <i>nano /etc/conf.d/net</i>
<comment>You'll need entries like so:
ifconfig_eth1=( "66.92.78.102 broadcast 66.92.78.255 netmask 255.255.255.0" )
routes_eth1=( "default gw 66.92.78.1" )</comment>
# <i>nano /etc/resolv.conf</i>
<comment>Add one line per DNS server:
nameserver 123.123.123.123</comment>

<comment>Dynamic and Static Setup:</comment>
# <i>ln -s net.eth0 /etc/init.d/net.eth1</i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth1 default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/net.eth1 start</i>
</pre>

<p>
You should be all set to go now.

<body>

<p>
This step is a breeze compared to the previous one.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up eth0">
# <i>nano /etc/conf.d/net</i>
<comment>Add a line like the following:
ifconfig_eth0=( "192.168.0.1 broadcast 192.168.0.255 netmask 255.255.255.0" )</comment>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth0 default</i>

<title>LAN Services (because we're nice people)</title>

<section>
<title>DHCP Server</title>
<body>
<p>
I bet it'd be nice if everyone else in your house could just plug 
their computers into the network and things would just work.  No need to 
remember mind-numbing details or make them stare at confusing 
configuration screens!  Life would be grand eh?  Introducing the Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and why you should care.
</p>

<p>
DHCP is exactly what its name implies.  It's a protocol that allows you 
to dynamically configure other hosts automatically.  You run a DHCP 
server on the router (dhcpd), give it all the information about your 
network (valid IPs, DNS servers, gateways, etc...), and then when the 
other hosts start up, they run a DHCP client to automatically configure 
themselves.  No fuss, no muss!  For even more information, you can 
always visit <uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP">Wikipedia</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up dhcpd">
# <i>emerge dhcp</i>
# <i>nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</i>
<comment>Here is a sample configuration file:
authoritative;
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	range 192.168.0.100 192.168.0.250;
	default-lease-time 259200;
	max-lease-time 518400;
	option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
	option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
	option routers 192.168.0.1;
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
}
</comment>
# <i>nano /etc/conf.d/dhcp</i>
<comment>Set IFACE="eth0"</comment>
# <i>rc-update add dhcp default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/dhcp start</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now your little router is a bona-fide DHCP server!  Plugin those 
computers and watch them work!  With Windows systems you should go into 
the TCP/IP Properties and select the 'Obtain an IP address 
automatically' and 'Obtain DNS server address automatically' options.  
Sometimes the changes aren't instantaneous, so you may have to run a 
command prompt and run <c>ipconfig /release</c> and <c>ipconfig 
/renew</c>.  But enough about Windows, let's get back to our favorite 
penguin.
</p>

<section>
<title>DNS Server</title>
<body>
<p>
When people want to visit a place on the internet, they remember names, 
not a string of useless numbers.  After all, what's easier to remember, 
ebay.com or 66.135.192.87?  This is where the DNS steps in.  DNS servers 
run all over the internet, and whenever someone wants to visit 'ebay.com', 
these servers turn 'ebay.com' (what we understand) into '66.135.192.87' 
(what our computers understand).  For even more information, you can 
always visit <uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS">Wikipedia</uri>.
</p>

<p>
You may have noticed in the previous section that we told the DHCP 
clients we have a DNS server at 192.168.0.1.  You may also remember that 
192.168.0.1 is our little router that we're making.  I don't remember 
setting up a DNS server ... so let's do so now!
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up dnsmasq">
# <i>emerge dnsmasq</i>
# <i>nano /etc/conf.d/dnsmasq</i>
<comment>Add "-i eth1" to DNSMASQ_OPTS</comment>
# <i>rc-update add dnsmasq</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/dnsmasq start</i>
</pre>

<p>
Well that was quick, but what did we do?  The great thing is, we didn't 
have to do very much!  You're welcome to choose other DNS servers if 
you're more comfortable with them, but the reason dnsmasq is great is 
because it was designed to do exactly what we want it for.  It's a 
little DNS caching/forwarding server for local networks.  We're not 
looking to provide our own DNS server here, just offer simple DNS 
services to everyone else on our LAN.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>NAT</title>
<body>

<p>
At this point, people on your network can talk to each other and they 
can look up hostnames via DNS, but they still can't actually connect to 
the internet.  While you may think that's great (more bandwidth for 
you!), I bet they're not too happy just yet.
</p>

<p>
This is where NAT steps in.  NAT is a way of connecting multiple computers 
in a private LAN to the internet when you only have a smaller number of 
IP addresses availabe to you.  Typically you were given 1 IP by your ISP, 
but you want to let your whole house connect to the internet.  NAT is the 
magic that makes this possible.  For even more information, you can 
always visit <uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT">Wikipedia</uri>.
</p>

<note>
Before we get started, make sure you have iptables on your system.  Although 
it is automatically installed on most systems, you may not have it.  If you 
don't, just run <c>emerge iptables</c>.
</note>

<pre caption="Setting up iptables">
<comment>First we flush our current rules</comment>
# <i>iptables -F</i>
# <i>iptables -t nat -F</i>

<comment>Then we lock our services so they only work from the LAN</comment>
# <i>iptables -I INPUT 1 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT</i>
# <i>iptables -I INPUT 1 -i lo -j ACCEPT</i>
# <i>iptables -A INPUT -p UDP --dport bootps -i ! eth0 -j REJECT</i>
# <i>iptables -A INPUT -p UDP --dport dns -i ! eth0 -j REJECT</i>

<comment>Drop TCP / UDP packets to privileged ports</comment>
# <i>iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -i ! eth0 -d 0/0 --dport 0:1023 -j DROP</i>
# <i>iptables -A INPUT -p UDP -i ! eth0 -d 0/0 --dport 0:1023 -j DROP</i>

<comment>Finally we add the rules for NAT</comment>
# <i>iptables -I FORWARD -i 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j DROP</i>
# <i>iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j ACCEPT</i>
# <i>iptables -A FORWARD -d 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j ACCEPT</i>
# <i>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE</i>
<comment>Tell the kernel that ip forwarding is OK</comment>
# <i>echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</i>
# <i>for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter ; do echo 1 > $f ; done</i>

<comment>This is so when we boot we don't have to run the rules by hand</comment>
# <i>/etc/init.d/iptables save</i>
# <i>rc-update add iptables default</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once you've typed out all of that, the rest of your network should now 
be able to use the internet as if they were directly connected 
themselves.

<title>Intro</title>
<body>
<p>
Believe it or not, you're done :).  From here on out, I'll cover a bunch 
of common topics that may interest you.  Everything in this chapter is 
completely optional.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Port Forwarding</title>
<body>
<p>
Sometimes you would like to be able to host services on a computer behind 
the router, or just to make your life easier when connecting remotely.  
Perhaps you want to run a FTP, HTTP, SSH, or VNC server on one or more 
machines behind your router and be able to connect to them all.  The only 
caveat is that you can only have one service/machine combo per port.  
For example, there is no practical way to setup three FTP servers behind 
your router and then try to connect to them all through port 21; only one 
can be on port 21 while the others would have to be on say port 123 and 
port 567.
</p>

<p>
All the port forwarding rules are of the form <c>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING 
[-p protocol] --dport [external port on router] -i eth1 -j DNAT --to [ip/port 
to forward to]</c>.  iptables does not accept hostnames when port forwarding.  
If you are forwarding an external port to the same port on the internal machine, 
you can omit the destination port.  See the iptables(8) page for more information.
</p>

<pre>
<comment>Forward port 2 to ssh on an internal host</comment>
# <i>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 2 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.2:22</i>

<comment>FTP forwarding to an internal host</comment>
# <i>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 21 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.56</i>

<comment>HTTP forwarding to an internal host</comment>
# <i>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.56</i>

<comment>VNC forwarding for internal hosts</comment>
# <i>iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 5900 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.2</i>
# <i>iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 5901 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.3:5900</i>
<comment>If you want to VNC in to 192.168.0.3, then just add ':1' to the router's hostname</comment>

<comment>Bittorrent forwarding</comment>
# <i>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 6881:6889 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.2</i>

<title>Identd (for IRC)</title>
<body>
<p>
Internet Relay Chat utilizes the ident service pretty heavily.  Now that 
the IRC clients are behind the router, we need a way to host ident for 
both the router and the clients.  One such server has been created 
called <c>midentd</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up ident">
# <i>emerge midentd</i>
# <i>rc-update add midentd default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/midentd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
There are a few other ident servers in portage.  Depending on your needs, 
I would recommend checking out <c>oidentd</c> and <c>fakeidentd</c>.
