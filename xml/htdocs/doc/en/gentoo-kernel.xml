<p>
As with everything else in Gentoo Linux, the philosophy of the Gentoo 
Kernel team is to give you, the user, as much freedom of choice as 
possible.  If you take a look at the output of <c>emerge -s sources</c> 
you see a large variety of kernels to choose from.  In this document, 
I will attempt to give you a brief rundown of the goals of each of the 
patch sets, which we at Gentoo design, and also explain the other kernel
sources we make available to you.

<title>genkernel</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>Genkernel</c> is a kernel toolset that can be used to autodetect your
hardware and configure your kernel automatically. This is usually recommended
for users who do not feel comfortable about compiling a kernel manually.
</p>

<p>
For more information, please read the <uri link="/doc/en/genkernel.xml">Gentoo
Linux Genkernel Guide</uri>.

<section>
<title>gentoo-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
For most users, the recommended kernel sources are the 
<c>gentoo-sources</c>. The <c>gentoo-sources</c> package contains various
kernel patches, designed to improve user experience with respect to different
areas. Speaking of <e>security</e>: you can find support for
<uri link="http://www.grsecurity.net">grsecurity</uri>, together with other
security enhancements and, naturally, all the recent fixes for known
vulnerabilities. The included patches deal also with <e>performance</e>
(including tweaks for desktop usage and support for recent hardware) and
<e>features</e> (supermount, bootsplash, the latest NTFS drivers, and more).
</p>

<p>
The <c>gentoo-sources</c> (together with <c>gentoo-dev-sources</c>) absorb
most of the resources of the Gentoo kernel team. They are brought to you by a
group of talented developers, which can count on the expertise of popular
kernel hacker Greg Kroah-Hartman, maintainer of udev and responsible for the
USB and PCI subsystems of the official linux kernel.

<title>vanilla-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The next kernel sources that many of you will probably be familiar with 
as Linux users are the <c>vanilla-sources</c>. These are the official 2.4
kernel sources released on <uri>http://www.kernel.org/</uri>, maintained
(contrary to popular belief) not by Linus Torvalds himself, but by Marcelo
Tosatti. Linus is the leader of active kernel development, but as he is
only one man, he passes off the maintenance of the stable 2.4 kernel branch
to someone he can trust to handle it once it has stabilized.  Thus, Alan
Cox became the maintainer of the Linux-2.2 kernel series and Marcelo 
Tosatti became the maintainer of the Linux-2.4 kernel series. This is 
what all the other patch sets in the 2.4 series are based on. Marcelo has
been doing an outstanding job with its maintenance and it can be 
counted on for stability and up-to-date (if not bleeding edge) hardware
support.
</p>

<p>
<c>vanilla-sources</c> are probably the most stable sources available
since they are the most tested and all possible kernel sources are based 
on them. If you don't need any of the extras that the other kernels supply 
then the <c>vanilla-sources</c> are your thing.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>gentoo-dev-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>gentoo-dev-sources</c> ebuild includes the most up-to-date 2.6 kernel
with Gentoo's optimized performance patches.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>development-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>development-sources</c> ebuild provides the stable 2.6 Linux kernel.  As
opposed to what the name might suggest, this kernel source is completely stable
and production-ready. This is the official 2.6 kernel released on
<uri>http://www.kernel.org/</uri>.
</p>

<section>
<title>gs-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
For users to whom desktop interactive performance comes as a secondary 
priority to reliability and hardware support, we have the 
<c>gs-sources</c>.  GS stands for Gentoo Stable (creative, aren't we?).  
This patch set is tuned and tested to provide the best support for the 
latest hardware and ensures that your mission critical servers will be 
up when you need them.  This kernel doesn't have some of the most 
aggressive performance tuning patches from the <c>gentoo-sources</c>, 
but rest assured, the great performance that you know and love from the
vanilla kernels are alive and well. Where possible and without 
compromising stability we add server related performance patches.
</p>

<p>
This kernel provides support for the latest ACPI subsystem, EVMS, ECC
(required for HA Linux systems), Encrypted Loopback devices, NTFS, Win4Lin
and XFS. It also contains updates for IDE, ext3 and several network cards
amongst other patches.
</p>

<p>
In other words, these sources are perfect for servers and
High-Availability systems.
</p>

<p>
The following USE-flags can be set to select optional patches:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Flags</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><ti>crypt</ti><ti>Apply cryptographic patches</ti></tr>
</table>

<section>
<title>hardened-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>hardened-sources</c> provides patches for the various subprojects of
Gentoo Hardened (such as support for LSM/SELinux and GRSecurity), together 
with stability/security-enhancements. Check 
<uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/</uri> for more information.
</p>

<p>
The following USE-flags can be set to select optional patches:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Flags</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><ti>selinux</ti><ti>Substitute grSecurity with SELinux support</ti></tr>
</table>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>hardened-dev-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>hardened-dev-sources</c> use the 2.6 kernel with the patches provided by the
various subprojects of Gentoo Hardened.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Architecture dependent kernels</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>alpha-sources</c>, <c>hppa-sources</c>, <c>hppa-dev-sources</c>,
<c>ia64-sources</c>, <c>mips-sources</c>, <c>ppc-sources</c>,
<c>pegasos-sources</c>, <c>pegasos-dev-sources</c>, <c>sparc-sources</c>
and <c>xbox-sources</c> are, as their names suggest, patched to run best on 
specific architectures.  They also contain some of the patches for hardware and 
features support from the other patch sets mentioned above and below. Kernel
sources that contains a "-dev-" means that the sources use the 2.6 kernel
instead of the 2.4 kernel.
</p>

<p>
The <c>compaq-sources</c> provide RedHat's kernel sources for Alpha, 
maintained by Compaq.

<title>The Choices, Part II</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Now I'm going to try to briefly describe some of the other 
<path>sys-kernel/*-sources</path> which you saw scroll by when you ran 
<c>emerge -s sources</c>. Lets take them in alphabetical order.  
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>aa-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
First we have <c>aa-sources</c>. This is Andrea Arcangeli's patch set.  
Andrea is known as an amazing coder by many other kernel hackers.  His 
kernel patch set has some of the most aggressively tuned VM (Virtual 
Memory) patches known to mankind.
</p>

<p>
It also provides User Mode Linux support (check out our 
<uri link="/doc/en/uml.xml">UML Guide</uri> for more information) and 
the latest TUX Webserver (an in-kernel webserver).
</p>

<p>
If you have Memory Management troubles with other kernels, 
<c>aa-sources</c> can be your solution. If you want to optimize Linux's
Memory Management for your system, <c>aa-sources</c> is <e>definitely</e>
what you need.
</p>

<p>
Visit 
<uri>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.6</uri>
for more information about all the patches in these kernel sources.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>ck-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>ck-sources</c> is Con Kolivas's kernel patch set.  This kernel is 
<e>HIGHLY</e> tuned for desktop performance at the expense of 
throughput and some of the scheduler's ability to prioritize 
applications.  Con Kolivas benchmarks kernels to find the best 
combination of features for desktop use.  See 
<uri>http://kernel.kolivas.org</uri> for more information on Con and his
patches.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>grsec-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>grsec-sources</c> kernel source is patched with the latest GRSecurity
updates (GRSecurity version 2.0 and up) which includes, amongst other
security-related patches, support for PaX.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>mm-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>mm-sources</c> are based on the <c>development-sources</c> and contain
Andrew Morton's patch set. They include the experimental and bleeding-edge
features that are going to be included in the official kernel (or that are
going to be rejected because they set your box on fire). They are known to be
always moving at a fast pace and can change radically from one week to the
other; kernel hackers use them as a testing ground for new stuff.
</p>

<p>
If you really want to live on the edge and you think 
<c>development-sources</c> are for wussies, then try out
<c>mm-sources</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>openmosix-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>openmosix-sources</c> are patched to support the openMosix system 
(like MOSIX but Open Source).  For more information see 
<uri>http://www.openmosix.org</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>pac-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>pac-sources</c> kernel tree is patched with Bernhard Rosenkraenzer's
(bero) patches.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>selinux-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>selinux-sources</c> from <uri>http://www.nsa.gov/selinux</uri> are 
patches for the security conscious to support the LSM (Linux Security 
Modules) and the Flask Security Architecture.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>usermode-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>usermode-sources</c> are the User Mode Linux kernel patches.  This 
kernel is designed to allow Linux to run within Linux to run within Linux
to ... User Mode Linux is intended for testing and virtual server support.
For more information about this amazing tribute to the stability and 
scalability of Linux, see <uri>http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net</uri>.

<section>
<title>win4lin-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>win4lin-sources</c> are patched to support the userland win4lin tools 
that allow Linux users to run many Microsoft Windows (TM) applications
at almost native speeds.  See <uri>http://www.netraverse.com/</uri> for more 
information.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>wolk-sources</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>wolk-sources</c> contains the <e>Working Overloaded Linux Kernel</e> from 
<uri>http://sourceforge.net/projects/wolk</uri>. This kernel contains
many patches of a wide variety, all combined into the kernel with
extreme care. This allows you to configure nearly every one into and out
of the kernel at compile time -- so the kernel will work with nearly any
combination of the patches.
</p>

<p>
If you need a certain combination of patches that you cannot find in other
kernel sources, WOLK is definitely worth a shot.
