<title>Use the Right Tools</title>
<body>

<p>
Linux has great support for printers; the right tool for the job is called CUPS
(<uri link="http://www.cups.org">Common Unix Printing System</uri>). Since the
beginning of the project, back in 1999, the installation and maintenance of CUPS
has improved dramatically. 
</p>

<p>
In this document we will cover how to use CUPS to setup a local or networked 
printer. We will not go in too much detail since the project has <uri
link="http://www.cups.org/documentation.php">great documentation</uri> available
for advanced usage.

<chapter>
<title>Configure your Kernel</title>
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
When you want to install a printer on your system you need to know how your
printer will be attached to your system. Is it through a local port like LPT or
USB, or is it networked? And if it is, does it use the Internet Printing
Protocol (IPP) or is it through the Microsoft Windows SMB-CIFS protocol
(Microsoft Windows Sharing)?
</p>

<p>
The next few sections explain what minimal kernel configuration you need. Of
course, this depends on how your printer is going to be attached to your system,
so for your convenience we have separated the instructions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><uri link="#lpt">Locally Attached Printer (LPT)</uri></li>
  <li><uri link="#usb">Locally Attached Printer (USB)</uri></li>
  <li><uri link="#ipp">Remotely Attached Printer (IPP)</uri></li>
  <li><uri link="#smb-cifs">Remotely Attached Printer (SMB-CIFS)</uri></li>
</ul>

<p>
So manoeuvre to <path>/usr/src/linux</path> and run <c>make menuconfig</c> to
enter the kernel configuration. If you used <c>genkernel</c> to configure your
kernel, you should still perform these steps just to make sure nothing was
missed out.
</p>

<p>
In the next configuration examples, we will add the necessary support <e>in</e>
the kernel, not as modules. This is not mandatory; if you want you can easily
use modular support. Don't forget to load the appropriate modules afterwards.
We also use a 2.6 kernel configuration example; 2.4 users might find the
appropriate configuration directives elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
Now go to the appropriate section to configure (or check) your kernel.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="lpt">
<title>Locally Attached Printer (LPT)</title>
<body>

<p>
The LPT port is generally used to identify the parallel printer port. You need
to enable parallel port support first, then PC-style parallel port support
(unless you are a SPARC user) after which you enable parallel printer support.

<p>
Some users might need to enable other options in the <c>Parallel port
support</c> section. Check the kernel configuration <c>Help</c>
function for more information.
</p>

<p>
That's it; quit the kernel configuration and rebuild your kernel. Don't forget
to copy the new kernel image to the <path>/boot</path> location (and don't
forget to mount <path>/boot</path> if needed) and update your boot loader
configuration prior to rebooting your system.

<title>Installing and Configuring CUPS</title>
<section>
<title>Installation</title>
<body>

<p>
Installing CUPS with Gentoo is a breeze. CUPS has a few optional features that
might interest you. To enable or disable those features, use the USE flags
associated with them.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>USE flag</th>
  <th>Impact on CUPS</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>nls</ti>
  <ti>
    Enable National Language Support. With nls in place, CUPS is able to deliver
    localized feedback so you can hopefully enjoy CUPS in your native
    language.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>pam</ti>
  <ti>
    If you need print job authentication through the Pluggable Authentication
    Modules, this will activate PAM support for CUPS.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>samba</ti>
  <ti>
    If you want to be able to share locally attached printers to Windows systems
    on your network using the SMB-CIFS protocol, or you want to be able to use
    shared printers from Windows systems, you need SAMBA support.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>slp</ti>
  <ti>
    In a managed environment the printer might be made available as a service to
    others. With the Service Location Protocol you can easily find and configure
    a service on your system. Enable this USE flag if your printer is available
    as a service or should be made available as one.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ssl</ti>
  <ti>
    If you want remote authentication and/or privacy, you need support for the
    Secure Socket Layer, allowing for encrypted printing sessions. Support for
    SSL must be available on all participating systems in your network.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Check the current USE settings. If you want to deviate from your current USE
settings for CUPS alone, add the appropriate USE flags to
<path>/etc/portage/package.use</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="USE flag settings for CUPS">

<p>
If you are happy with the result, have Portage install CUPS.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing CUPS">
# <i>emerge cups</i>

<p>
The build process might inform you to run <c>rc-update add coldplug default</c>
if you are using a USB printer and have the necessary support as kernel modules.
This will allow any USB kernel modules to be loaded automatically at boot.
</p>

<p>
If the printer is attached to your system locally, you need to load CUPS 
automatically on start-up. Make sure your printer is attached and powered on 
before you start CUPS.
</p>

<pre caption="Automatically starting CUPS">
# <i>/etc/init.d/cupsd start</i>

</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
The default CUPS server configuration in <path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path> 
is sufficient for most users. However, several users might need some changes 
to the CUPS configuration.
</p>

<p>
In the next sections we cover a few changes that are often needed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In <uri link="#remote_usage">Remote Printer Access</uri> we allow other
    systems to use the printer attached to this Linux workstation.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <uri link="#remote_admin">CUPS Remote Administration</uri> we grant 
    access to the CUPS administration from remote systems
  </li>
  <li>
    In <uri link="#windows_pcl">Enable Support for Windows PCL Drivers</uri> you
    configure CUPS to support Windows PCL drivers. This is advised if you want
    Windows systems to be able to use a Samba-shared printer as most Windows
    drivers are PCL drivers.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <uri link="#setup_remote">Setting Up a Remote Printer</uri> we
    configure this system to use a printer attached to another system (not
    Windows share).
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section id="remote_usage">
<title>Remote Printer Access</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want other systems to use your printer through IPP you need to
explicitly grant access to the printer in <path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path>. If
you want to share your printer using SAMBA, this change is not needed.
</p>

<p>
Open up <path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path> in your favorite editor and add in an
<c>Allow</c> line for the system(s) that should be able to reach to your 
printer. In the next example, we grant access to the printer from any system 
whose IP address starts with <c>192.168.0</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Allowing remote access to the printer">
&lt;Location /&gt;
Order Deny,Allow

&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section id="remote_admin">
<title>CUPS Remote Administration</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are interested in remote administration, you need to grant access from
other systems than just localhost to the CUPS administration. Edit
<path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path> and have it explicitly grant access to the
systems you want. For instance, to grant access to the system with IP address
of 192.168.0.3:
</p>

Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
<i>Allow From 192.168.0.3</i>
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Do not forget to restart CUPS after making changes to
<path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path> by running <c>/etc/init.d/cupsd restart</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="windows_pcl">
<title>Enable Support for Windows PCL Drivers</title>
<body>

<p>
PCL drivers send raw data to the print server. To enable raw printing on CUPS,
you need to edit <path>/etc/cups/mime.types</path> and uncomment the line
<c>application/octet-stream</c>. Then you need to edit
<path>/etc/cups/mime.convs</path> and uncomment the line containing
<c>application/octet-stream</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Enable support for raw printing">

<section id="setup_remote">
<title>Setting Up a Remote Printer</title>
<body>

<p>
If the printers are attached to a remote CUPS-powered server you can easily 
set up your system to use the remote printer by changing the 
<path>/etc/cups/client.conf</path> file.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the printer is attached to a system called <c>printserver.mydomain</c>,
open up <path>/etc/cups/client.conf</path> with your favorite editor and set the
<c>ServerName</c> directive:
</p>

<pre caption="Editing client.conf">
# <i>vim /etc/cups/client.conf</i>

<comment>(Substitute printserver.mydomain with your print server name)</comment>
ServerName <i>printserver.mydomain</i>
</pre>

<p>
The remote system will have a default printer setting which you will be using.
If you want to change the default printer, use <c>lpoptions</c>:
</p>

kernel stating that it has successfully detected your printer. However this is
merely an indication and not a requirement.

<title>Installing the Printer</title>
<body>

<p>
To have the printer installed on your system, fire up your browser and have it
point to <uri link="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</uri>. You will
be greeted by the CUPS web interface from which you can perform all
administrative tasks.
</p>

<p>
Go to <e>Administration</e> and enter your root login and password information
at the box. Then, when you have reached the administrative interface, click on
<e>Add Printer</e>. You will be greeted by a new screen allowing you to enter
the following information:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <e>spooler name</e>, a short but descriptive name used on your system to
    identify the printer. This name should not contain spaces or any special
    characters. For instance, for the HP LaserJet 5P you could say
    <c>hpljet5p</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <e>location</e>, a description where the printer is physically located
    (for instance in your room, or in the kitchen right next to your dish
    washer, ...). This is to help maintaining several printers.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <e>description</e> in which you should place a full description of the
    printer. A common use is the full printer name (like "HP LaserJet 5P").
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The next screen asks you for the device where the printer listens to. You will
have the choice of several devices. The next table covers a few possible 
devices, but the list is not exhaustive.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Device</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>AppSocket/HP JetDirect</ti>
  <ti>
    This special device allows for network printers to be accessible through a
    HP JetDirect socket. Only specific printers support this.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP or HTTP)</ti>
  <ti>
    Use this to reach your remote printer through the IPP protocol either
    directly (IPP) or through HTTP. 
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>LPD/LPR Host or Printer</ti>
  <ti>
    Select this if the printer is remote and attached to a LPD/LPR server.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>Parallel Port #1</ti>
  <ti>
    Select this when the printer is locally attached to your parallel port
    (LPT). When the printer is automatically detected its name will be appended
    to the device as well.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>USB Printer #1</ti>
  <ti>
    Select this when the printer is locally attached to a USB port. The printer
    name should automatically be appended to the device name.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If you are installing a remote printer, you will be asked for the URI to the
printer:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    An LPD printer server requires a <c>lpd://hostname/queue</c> syntax
  </li>
  <li>
    An HP JetDirect printer requires a <c>socket://hostname</c> syntax
  </li>
  <li>
    An IPP printer requires a <c>http://hostname:631/ipp/queue</c> or
    <c>ipp://hostname/ipp/queue</c> syntax
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Next, select the printer manufacturer in the adjoining screen and the model 
type and number in the subsequent one. For many printers you will find 
multiple drivers. You can either select one now or search on 
<uri link="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi">LinuxPrinting.org's 
Printer List</uri> for a good driver. You can change drivers easily later on.
</p>

<p>
Once the driver is selected, CUPS will inform you that the printer has been
added successfully to the system. You can now go to the printer management page
on the administration interface and select <c>Configure Printer</c> to change
the printer settings (resolution, page format, ...).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Testing and Reconfiguring the Printer</title>
<body>

<p>
To verify if the printer is working correctly, go to the printer administration
page, select your printer and click on <c>Print Test Page</c>. 
</p>

<p>
If the printer does not seem to work correctly, click on <c>Modify Printer</c> 
to reconfigure the printer. You will be greeted with the same screens as 
during the first installation but the defaults will now be your current
configuration.
</p>

<p>
If you have no idea why your printer does not function, you might get a clue by
looking at <path>/var/log/cups/error_log</path>. In the next example we find out
that there is a permission error, probably due to a wrong <c>Allow</c> setting
in <path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
Many printer drivers exist; to find out which one has the best performance for
your printer, visit the <uri

List</uri>. Select your brand and type to find out what driver the site
recommends. For instance, for the HP LaserJet 5P, the site recommends the
<c>ljet4</c> driver.
</p>

<p>
Download the PPD file from the site and place it in
<path>/usr/share/cups/model</path>. This will make the driver available through
the CUPS web interface. Now reconfigure your printer as described above.

<body>

<p>
To share the printer on the SMB-CIFS network, you must have SAMBA installed and
configured correctly. How to do this is beyond the scope of this document, but
we will quickly deal with the configuration of SAMBA for shared printers.
</p>

<p>
Open <path>/etc/samba/smb.conf</path> with your favorite editor and add a
<c>[printers]</c> section to it:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding a [printers] section">
[printers]
  comment      = All printers
  path         = /var/spool/samba
  browseable   = no
  guest ok     = no
  writable     = no
  printable    = yes
  public       = yes
  printer name = hpljet5p
</pre>

<p>
Now navigate to the top of the <path>smb.conf</path> file until you are inside
the <c>[global]</c> section. Then locate the <c>printcap name</c> and
<c>printing</c> settings and set each of them to <c>cups</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the [global] section">
[global]
  <comment>(...)</comment>
  printcap name = <i>cups</i>
  printing      = <i>cups</i>
</pre>

<p>
Make sure you enabled the <uri link="#windows_pcl">Windows PCL drivers</uri>
support in CUPS. Then, restart the <c>smb</c> service to have the changes take
effect.

<title>Configuring a Linux Client for a Windows Print Server</title>

<p>
First of all, make sure that the printer is shared on your Windows system.
</p>

<p>
Next, in the CUPS web interface, configure your printer as described previously.
You will notice that CUPS has added another driver called <c>Windows Printer via
SAMBA</c>. Select it and use the
<c>smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printername</c> or
<c>smb://server/printername</c> syntax for the URI.

With <uri link="http://gtklp.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">Gtk-LP</uri> you can
install, modify and configure your printer from a stand-alone Gtk application.
It uses CUPS and provides all standard CUPS capabilities as well. Definitely
worth checking out if you dislike the CUPS Web interface or want a stand-alone
application for your day-to-day printing routines.
