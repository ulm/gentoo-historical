			<title>Local Printing Using CUPS</title> 
			<section> 
				<title>Installation Using CUPS</title> 
				
				<body> 
 
				<p>Setting up printing in Gentoo Linux is a relatively painless task, thanks
				to some great programs such as CUPS (the Common Unix Printing
				System) and foomatic. Both of these programs are
				currently in the Portage tree, and they are very easy to set up for the
				end user.
				</p> 
				
				<p>Please be aware the cups is cross-desktop, i.e. you can follow
				these directions to get printing working under GNOME or KDE.
				There are other options, such as KDE's print setup, but I believe that 
				CUPS is the easiest to setup, and the most scalable.
				</p>
				
				<p>Before emerging CUPS, it is a  good idea to add the necessary
				USE flags to <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.
				</p>

				<pre caption = "Editing /etc/make.conf">
<comment>add <i>cups</i> to your existing USE var list. </comment>
USE="cups other_var1 other_var2
				</pre>

				<p>For more information on USE variables, please see the 
				<uri link = "http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/use-howto.xml">USE HOWTO</uri>.
				</p>

				
				<pre caption = "Emerging necessary packages"> 
# <c>emerge cups</c>  
# <c>emerge foomatic </c>
				</pre> 
 
				<p>Now that the necessary packages are installed, it is time to install the printer.
				</p>
				
				<p>Depending on what type of printer connection you will be using, it will
				be necessary to enable either parallel port or USB port printer connections
				in the kernel.
				</p>
				
				<note>If you are not sure on how to compile the kernel, the official
				Linux Kernel-HOWTO can be found <uri link="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">here</uri>.
				</note>
 
				<p>After the kernel is built, and your computer restarted, it is time to load the 
				necessary modules:
				</p>
			
				<pre caption = "Loading USB modules"> 
# <c>modprobe usbcore</c> 
# <c>modprobe printer</c> 
				</pre> 
 
				<p>After the modules have loaded successfully, plug in the printer, and check
				<path>/var/log/messages</path> to see if it was detected.
				</p> 
 
				<pre caption = "Checking Kernel Messages"> 
# <c>tail -f /var/log/messages</c> 
				</pre> 
 
				<p>You should see something like this:
				</p>
   
				<pre caption = "/var/log/messages Output">
<c>hub.c: USB new device connect on bus2/2, assigned device number 2 </c> 
<c>printer.c: usblp0: USB bidirectional printer dev 2 if 0 alt 1 proto 2 vid 0x03F0 pid 0x1104 </c>
				</pre>    
 
				<note>If you are using a parallel port printer, make sure that it is
				plugged in before you reboot. Once the system is up, issue a <c>dmesg</c>
				and look for evidence of the kernel detecting your printer.
				</note> 
 
				<p>Before setting up the printer with CUPS, we can test it with some simple low-level commands.
				</p> 

				<pre caption = "Printer Testing Using cat">
# <c>touch test.txt</c>
# <c>echo "Hello World" > test.txt</c>
# <c>cat test.txt > /dev/usb/lp0 </c>

<comment> Alternatively, for parallel port printers: </comment>
# <c>cat test.txt > /dev/lp0 </c>
				</pre>

				<title>PPD File Configuration</title> 
				
				<body> 
				<p>Now it is time to configure the printer and CUPS. If you are using an HP Inkjet printer,
				it is necessary to emerge the <c>hpijs</c> printer driver. 
				This driver handles all of the Postscript interpretation necessary to make the HP printer work.
				If you are using a non-HP printer, it may be necessary to locate the third party drivers for it.
				</p> 
 
				<note>The <c>hpijs</c> driver is for HP Inkjet printers only. If you are using a HP Laserjet,
				support may already be available via the GNOME printing system. 
				If you are using a non HP Inkjet printer, skip down below to the configuration process.
				</note> 
 
				<pre caption = "Emerging hpijs"> 
# <c>emerge hpijs</c> 
				</pre> 
 
				<impo>The documentation from HP for the <c>hpijs</c> driver is in
				<path>/usr/share/doc/hpijs-&lt;version&gt;</path>. The author <i>highly</i> recommends reading this.
				</impo> 
 
				<p> In order for your printer to interpret Postscipt correctly, CUPS needs
				a PPD (Printer Postscript Definition) file. The easiest way to generate a PPD is through foomatic.
				</p>

				<p>Three pieces of information are necessary in order to make the below command work;
				you need your printer model, printer device, and your print driver (if you are not using hpijs).
				The printer ID and driver can be <c>grepped</c> from foomatic's database, and the print device is
				what device node your printer is connected to (i.e. <path>/dev/lp0</path>).
				The below example uses <i>hpijs</i> as its driver, but please replace <i>hpijs</i> with
				your driver name if you are not using an HP printer.
				</p>

				<pre caption = "Using foomatic">
# <c>grep $printer_model /usr/share/foomatic/db/source/printer/* </c>
# <c>grep $print_device /usr/share/foomatic/db/source/driver/* </c>
# <c>foomatic-configure -s cups -p $printer_model -c $print_device -n queue name -d hpijs </c>
				</pre>
 
				<impo>If you are having problems, please refer to the foomatic documentation
				<uri link="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic/USAGE">here</uri> 
				and the <uri link="http://www.linuxprinting.org">linuxprinting.org</uri>
				homepage for more information.
				</impo>

				<title>CUPS Configuration</title> 
				<body> 

				<p>Since the printer itself is now configured, now CUPS must be setup
				to handle the printer queueing. CUPS can be accessed via web browser on port 631 of the printer server.
				</p>

				<impo>CUPS has a built in configuration file for the daemon that should, but does
				not have to, be modified. You might want to take a gander at it, it is
				<path>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</path>.
				</impo>
	
				<pre caption = "Adding CUPS to default runlevel, and starting CUPS">
# <c>rc-update add cupsd default</c>
# <c>/etc/init.d/cupsd start</c>
				</pre>

				<p>The CUPS daemon should now be running, so open up your favorite browser and point
				it to <uri link="http://127.0.0.1:631">here</uri>. 
				</p> 
				
				<p>Hopefully, you will be greeted with the CUPS configuration mainscreen.  
				Click on the <i>administration</i> tab at the top of the page, and either enter
				your root password, or the name of someone that is in the <i>lp</i> group. 
				Once authenticated, click on the <i>Add Printer</i> tab under the <i>printers</i> section.
				Enter the necessary name, description, and location of your printer. 
				You must make your printer name exactly the same name of your printer queue that you
				specified for foomatic. You now need to select the device that you printer is connected to. 
				Select the make of the printer, and continue on. On the next page choose your printer from the list.
				</p>

				<p>Configuration is done! Click on the name of your printer, then try printing a test page.
				Voila, your printer is setup is completed!
				</p>

				<note>If the printer does not work for some reason, go to the directory where you
				told your CUPS logs to be stored, and look through <i>error_log</i>.

			<title>Configuring The GIMP, OpenOffice.org1.0, and Abiword to print using CUPS.</title>
			<section>
				<title>The GIMP</title>
				<body>

				<p>Before starting, we have to emerge The Gimp's CUPS printing extentions.
				</p>

				<pre caption="Emerging gimp-print-cups">
# <c>emerge gimp-print-cups </c>
				</pre>

				<p>Now, open up The GIMP, and open an existing picture, or just some blank pic, it really doesn't
				matter because all we are looking for is the <i>File</i> menu. 
				Right click on the image and go to <i>File/Print</i> The dialog for printing should come up,
				and when it does, click on new printer. 
				If your printer is not already listed, type in the name of your printer, then select your
				printer type. Ok, you are now setup to print from The GIMP. Play with the settings and have some fun.
				</p>

				<title>OpenOffice.org1.0</title>
				<body>	

				<p>Printing with OpenOffice.org1.0 is not much more difficult.
				Goto <path>OpenOffice.org1.0/program </path>, and run <c>spadmin</c>. 
				Make a new printer, and when presented with the <i>Choose a Driver</i> screen,
				click on <i>import</i> and browse to the location of your printer's PPD In our case,
				it would be <path>/etc/cups/ppd</path>. 
				Use the default print commands, name the printer, set it as default, and you are ready to go!
				Start OpenOffice.org1.0 and go to the print screen, and select your printer.
				Print a test page, and you are done.
				</p>

				<title>Abiword</title>
				<body>

				<warn>Abiword segfaults and crashes with CUPS-1.1.15-r2. 
				It is recommended to go back to the .14 series as that may fix the problem.
				</warn>

				<p>TODO: add Abiword support.</p>
				
				</body>

			<p>Local printing is now complete, now to add network support.

			<title>Network printing using CUPS and SAMBA</title>
			<section>
				<title>Printing to a Windows Printer from a Linux Machine</title>
				<body>

				<p>First, SAMBA has to be installed for the next two network printing options to work. 
				</p>

				<pre caption = "Installing SAMBA">
# <c>emerge samba</c>
				</pre>

				<note>For more information on SAMBA, the official SAMBA HOWTO is located
				<uri link="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SMB-HOWTO.html">here</uri>
				</note>

				<p> First, we use <i>foomatic</i> to generate the PPD for the remote printer.
				Don't forget to check if your printer is compatible with Linux or not at the
				<uri link="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi">linuxprinting.org</uri> 
				printer database. Now, we tell <i>foomatic</i> where and what the printer is, and then
				move the generated PPD to the correct location.
				</p>

				<pre caption = "Using foomatic with Samba">
<codenote>Please acquire printer model and your driver name using the aforementioned steps. </codenote>
# <c>foomatic-configure -s cups -p $printer_model -c smb://user:password@server/share -n queue name -d hpijs </c> 
				</pre>

				<p>Now, point your favorite web browser 
				<uri link="http://localhost:631">here</uri> to bring up the CUPS configuration GUI. 
				Follow the above steps to add a printer, but this time, when asked what port the printer is on,
				specify <i>smb://user:password@server/share</i>. 
				This will point CUPS to the printer on the Windows machine.

				<title>Using Linux as a Windows Compatible Print Server</title>
				<body>

				<p>Linux makes a great print server, then again, it makes a great everything server.
				The first thing to do is edit <path>/etc/samba/smb.conf</path> to fit your settings. 
				The <i>smb.conf</i> file contains all of the settings that will make your Linux box look
				like a Windows NT server to any Windows machine. 
				I have included an very utilitarian example <i>smb.conf</i> below. Edit as needed to fit
				your network environment. 
				</p>

				<pre caption = "Sample smb.conf">
<c>[global]</c>

      <c>workgroup = YOUR_WORKGROUP</c>
      <c>server string = Gentoo Linux Server</c>
      <c>encrypt passwords = True</c>
      <c>security = user</c>
      <c>smb passwd file = /etc/samba/private/smbpasswd</c>
      <c>log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m</c>
      <c>socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY</c>
      <c>domain master = Yes</c>
      <c>local master = Yes</c>
      <c>preferred master = Yes</c>
      <c>os level = 65</c>
      <c>dns proxy = No</c>
      <c>name resolve order = lmhosts host bcast</c>
      <c>bind interfaces only = True</c>
      <c>interfaces = eth0</c>
      <c>hosts deny = ALL</c>
      <c>hosts allow = 192.168.1.4 127.0.0.1 (list of allow hosts here) </c>
      <c>debug level = 1</c>
      <c>create mask = 0644</c>
      <c>directory mask = 0755</c>
      <c>level2 oplocks = True</c>
      <c>read raw = no</c>
      <c>write cache size = 262144</c>

<c>[printers]</c>
      <c>comment = All Printer</c>
      <c>path = /var/spool/samba</c>
      <c>browseable = no </c>
   
				</pre>

				<p>Now that the SAMBA is configured, restart samba, go to your Windows machine
				and install a network printer. Piece of cake, eh?
