<title>Larry the Cow Embraces Freedom</title>

<body>
  
<p>
After years of <b>"Larry the Cow"</b> being identified with Gentoo and the
Gentoo community, Larry has been traced to his creator, <uri
  link="http://new.myfonts.com/person/Ethan_Paul_Dunham/"> Ethan Dunham</uri>
of <uri link="http://www.fonthead.com/">Fonthead Design Inc.</uri>. Larry is a
part of a bigger collection of <uri
  link="http://www.fonthead.com/fonts/Font-Heads">Font Heads</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Following discussions with <uri
  link="http://new.myfonts.com/person/Ethan_Paul_Dunham/"> Ethan Dunham</uri>,
involving <mail>sping</mail> from the <uri
  link="/proj/en/desktop/artwork/">Gentoo Artwork Project</uri> and
<mail>neddyseagoon</mail>, on behalf of the <uri link="/foundation/en/">Gentoo
  Foundation</uri>, <uri link="http://www.fonthead.com/">Fonthead Design
  Inc.</uri> has agreed to grant  permission to use the artwork of letter
&quot;s&quot; of font &quot;Font Heads&quot; showing the head of a cow under
the terms of the <uri
  link="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license</uri> so that the Gentoo community can
enjoy the freedom to use their mascot.
</p>

<p>
We encourage our developers and users to create <uri
  link="/proj/en/desktop/artwork/artwork.xml">Gentoo artwork</uri> based on our
newly released Larry.
