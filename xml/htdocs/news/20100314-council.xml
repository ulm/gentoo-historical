  <b>What:</b> Gentoo Council Meeting of 8 March 2010.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Voting by email</b>
</p>

<p>
Ideas seemed to converge on how to vote by email but it was noted that this
would constitute a change of GLEP39 which the council can't modify without an
all-developers vote. Since there were already other changes planned or suggested
to GLEP 39 it was decided that the council would work on a new text and submit
it to a vote when ready. Calchan has volunteered to gather all ideas and work on
the text.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Do we want a policy for changes in metadata.xml?</b>
</p>

<p>
Adding such information to metadata.xml was considered a bad idea for two
reasons: this information is of no use to the users and would bloat the file for
no good reason, and it would be a technical answer to a mostly social problem.
It was suggested that reducing territoriality could help. Ideas were proposed
like making it official that after sending an email to the maintainers and
waiting one week anybody could touch a package.
</p>

<p>
In the end it wasn't clear what exact problem was to be solved. So scarabeus
volunteered to animate the discussions on the mailing list. The goal is to find
out what the source of the problem is and what solution(s) we can apply.
