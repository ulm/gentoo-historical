	<title>Important Portage/rsync news and updates</title>
<body>

<p><b>According to <uri link="http://www.distrowatch.com/top.php">DistroWatch.com</uri>, Gentoo Linux is one of the top ten
Linux distributions.</b>  That's nifty!  However, the recent dramatic growth in the number of users using Gentoo Linux
has created its share of growing pains.  For one, we had to do a not-so-graceful <e>change of rsync mirror hostname</e> in order
to launch our new rsync mirroring system (required in order to cope with the tremendous increase in rsync usage.)  This,
in turn, resulted in very old versions of Portage to be unable to rsync.  If you aren't able to rsync, <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org/pipermail/gentoo-announce/2002-May/000161.html">here's the information you need</uri> to switch over to our new rsync mirror
system.  <b>On a related note, within the next week we'll be phasing out support for Portage 1.8.8 and along with it the 1.0_rc6 profile.</b>  If you're
using 1.8.8 or earlier, you can follow <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org/pipermail/gentoo-announce/2002-May/000162.html">these instructions</uri> to upgrade to the latest version of Portage.</p>
