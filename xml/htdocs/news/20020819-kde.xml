	<title>Gentoo Linux KDE 3.0.3 ebuilds</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>Dan Armak, our KDE developer writes:</b> "I've committed ebuilds for KDE 3.0.3. It's a bugfix release which will replace
your installed KDE 3.0.x. There's also kdevelop-2.1.3, a bugfix release that 
comes with kde 3.0.3. kde-i18n ebuilds will follow in a few hours." From the <uri link="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.0.3.html">official kde.org
announcement</uri>:</p>
<p>"KDE 3.0.3 contains an important fix for handling SSL certificates. Anyone who 
uses Konqueror for secure transactions on the Internet is strongly urged to 
upgrade. Users of Internet Explorer, which suffers from the same problem but 
which does not yet have a fix available, are also encouraged to switch to KDE 
3.0.3." Since kde.org appears to be in an encouraging mood, you're hereby 
encouraged to run KDE 3.0.3 on Gentoo Linux. Not like you needed any encouragement ;)</p>
