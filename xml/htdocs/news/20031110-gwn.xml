<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20031110-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri>, you'll read about the managers' meeting that occurred last Monday, where the fact that project status reports weren't being released to most devs and users, as well as the future of Portage, were discussed.</b>  Also in this issue: the return of Gentoo Security, a profile of Sven Mermeulen, community coverage, and a tip on using aspell to check spelling.  Enjoy!
