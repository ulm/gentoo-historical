<b>Gentoo is proud to present the world with Gentoo Linux 2004.3!</b>
</p>
<p>
This is the final release of 2004 and is the culmination of the work of
each of our developers.  The main focus for this release was fixing bugs
in previous releases and making the release tools more robust and easier
to use.  Releasing for 2004.3 are amd64, hppa, ppc, sparc, x86 and also
our initial ppc64 release.  There is also an experimental alpha release,
along with stages for ia64 and s390.  The embedded team has also
released stages for arm, mips, ppc, and x86, all which can be found
under /experimental. You can find out more about 2004.3 by checking out

reading the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/release/2004.3/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</uri>.</p>
<p> Some points of interest include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>amd64 and ppc switching to gcc 3.4 as their compiler of choice</li>
	<li>sparc releasing only sparc64 media</li>
	<li>amd64 and x86 switching to a single kernel for the LiveCD</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved improved developer communication between the vaious arch teams for a more consistent release was also a point of interest, 
including the completion of switching Gentoo to using the new cascading profiles. </p>

<p>The Release Engineering project would like to thank all of the Gentoo
developers and our many community testers for making this release our
best ever and we're all looking forward to bringing you an awesome
2005.0!</p>
