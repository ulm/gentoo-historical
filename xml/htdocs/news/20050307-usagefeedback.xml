<title>Gentoo Usage</title>

<body>

<p>
One of the things that we are always looking for at Gentoo is
information on people using Gentoo to make their lives easier.  This
could be anything from using Gentoo machines as a render farm or rolled
out into desktop usage, to just a small corporate firewall.  Information
such as this can help us better determine where we are and where we
should be focusing our efforts.  If you have a Gentoo success story,
then we would love to hear about it!  Information about large
deployments or Gentoo usage in unusual markets are mostly what we are
looking to receive.  Send your story to <mail>usage-feedback@gentoo.org</mail>
today.
