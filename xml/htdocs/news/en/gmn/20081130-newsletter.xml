<title>This month in the GMN</title>
<body>

<p>
Welcome to the November issue of the Gentoo monthly newsletter!
</p>

<p>
This issue is bigger than usual, as there was no October issue. Your editors
were out of the country, attending conferences, moving, and dealing with massive
hardware failure. However, things are hopefully back to normal. Lots of stuff in
this issue!
</p>

<p>
As usual, you can discuss any aspect of this issue of the GMN in the
corresponding <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-5296808.html">
forum thread</uri>. We look forward to hearing from you!

<title>Council voting</title>
<body>

<p>
As announced on the <uri
link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_489c2faa212f1954dee0336458c8d3ae.xml">mailing
list</uri>, nominations were held for a single spot on the <uri
link="/proj/en/council">Gentoo Council</uri>. Developers have until December 5th
to vote. There were 11 nominees to the empty seat, of which 5 will run for this
election. Please see <uri
link="/proj/en/elections/council-200811-nominees.xml">this page</uri> for
details.

<title>Kernel team looking for help</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo's <uri link="/proj/en/kernel">kernel team</uri> is <uri
link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_25999dd92d75e0863d99947df9ad29cf.xml">looking
for volunteers</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Have an interest in kernel stuff, or the desire to become interested? Got time
and enthusiasm? Have basic <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Bugzilla</uri>
experience? Basic kernel compilation experience? The kernel team is looking for
YOU!
</p>

<p>
You don't need knowledge of the kernel's internal plumbing or years of kernel
hacking: if you have time, interest, and ask lots of questions, these things
will come anyway. Much of the work doesn't involve technical stuff; you don't
even need to be a Gentoo developer. It's a good opportunity to get involved with
development and later become a Gentoo developer, if you're interested.
</p>

<p>
The kernel is the heart of any Linux system, so it needs TLC. If you answered
anything even a <e>faint</e> "Yes" to the earlier questions, contact <mail
link="dsd"/>!

<title>New desktop environment: LXDE</title>
<body>

<p>
Looking for an extremely lightweight desktop environment? <mail link="yngwin"/>
has added <uri link="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</uri> to Portage. <uri
link="/proj/en/desktop/lxde/index.xml">LXDE</uri> is even lighter than <uri
link="http://www.xfce.org">Xfce</uri>, providing a variety of interchangeable
components. Just install <c>lxde-base/lxde-meta</c>.
</p>

<p>
Tantalized by the <uri
link="http://lxde.org/image_galleries/screenshots">screenshots</uri>? Want to
try it out? You should know that while some of the recommended components may be
marked stable (such as Openbox), the LXDE-specific packages are still marked
~arch, so you'll need to keyword them in <path>/etc/portage/package.keywords</path>.

<title>New Gentoo-based distribution: Incognito</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/">Incognito</uri> is a
Gentoo-based LiveCD and LiveUSB distribution designed for making secure,
anonymous internet usage easier and more accessible fo non-geeks. Incognito is
developed using <c>catalyst</c>, Gentoo's tool for creating releases.
</p>

<p>
Incognito comes with a web browser, IRC client, email client, instant messenger,
and other internet applications preconfigured with security in mind. This makes
it an operating system to use safely from home, work, university, internet cafés,
libraries, etc.
</p>

<p>
So how popular is it? A crude estimate by its developers list around 10,000 to
20,000 users, among them human rights activists from China, the Middle East, and
Africa.

<title>Gentoo Wiki Returns!</title>
<body>

<p>
Due to an unfortunate set of circumstances, the servers of the unofficial,
user-run site <uri link="http://gentoo-wiki.com">Gentoo Wiki</uri> went down at
the beginning of October and despite much effort by Mike Valstar (thrasher7),
the site's owner, it was not possible to recover the original content. After much
hard graft however, the site has returned and is now fully up and running, with
any registered user able to contribute. A regular, full, off-site backup system
is also now in place to make sure that if such circumstances come about, the
hard efforts of contributors will not be lost again.
</p>

<p>
Don't fear, however - most of the old wiki content was saved by the efforts of
Nick Stallman (Cheater512), who set about trawling Google Cache shortly after
the crash and set up a static copy of the old wiki at
<uri>http://gentoo-wiki.info</uri> - Contributors are invited to copy articles
across to the new wiki, make them look good and check for accuracy and freshness.
</p>

<p>
Contributors should make sure they read up on the style guidelines and templates
in the Help section as some of the templates have changed and the site aims to
give better guidance on how to write the perfect article.
</p>

<p>
There are now more language-specific wikis than ever, with <uri
link="http://cs.gentoo-wiki.com/">Czech</uri>, <uri
link="http://de.gentoo-wiki.com/">German</uri>, <uri
link="http://es.gentoo-wiki.com">Spanish</uri>, <uri
link="http://fi.gentoo-wiki.com/">Finnish</uri>, <uri
link="http://fr.gentoo-wiki.com/">French</uri>, <uri
link="http://nl.gentoo-wiki.com">Dutch</uri>, <uri
link="http://ru.gentoo-wiki.com/">Russian</uri> and <uri
link="http://tr.gentoo-wiki.com/">Turkish</uri> now officially supported.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo Wiki admins would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the
contributors so far, whose invaluable efforts have helped get the wiki back up
and running so quickly.
</p>

<note>
Editors' note: There has been some discussion on the <uri
link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_e89a58195dec505ea8119aa8f1deb06b.xml">gentoo-dev</uri>
and <uri

mailing lists on the feasibility of an "official" Gentoo wiki; that is, one
hosted on Gentoo infrastructure. Be sure to read the threads in their entirety
if you're interested.

<title>Using TODO lists with your shell</title>
<body>

<p>
Love the shell? Want to know what else you can do with it? This tip is for you!
</p>

<p>
An old issue of the GWN <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20041220-newsletter.xml#doc_chap7">featured
a tip</uri> on using <c>app-misc/devtodo</c>. It's great for creating TODO
lists, but what about keeping track of them?
</p>

<p>
If you set <c>PROMPT_COMMAND="todo"</c> in your environment, the TODO list of
the current directory (if there is one) will be displayed before every shell
prompt.
</p>

<p>
If you use <c>PROMPT_COMMAND="todo --global --global-database ~/TODO; todo"</c>
you will see your global TODO list followed by the current directory's TODO
list. This makes keeping track of your tasks much easier.

<title>Running commands on many machines revisited: screen and pdsh</title>
<body>

<p>
In our <uri link="/news/en/gmn/20080930-newsletter.xml">last issue</uri>, we
featured tips on running commands on multiple Gentoo machines. One of our astute
readers wrote in to tell us of another way of doing it: with
<c>app-misc/screen</c>. You use a separate window to <c>ssh</c> into each host,
then use screen's <c>at</c> command to send keystrokes to each screen. Below is
a sample screen script to accomplish the task.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample screen script">
#!/usr/bin/screen

<comment># Read the default user's config</comment>
source $HOME/.screenrc

<comment># connect to all hosts</comment>
screen ssh gentoo-box-1
screen ssh gentoo-box-2
screen ssh gentoo-box-3
screen ssh gentoo-box-4
screen ssh gentoo-box-5
screen ssh gentoo-box-6
screen ssh gentoo-box-7
screen ssh gentoo-box-8
screen ssh gentoo-box-9
screen ssh gentoo-box-10

<comment># Don't pause the display just to echo the command</comment>
<comment># we're running</comment>
msgwait 0

<comment># The 'at' command takes the name of a window as the 1st arg,</comment>
<comment># and a GNU Screen command as the 2nd arg.</comment>
<comment># The 'stuff' command stuffs keys into the current window's</comment>
<comment># keyboard buffer. The ^M at the end is a carat followed by</comment>
<comment># an uppercase M; stuff translates that into a carriage return.</comment>
at ssh stuff "emerge --info^M"
</pre>

<p>
An alternative way to run commands is to install <c>app-shells/pdsh</c>, a
high-performance, parallel remote shell. Using <c>pdsh</c>, you can easily
customize the number of concurrent commands you can run, watch for output on the
command line for each machine at the same time, and limit the amount of time a
command can execute on the remote machines.
</p>

<p>
Here's how to run <c>date</c> on four machines named <b>gentoo-box-1</b>,
<b>gentoo-box-2</b>, and so on:
</p>

<pre caption="Running date on multiple machines">
# <i>pdsh -w $(echo gentoo-box-`seq -s ",gentoo-box-" 4`) "date"</i>

gentoo-box-1: Fri Oct 17 23:17:51 PDT 2008
gentoo-box-3: Fri Oct 17 23:17:51 PDT 2008
gentoo-box-2: Fri Oct 17 23:17:51 PDT 2008
gentoo-box-4: Fri Oct 17 23:17:51 PDT 2008
</pre>

<p>
Notice that each set of output is preceded by the host from which it came. You
can turn this feature off by using the <c>-N</c> option with <c>pdsh</c>.
</p>

<p>
One problem with <c>pdsh</c> is that you cannot pump input to the commands you
run. This means that you will not be able to input passwords interactively using
<c>pdsh</c>. You need to have public key encryption setup or have <c>askpass</c>
configured correctly along with X forwarding. For more information read the man
page for <c>ssh</c> under SSH_ASKPASS also read the <c>pdsh</c> man page under
Limitations.
</p>

<p>
That's it for this issue's Tips and Tricks. Thanks to all the readers who wrote
in with their ideas for managing multiple machines!
