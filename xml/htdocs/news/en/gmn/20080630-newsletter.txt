3. Gentoo International
=======================

Germany: LinuxTag 2008
----------------------

With more than 11,000 visitors, LinuxTag[8] in Berlin is by far the most
important Linux and Open Source Software show in Europe. As in earlier years,
Gentoo was again present at the expo after we missed the last two LinuxTag
expos taking place in Wiesbaden 2006 and Berlin 2007. This year about 10
developers and other Gentoo enthusiasts (including users from the German
support channel, #gentoo-anfaenger) helped man the booth. Even some phpBB
developers showed up.

(rbu), acm, sebastian, appro
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gmn/20080630/group.png

This year the booth was set up to convey information to the audience, instead
of showing hardware as in the years before. Nevertheless, the booth was
populated with enough (Apple) laptop computers to open a little shop. One
iBook was set up to display an automated installation process of Gentoo
Linux[9]. Some visitors even asked where we were hiding that guy who was
entering the commands so fast. :)

Powered by Larry the Cow (one tagged "OpenSSL") the team managed to survive
through the days, with the help of the popular drink "Club Mate." Friendly
meet-ups with Debian and Ubuntu people did not escalate at all, and there was
even cooperation during the event. Sun engineers demoing OpenSolaris at their
stand were happy to give hints how to resolve a compilation issue that popped
up during the port of Gentoo Prefix to OpenSolaris.

Gentoo participated in the Hacking Contest held at the event and was
represented by genstef[10] and two of our users, in an attempt to hold up
Gentoo's reputation. The Gentoo team eventually won the second prize, a
Nintendo DS.

On the last evening, the Ubuntu people organised a friendly barbecue party
for everyone. The beer was free as in beer, and the meat "open source." The
barbecue was held at C-base[11], Ubuntu's ~@Berlin, which from the inside is
an exciting space station with many man-hours invested in weird decorations
and programs like essential alien rootkit checkers.

Venezuela: FliSoL 2008
----------------------

On Saturday April 26th, FLISoL 2008[12], Latin America's largest Free
Software promotional and installfest ended, having taken place more or less
simultaneously throughout Latin America. In Venezuela, it was hosted in the
capital city Caracas and other cities such as Barquisimeto, Cumaná, Los
Teques, Maracaibo, Mérida, San Cristóbal and Valencia.

  12. http://www.installfest.info/FLISOL2008

As well as being a free-for-all, catch-as-catch-can multiple distro
installfest and promotion event, it also featured interesting talks on a wide
variety of subjects, including clusters, web development frameworks,
security, VOIP and the Gimp, among others.

In Caracas, the event was hosted at the ISEIT[13], where a small group of
enthusiastic Gentoo users and devs, amongst which were angvp, alberkmann,
neurogeek, sebasmagri, Ricardo Mendoza[14] and John Christian Stoddart[15],
gathered to expound upon the multiple virtues of everyone's favourite
meta-distro to all comers, live as well as on irc (#gentoo-ve on
irc.freenode.net), while at the same time racing to complete installs on wide
variety of machines, troubleshooting hardware, handing out Gentoo minimal
install and LiveCDs right, left and centre and even having time to
demonstrate Frets on Fire on Gentoo. A few Gentoo lappies sported highly
tweaked e17 desktops, laden with eye candy that caught everyone's attention.

In Mérida, Gentoo LiveCDs were hot items too, as was the demonstration of
games running on Gentoo. Many Gentoo enthusiasts were also reported at the
Maracaibo event.

Interview: Google Summer of Code Student Nirbheek Chauhan
---------------------------------------------------------

In the second of the series of interviews with our Summer of Code students,
we chat with Nirbheek Chauhan[16], who is working on "AutotuA". Find out more
about him and the project by reading on!

  16. nirbheek.chauhan@gmail.com

GMN: Give us a brief introduction of yourself. Where are you from? Where and
what do you study? What's your homepage or other means for fans to stalk you?

Nirbheek: Hello! I'm Nirbheek Chauhan (bheekling). I don't exactly "belong"
to any single place (Dad's in the Army), although I was born in Chandigarh,
India. I'm currently in my 3rd year of B.Tech doing Civil Engineering at IIT
Kanpur. Fans and freaks are welcome to my blog[17] -- comments are open and
free for all. ^_^

  17. http://bheekly.blogspot.com

GMN: Were you already involved with Gentoo and/or open source in general
before acceptance into SoC? If yes, briefly tell us how you got involved and
why you like writing open source code.

Nirbheek: I had been using Ubuntu as my full-time OS for a year before I
shifted to Gentoo after Arun Raghavan (Ford_Prefect) nagged me to try it out
for the N+1th time. The first Open Source project that I contributed code to
was the Beagle Project[18] where I hacked on the experimental Beagle
Webinterface[19] under the wonderful guidance of Debajyoti Bera (dBera).

  18. http://beagle-project.org/
  19. http://beagle-project.org/Beagle_Webinterface

I love Open Source (and specifically Gentoo) because it allows me to fix
whatever problems I face on my own. There is documentation for almost
everything out there, and where it doesn't exist, the code is always there.
Gentoo makes all this particularly easy since I just need to dump a patch in
${FILESDIR}, add a line to the ebuild, and voila! I can have the package
cleanly installed on my system with the fixes. The flexibility I get from
this far outweighs the compile time for everything (although I would really
love it if a safe and working hybrid binary-source system were devised)

GMN: How has your experience with the Gentoo community been so far?

Nirbheek: I have found the developers, especially the GNOME Herd, the Mozilla
Herd, Infra, Bug wranglers, and the previous Council Members, to be extremely
helpful, active, responsive, and sometimes terrifyingly efficient. All the
people whom I see actively working on Gentoo are simply a pleasure to talk
and work with. However, as is with most projects of such a size, there are a
few elements who seem to be spreading more chaos than actual contribution.

GMN: Please tell our readers a little about the project you're working on,
and why you think it will be helpful to Gentoo users. What was your
inspiration for starting the project? What do you expect to achieve with it?

Nirbheek: The project was originally called (for lack of imagination)
"Automate it All"[20] (*with* quotes). With the advent of further lack of
imagination on Eric's[21] part, it was christened AutotuA[22]. The aim of the
project is to reduce the workload of Gentoo developers, make it easier for
users to help developers in testing, and increase the overall QA of the
packages and ebuilds in the portage tree by making it easier for developers
to test (and coordinate testing of) changes made to the tree.

  20. http://code.google.com/soc/2008/gentoo/appinfo.html?csaid=4718E0E515B5040C
  21. http://soc.gentooexperimental.org/account/show/6
  22. http://soc.gentooexperimental.org/projects/show/autotua

The basic design consists of a master-server and numerous slaves. The master
does bookkeeping of jobs, hosts the various resources, preserves state, and
manages distribution among the slaves. The slaves run jobs according to sets
of instructions called "jobuilds" which are similar in spirit (and syntax) to
ebuilds, but are used to describe the smallest "quantum of work". The
(lengthy) details of how they all will work can be found in my first weekly
report[23].

  23. http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-soc/msg_7b8cf5c6033d78f8afb3d5919b81560b.xml

My inspiration stemmed from frustration at having to do repetitive and easily
automatable tasks while testing packages. The last straw was testing
xulrunner-1.9 (a dependency of Firefox 3) for breakages with packages using
xulrunner (bug 213296[24]). The work was completely monotonous and
time-consuming -- perfect grounds for automation. I could've scripted the
work, but that would be a one-off thing and no one else would be able to make
use of it anyway.

  24. https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213296

I told Patrick Lauer (one of my mentors) about this and my proposed solution
for it. He suggested that I apply for a SoC project for the same to make sure
I actually finish it. ;) He then managed to get Stephen Klimaszewski[25]
interested and onboard for mentoring me, and voila! Here we are. :)

  25. steev@gentoo.org

<overzealous>I expect my project to cause a revolution in the way Gentoo
works.</overzealous>

GMN: What do you do when you're not coding? (hobbies, interests, favorite
T.V. shows etc.)

Nirbheek: Wait, what?! Coding *is* my hobby!

But when I get tired of coding, I usually read books or (online) manga, do
some photography (little experience however), watch Anime or Sci-Fi, write
random stuff, or play the occasional computer game (Half-Life 2 ftw!).

Of course, this is all usually done with Nine Inch Nails, Feist, toe, Pearl
Jam, R.E.M or Radiohead playing in the background. =)

GMN: Thanks for your time, and wish you all the best for the summer!

Gentoo Linux Headed for Space!
------------------------------

This article was written by Gentoo developer Joe Peterson[26], who works for
the Southwest Research Institute[27]. Joe already uses Gentoo Linux for
projects such as the New Horizons[28] space operations center. Now, he'll
take Gentoo where no penguin has gone before . . .

Gentoo is getting ready to fly into space aboard a rocket called the Rapid
Acquisition Imaging Spectrograph Experiment (RAISE). The rocket is part of
NASA's "sounding rocket program", and it is a relatively inexpensive way to
gather information about the Sun from light that cannot penetrate the Earth's
atmosphere. Southwest Research Institute, where RAISE is being designed, has
a very active solar research group that is on the cutting edge of new
discoveries about our closest star.

One of the main mysteries that RAISE will help to solve involves the
temperature of the solar corona. This outer atmosphere of the Sun is more
than one million degrees centigrade, whereas the Sun's surface is a mere 6000
degrees. Because the data to be collected by RAISE will give insight into the
mechanisms of energy conversion in the solar atmosphere, we hope to use this
data to better understand this strange temperature inversion.

RAISE will fly to an altitude of 350 km—well into space—and then return to
Earth via parachute. The total flight time will be about 14 minutes, giving
the rocket 6 minutes of "hang time" in space to collect data. Two ultraviolet
detectors will collect stereo images and 3D spectral/spacial "cubes" of data.
In the latter case, a mirror and slit will be used to scan across the Sun and
collect a UV spectrum at each pixel.

Figure 4.1: Capture board running Gentoo Linux
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gmn/20080630/board.png

Gentoo Linux will be used on four processor boards in the flight electronics.
One will be the central controller, and the other three will be dedicated to
capturing data from the instruments. Spectral "image" data will be collected
at 10Hz and stored on a solid-state PATA drive, which will be retrieved from
the rocket after landing. A minimal Gentoo installation will be included on
each board for flight. On the capture boards, we will add USB drivers for
instrument I/O. In fact, we have our first capture board up and running
already, and data is successfully coming in from our test camera in the lab.

So stay tuned for further news about RAISE, and when it launches, remember
that all of the Gentoo Project's hard work went into making this rocket's
operating system flight-ready!

5. Tips and Tricks
==================

Measuring and reducing power usage
----------------------------------

For those who want to reduce energy use, increase their laptop time on
battery, and those who simply want to save money, this edition of Tips and
Tricks is for you. Let's use PowerTop[50] to reduce the amount of power your
computer draws.

  50. http://www.linuxpowertop.org/

The first step is to install PowerTop and run it:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 5.1                                                           |
| Using powertop                                                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # emerge powertop                                                          |
| # powertop                                                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

PowerTop will likely tell you that you need a few options enabled in your
kernel, if they aren't enabled already.

To prepare your kernel for PowerTop you need to go into "Processor type and
features". Set "Tickless System" to be built into the kernel. If you do not
have this option you can continue without setting it. Next, go to the main
menu and go into "Kernel hacking". Set "Kernel debugging" to be built in,
then select "Collect kernel timer statistics". If you are doing this on a
laptop, enable battery support in "Power management options" and "ACPI
Support". Finally, enable "CPU frequency translation statistics" under "Power
management options" and "CPU Frequency scaling".

Reboot into your reconfigured kernel and run powertop again. You should see a
list of applications are kernel components "waking the system up". All you
need to know is that fewer wakeups means your system consumes less power.
PowerTop gives you a few tips at the bottom.

The first one is to tell the kernel to disable USB until you need it. This
option is under "Device Drivers", in "USB Support". It is probably called
"USB selective suspend/resume and wakeup".

The second one is to increase the dirty write back interval to 15 seconds --
or an interval of your choosing). This will help reduce disk wakeups.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 5.2                                                           |
| Reducing disk wakeups                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # echo 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs                       |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

There are other things you can do to reduce you power usage. For example, if
you happen to browse many CPU-intensive Flash sites, you can install the
FlashBlock[51] add-on for Firefox and choose to view Flash upon your request
only.
