This month in the GMN
---------------------

Welcome to the second issue of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter. To begin with,
we would like to thank the entire community for the overwhelming response to
the GMN's inaugural issue. We received a lot of encouraging feedback and hope
that you will continue to write in. Remember, the GMN is what its readers
want it to be - please see the section on how you can get involved - at the
end of the newsletter for more information.

This month's issue implements some of the interesting suggestions we received
from our readers. The security statistics have been removed, since it seemed
to add a lot of clutter with little value-addition to the newsletter. You can
still monitor GLSAs in a variety of ways though - by using glsa-check (part
of gentoolkit[1]), by subscribing to the feed on the GLSA page[2] or the
gentoo-announcemailing list[3].

Graphical bugzilla and package statistics is another feature we implemented,
don't forget to see the cool graphs and charts! In tune with the feature on
our front page announcements, you can now discuss particular issues of the
Gentoo Monthly Newsletter in the forum. Discuss this newsletter[4]!

Gentoo Trustee Elections
------------------------

The Gentoo Trustee elections are currently in progress. After nearly a month
of nominations, we are left with 8 candidates for the posts. The polls will
be open until February 28. Everybody who has ever voted in a trustee election
or has been a Gentoo developer for the last 365 days (or more, from the date
of close of election poll) is eligible to vote. You can get more information
on the election and on each candidate's manifesto on the trustee election
page[5].

Kernel security exploits: Upgrade ASAP
--------------------------------------

Two major security flaws in the Linux kernel were reported last weekend. Both
flaws have the same impact (root access for local users) and both exist
within the vmsplice() system call, which was added to the kernel in 2.6.17.
There is no configuration option to exclude vmsplice() so everyone is
vulnerable.

One of the security issues existed for the entire lifetime of vmsplice(), so
any kernel version from 2.6.17 onwards is vulnerable. This was fixed in
2.6.24.2, 2.6.23.16 and 2.6.22.18. It has been assigned the vulnerability
identifier of CVE-2008-0600[6].

   6. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0600

The other security issue first appeared in 2.6.23. It was fixed in 2.6.23.15
and 2.6.24.1. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2008-0009[7] and
CVE-2008-0010[8].

   7. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0009
   8. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0010

gentoo-sources-2.6.23-r8 and gentoo-sources-2.6.24-r2 were added to the tree
Monday and include fixes for both issues. Install the latest
gentoo-sources[9] as quickly as possible.

KDE 4.0.1 in the tree
---------------------

Gentoo's KDE herd is happy to inform you that they've just committed KDE
4.0.1 to the Portage tree.

KDE 4.0.1 is the first maintenance release and fixes many issues of the
initial release. Among those changes are stability bugfixes and performance
improvements for Konqueror[11] and its Flash integration as well as its
JavaScript support. KWin[12] has seen improvements with respect to
compositing and error handling. Almost all other KDE modules have been worked
on extensively as well.

Council Meeting Summary
-----------------------

The Gentoo Council[14] held its monthly meeting on 14 February, 2008. The
items put up for discussion were:

  14. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/

  * GLEP 46[15] (Allow upstream tags in metadata.xml): This GLEP was
    approved, however the proposer is required to explain why the protocols
    that may be used were restricted to HTTP and HTTPS only - before the GLEP
    is finalized.
  * EAPI=1 (Where is the specification?): The general agreement was that
    any new EAPIs should not be added until EAPI=0 is fully approved.
    However, there wasn't any consensus on changing anything about EAPI=1.
    Mark Loeser[16] agreed to work on PMS for EAPI=0, and will provide an
    update at the next meeting.

  15. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0046.html
  16. halcy0n@gentoo.org

Some items were rolled over from the previous meeting. GLEPs 54[17] and
55[18] were not resubmitted to the council for discussion.

  17. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0054.html
  18. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0055.html

  * Code of Conduct Enforcement: Donnie Berkholz[19] posted a simple
    suggestion on the council mailing list. The council supported the
    implementation and Donnie will get things going.
  * Document of being an active developer: No updates.
  * Slacker archs: No updates.

Coming Up
---------

  * FOSDEM[20]: February 23-24. One of the best community events of
    Europe. Although there isn't going to be an official Gentoo presence at
    the event, you can look forward to meeting several Gentoo developers and
    users at the event.
  * Bugday[21]: Looking for a way to help out Gentoo without investing a
    lot of time? Join us on March 01 for our monthly bugday, and help us
    squash some bugs[22].
  * Chemnitzer Linux-Tage[23]: March 01-02. Several European Gentoo
    developers and users are planning[23] to attend, so if you're going to be
    around Chemnitz at the time, do drop in!
  * Council Meeting[14]: The Gentoo Council meets every month to discuss
    important technical issues that affect Gentoo as a whole. This month's
    meeting is scheduled to be held on March 13, and everyone is welcome to
    participate - #gentoo-council on irc.freenode.net at 2000UTC.
  * PyCon[24]: March 13-17. There's a Birds Of a Feather (BoF) session
    planned for everyone interested in Gentoo at the conference. If you're
    interested, don't forget to drop a note in the forums[25].

3. Heard in the Community
=========================

The Emacs Team
--------------

Introduction:

Some people wonder how maintaining a bunch of packages works in Gentoo and
how they can help as users. Every team has its own style of work-flow but
some common schemes are present in every team. This month, we take a look at
how the Emacs[26] team functions.

  26. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/lisp/emacs/

Who we are and what we do:

The Emacs team consists of two developers, Ulrich Müller[27] and Christian
Faulhammer[28], who take care of all packages in the app-emacs category[29]
besides the GNU Emacs editor and several micro Emacsen. Additionally, we
often take care of Emacs support (mostly enabled by USE=emacs) for packages
maintained by other teams.

  27. ulm@gentoo.org
  28. fauli@gentoo.org
  29. http://packages.gentoo.org/category/app-emacs

How we work:

There are two ways of working: Act or react. Reaction happens on user
requests that come in by bug reports (the preferred way), IRC or by e-mail.
Acting happens in mail exchange or discussion on IRC of the team members. We
discuss problems we have had or ones that might occur and try to find optimum
solutions to them. Optimal in this case means leaving as few people as
possible with problems. This often means a trade-off between features and
backwards compatibility.

Bug reports are handled by any of the members. Whoever reacts first is
responsible for the bug, unless someone else has a superior solution. New
packages that are experimental are first tried out in the Emacs overlay[30],
which is connected to a Wiki system where we store temporary information and
progress reports. For example, we collect information about packages that
have broken or bad Emacs support in the Wiki. Whenever one of us finds time,
the problem is fixed and the entry deleted from the Wiki. Alternatively, if
the problem could not be fixed, additional information is added to the entry
so the next person can start off where this one left. The Wiki also stores
information like which packages need a newer version/revision in the tree
(including a target date) and test plans for many packages.

  30. http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/emacs/

Stabilization is handled through the bug tracker[31]. A maintainer files a
new bug which says "stable app-emacs/xyz-1.0" in the summary and has all
relevant architecture teams (such as x86, amd or sparc) in the CC field. The
architecture team then tests the package (with the help of the collected test
plans) and marks it stable.

  31. http://bugs.gentoo.org/

How users can help:

The easiest way to help is to file a bug report if you spot a problem. Even
minor ones are important for overall quality, such as if there is a new
version of a program/package that could not to be found in Portage. Please
give maintainers at-least a few days time after release though! If you are
not sure about a problem, try to investigate a bit. Don't be afraid of your
request being called "dumb", we actually prefer bugs that can be closed as
INVALID (or something similar) as compared to real issues that may not be
reported at all. Be sure to check for duplicate bugs beforehand!

Users are welcome to join our IRC channel #gentoo-lisp on Freenode[32] where
you can get support for all flavours of Lisp (including Emacs Lisp). IRC is a
great way to directly contact developers. Email[33] is a good communication
channel too, but not perfect, as emails may get lost. Emails are also
forgotten more easily than bug reports.

  32. http://freenode.net/
  33. emacs@gentoo.org

Working on the overlay is another way to contribute, but we won't give away
commit access too easily as a simple change is potential for a lot of harm.
Trusted users do gain commit access after proving themselves. Some hints on
how GNU Emacs on Gentoo works can be found in the maintainers guide[34].

Gentoo tops BIND benchmarks
---------------------------

The Internet Systems Consortium[35] conducted a benchmark to test various
operating systems for their suitability to run BIND 9[36]. Amongst all the
operating systems tested, Gentoo Linux running on kernel version 2.6.20.7
topped the charts, processing 93,000 queries per second! Fedora Core came
second with 87,000 queries/second, followed by FreeBSD-7 (84,000
queries/second).

Want to organize your command line screen session or sessions better? Want to
have a separate screen session for every task that you do? Want something
that will organize you in general? This GMN has the perfect tip for you. It
is a tiny script called screenie.

You now have two screen sessions that you can go into and out of. Select one
of the sessions. You are now inside of screen where you can do whatever you
usually do.

Note: See the tips and tricks[63] describing screen.

  63. http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030714-newsletter.xml#doc_chap9

To go to another screen session, press CTRL+a+d (or however you usually exit
your screen sessions). You should be back to the screenie menu and ready to
choose to go to another screen session.

One use of screenie might be to have a screen session for every task and for
every machine you have access to making multi-tasking much more organized.
This should also make it much easier to start working again after a long
break.

Figure 6.1: Package distribution by keyword
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gmn/20080218/keywords.png

The following section lists packages that have either been moved or added to
the tree and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to
be removed in the future. The package removals come from many locations,
including the Treecleaners[64] and various developers. Most packages which
are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love and care and
can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
