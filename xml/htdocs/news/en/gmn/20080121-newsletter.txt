1. Introduction
===============

This month in the GMN
---------------------

You are reading the inaugural issue of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter (GMN).
The GMN replaces the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter, and hopes to bring you more
consistent, high-quality articles on happenings in and around the Gentoo
Community. The format of the GMN will remain more or less the same as the
older weekly newsletter, but we are actively seeking volunteers with more
ideas on how to improve the content and presentation. The GMN is what its
readers want it to be - please see the section on how you can get involved -
at the end of the newsletter for more information.

We hope you enjoy reading the GMN, and look forward to receiving your
feedback!

Council Meeting Summary
-----------------------

The Gentoo Council[1] held its monthly meeting on January 10, 2008. The
items put up for discussion were:

   1. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/

  * GLEP 54[2]: Portage maintainers were concerned that the GLEP didn't
    have any information on compatibility and implementation plans. A couple
    of other ideas that came up during discussion were to use '-scm' as a
    suffix, handle '-9999' versions per definition, or implement them as
    dynamic package sets. As there were too many unresolved questions, this
    item was postponed to the development mailing list for further
    discussion.
  * GLEP 55[3]: The council reached the conclusion that agreement on
    EAPI subdirectories was not feasible. The council postponed the item for
    further discussion on the development mailing list, as too many
    questions remained unresolved.
  * Enforcement of the Code of Conduct (CoC): Council members agreed on
    the general direction that the CoC was taking. [4] was appointed the
    task of providing additional details to the council mailing list[5].
  * Dealing with "Slacker Archs": [6] was appointed the task of working
    on [7]'s suggestion[8] to resolve the issue.
  * Providing developers with an "official" statement of being an active
    developer: The option of automatically generating the document was
    proposed. [4] and [9] were appointed the task of creating a scribus[10]
    based template for the same.

Foundation Status
-----------------

[13], one of our active foundation trustees, recently gave an update on the
status of the Gentoo foundation on his blog. The Gentoo Foundation does
still exist, and the required paperwork to reinstate our NFP status has been
filed. For more information, you can read Grant's post[14] on the gentoo-nfp
mailing list[5].

KDE 4 in Gentoo
---------------

Everyone's talking about KDE 4, which was released on 11th January after
years of development. The latest version of KDE is available in Gentoo for
those bold enough to try it - and the KDE herd have released an upgrade
guide[17] to help you ease the transition.

Improvements in ATI TV-Out
--------------------------

In one of the previous newsletter issues we reported about changes in nVidia
driver packages. This time around, let's take a look at the state of ATI
driver packages. ATI card owners will be pleased to know that there have
been improvements to ATI's Open Source and proprietary video drivers
recently.

[18] announced recently in his blog[19] that support for TV-out had been
merged into the official xorg-ati driver. Thanks to his efforts in
relicensing the GATOS project code under the MIT license (which is used by
xorg); TV-out support will find its way into one of the next releases of
xf86-video-ati[20]. The code should work on most R200 and R300-based cards
and is part of the new randr-1.2-branch. randr 1.2 is a new X technology
that allows much better control of resolutions and output connectors.

  20. http://packages.gentoo.org/package/x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati

Until now, owners of newer ATI hardware were in a better situation; as the
official fglrx[21] driver had support for TV-out. Even though it might have
been difficult to utilize the functionality, users at least had the option.
With the recent driver release, however, phoronix[22] reports that TV-out
support in the fglrx driver has not only been improved - it will also be
much easier to configure it, thanks to the transition to the catalyst
control center interface.

Reaction on Daniel Robbins' offer

Several developers commented on the offer of Daniel Robbins[35] and the
following news on several sites. Daniel offered to "return and serve as
President of the Gentoo Foundation, renew its charter, and then work in some
capacity to help to get Gentoo going in the right direction from a legal,
community and technical perspective". Here's what some of our developers had
to say about it:

This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be
removed in the future. The package removals come from many locations,
including the Treecleaners[79] and various developers. Most packages which
are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love and care
and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
