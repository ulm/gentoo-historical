<title>Council Meeting Summary</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/">Gentoo Council</uri> held
its monthly meeting on May 8, 2008. The items put up for discussion were:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
   <b>Active-developer document</b>: We reviewed it and made some suggestions
   for improving both the document and the online developer list (adding
   dates).
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>ChangeLog entries</b>: Always required. If you aren't making them now, fix
   your script to call <c>echangelog</c>.
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>Ignored arch-team bugs</b>: What's the workflow for undermanned arch
   teams?  Can we improve it?
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>8-digit versions</b>: Ask package maintainers with extremely long PVs
   whether they were needed and test the impact of extending
   <path>versionator.eclass</path>.  Make decision once this data is available.
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>Enforced retirement</b>: After 2.5 hours on the previous topics, people
   had to go to sleep and <mail link="jokey@gentoo.org">jokey</mail>'s computer
   broke. Instead of waiting till the next regular meeting, because of its
   urgency, we scheduled a special session next week at the same time. The
   appeals will *not* be decided then -- it's about figuring out the validity
   and the process.
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>New meeting process</b>: 105 minutes were closed and 57 were open. It
   might save some time if we always moderated, but it won't cut it in half.
   Should we keep doing this, or modify it a little to have a moderated
   #gentoo-council and open backchannel?

 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Some items were rolled over from the previous meeting:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
   <b>Document of being an active developer</b>: <mail
   link="araujo@gentoo.org">araujo</mail> made
   <uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~araujo/gcert1.pdf</uri> in Scribus. He'd like to
   ask for aproval of this design and discuss the script, in particular of its
   infrastructure requirements.
 </li>
 <li><b>Slacker arches</b>: No updates</li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>

<!--- Coming up -->

<title>Coming Up</title>
<body>

<ul>
 <li>
   <b><uri link="http://www.linuxtag.org/2008/">LinuxTag Berlin</uri></b>: The
   biggest European Linux event is on again. On the Berlin Fairgrounds, Gentoo
   will be featured again. Join developers and users on the booth between
   <b>May 28 and 31</b>, we hope it'll be as much fun as Chemnitz was!

<title>Porthole 0.6.0 nearing release</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://porthole.sourceforge.net/">Porthole</uri> is a gtk+ Portage
tree browser and front-end. It strives to put the most important and
useful information there for you to learn about a package before deciding to
upgrade or install it. It also provides the most commonly used emerge operations
with just a click or two. One of Porthole's greatest features is that information
is much quicker to find, especially if you do not know what you are looking for.
Porthole can search for (partial or complete) package names, as well as
searching package descriptions.
</p>

<p>
Porthole allows you to easily select and set USE flags, keywords, select
specific versions to emerge or unmerge, and toggle any of the emerge options off
or on. There is also a "Run Custom Command" option to send nearly any command to
Porthole's terminal. The terminal has configurable message filtering (since
before Portage implemented elog capabilities) and has a command queue that can
be paused and restarted.
</p>

<p>
New in porthole-0.6.0 is a saved description database that Porthole creates and
automatically updates when it sees that the Portage tree has been updated. This
provides for very fast description searches even on older slower hardware. The
results are browseable with just a mouse click.
</p>

<p>
Another new feature in porthole-0.6.0 is the ability to add "Sets" support to
existing Portage versions without waiting for <c>portage-2.2</c> or switching to
<c>pkgcore</c> or <c>paludis</c>. Sets let you easily create your own package
groups such as a custom Gnome set, a server set, etc.
</p>

<p>
Porthole is available in several languages, and its developers are looking for
volunteers to update the translations and add new languages. They would also
like additional arch testing. Follow its development on <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219968">Bugzilla</uri> and <uri

<title>Tips and Tricks</title>

<title>Command-line network monitoring</title>
<body>

<p>
Have you ever wanted facilities like top, but for your computer's network? This
tip shows you what options you have in command-line network monitors.
</p>

<p>
The first is <uri link="http://iptraf.seul.org/">IPTraf</uri>:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing IPTraf">
# <i>emerge iptraf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Using it is easy:
</p>

<pre caption="Using IPTraf">
$ <i>iptraf</i>
</pre>

<p>
It is a highly advanced <c>ncurses</c> interface. You can choose view your
network status from many angles: IP traffic by port and IP address, general
interface statistics such as number of packets passing through, speed and volume
of packets passing through, and much more.
</p>

<p>
Another network monitor is <c>vnstat</c>. This program is useful for historical
statistics. It keeps a database for your interfaces.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing vnstat">
# <i>emerge vnstat</i>
</pre>

<p>
It will need an hour to gather enough statistics. <c>vnstat</c> is installed
with a cron script (<path>/etc/cron.hourly/vnstat</path>) that updates
<c>vnstat</c>'s database every hour.  Once you have enough data in the database
you can get hourly, daily, and monthly data from <c>vnstat</c>. For example, to
see hourly statistics:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing hourly statistics">
$ <i>vnstat -h</i>
</pre>

<p>
A third program is <c>iftop</c>. <c>iftop</c> does for networking what
<c>top</c> does for CPU usage. It shows you which connections have the most
traffic going in and out. Install <c>iftop</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing iftop">
# <i>emerge iftop</i>
</pre>

<p>
Then run and use it just like top:
</p>

<pre caption="Running iftop">
$ <i>iftop</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can press <c>?</c> to view options that you can use.
