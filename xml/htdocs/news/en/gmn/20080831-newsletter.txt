PHP4 removed from the Portage tree
----------------------------------

All work on PHP4 was been discontinued by upstream on August 8. No more
security or bug fixes will be released. PHP4 has already been hardmasked in
the Portage tree since October 2007 (for security reasons), and now it has
finally been removed from the tree[2].

   2. http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_020e1b3a1d976d5028d9c329470a732e.xml

If possible, you should upgrade to PHP5, which is still supported with bug
and security fixes.

If you or your company have still not upgraded to PHP5, there is a PHP4
overlay available[3]. However, running these older PHP4 packages on publicly
accessible services is not recommended, as the packages still contain
multiple security vulnerabilities.

Interview: Google Summer of Code Student Nandeep Mali
-----------------------------------------------------

In the third of the series of interviews with our Summer of Code students, we
chat with Nandeep Mali[10], who is working on "Setting Beacon Afloat". Find
out more about him and the project by reading on!

  10. n9986.mali@gmail.com

GMN: Give us a brief introduction of yourself. Where are you from? Where and
what do you study? What's your homepage or other means for fans to stalk you?

Nandeep: Hi folks! :) I am from India and completed my undergraduate (B.Tech)
in Computer Engineering from NIT Jaipur this year in May. My homepage/blog
used to be at miniorb.in but now it's just an empty domain awaiting some
care. And one can always haunt me at my email or poking me at Freenode (alias
= n9986).

GMN: Were you already involved with Gentoo and/or open source in general
before acceptance into SoC? If yes, briefly tell us how you got involved and
why you like writing open source code.

Nandeep:This summer has been my first plunge into this addictive activity. :D

I have been really interested in this whole front-end-for-the-network (read
'The Web') concept and wanted to vent out my energy into something more
useful than looping around my localhost.

While searching for a nice project I came upon this interesting idea in
Gentoo project pages. Knowing Anant (gamer buddy), I discussed with him the
possibilities with Beacon. The helpful 'pong' by rane during the drafting
stages helped me get around the Gentoo community. It was an awesome moment to
see my project page show 'Application Accepted!'.

From then on I have come a long way, learning about Gentoo by hanging out
#gentoo-dev and the mailing lists.

GMN: How has your experience with the Gentoo community been so far?

Nandeep: It's been a pleasure to be in touch with such efficient and very
talented developers. The documentation is very well done and user
contribution is also very easy. Despite some rumors about Gentoo not being
fun loving I would say that people here are very good humored and
professionals.

GMN: Please tell our readers a little about the project you're working on,
and why you think it will be helpful to Gentoo users. What was your
inspiration for starting the project? What do you expect to achieve with it?

Nandeep: The project is a kick start on a sleeping project 'Beacon' (and yes,
we'll gladly accept the award for the best project name) which was created by
Anant Narayanan[11] in 2006 as his Summer of Code project. I am working on
reviving this tool to, as put by rane, bring Gentoo documentation team out of
the middle ages of online editing (vim and cvs). The code base was already
strong and helped me get a good head start.

  11. anant@gentoo.org

There are many possibilities with Beacon. The Rich text Editor will help save
a lot of time and once integrated with the Documentation site it'll help easy
wiki-like editing of the docs. The useful repodoc-web module which was
already in place and the collaborative editor (like Google Docs) should have
some interesting impacts on the way the Doc Team works.

In fact I typed out the answers to this interview in Beacon's Rich text
Editor and probably saved the GMN some time. ^_^

The basic design consists of a master-server and numerous slaves. The master
does bookkeeping of jobs, hosts the various resources, preserves state, and
manages distribution among the slaves. The slaves run jobs according to sets
of instructions called "jobuilds" which are similar in spirit (and syntax) to
ebuilds, but are used to describe the smallest "quantum of work". The
(lengthy) details of how they all will work can be found in my first weekly
report[12].

  12. http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-soc/msg_7b8cf5c6033d78f8afb3d5919b81560b.xml

GMN: What do you do when you're not coding? (hobbies, interests, favorite
T.V. shows etc.)

Nandeep: Anime, Gaming, Music that my ears fancy (anything based on the
mood), Tolkien fiction, Roald Dahl's twists and rampaging around on the web
looking for random stuff. TV is an alien concept. And of course I never
really thought of coding as work. :)

GMN: Thanks for your time!

Gentoo in the News
------------------

Gentoo was recently featured in the French edition of Linux Identity
Magazine[22]; several articles were contributed by Gentoo developers Olivier
Fisette[23] and Luis Francisco Araujo[24]. Some of the articles are even
available online[25] (in French).

Tigase: A Gentoo-based LiveCD
-----------------------------

Tigase[26] is a new Gentoo-based distribution. The project focuses on
developing XMPP (Jabber) server and web, AJAX based clients.

  26. http://www.tigase.org

The LiveCD contains the Tigase server, Drupal CMS and Dovecot IMAP4 server
pre-configured to work together as one system. All services use the same user
database for authentication. You can also post news on the example website
directly from your Jabber client and also you can receive notifications about
new comments and posts to your Jabber client. More details are available on
the download page[27]. The LiveCD demonstrates how Tigase's Jabber code can
be integrated with other systems.

  27. http://www.tigase.org/en/tigase-livecd-4-0-0

Even though the project's code is written in Java, the development platform
was always Gentoo Linux, and all the Tigase servers are based on the Gentoo
Linux. Selecting Gentoo for the LiveCD was a natural choice. It gives the
developers plenty of flexibility and control over installed elements and the
way they work with all installed programs. Additionally, the developers can
easily update all packages using Portage.

The LiveCD is a 32-bit environment to make sure it will work on as many
platforms as possible, but it was prepared and built on a 64-bit Gentoo
installation. Despite the architectural differences, building the LiveCD is
quite easy and smooth.

Tin Hat: A Hardened Gentoo-based LiveCD
---------------------------------------

Tin Hat[28] is a LiveCD based on Hardened Gentoo[29]. It aims to provide a
very secure, stable, fast desktop environment that lives purely in RAM. It
doesn't mount any filesystem from CD, but instead it is a huge disc image
(2.3GB) that loads into tmpfs at boot. Tin Hat can also be run from a USB key
for somewhat shorter boot times. Whether used from a CD or USB key, once Tin
Hat is running in memory it's quite speedy, as it never has to access its
boot media.

  28. http://opensource.dyc.edu/tinhat
  29. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/

Tin Hat[30] takes security quite seriously, even aiming for "zero information
loss" -- its developers have taken steps to ensure that data is secured even
if an attacker physically acquires the box. To protect against network/code
exploits, Tin Hat layers GRSEC, PAX, and other nifty tricks. More information
on Tin Hat's security, speed, and rationale may be found on its project
page[28].

  28. http://opensource.dyc.edu/tinhat
  30. http://freshmeat.net/projects/tinhat

Tin Hat makes it easy to roll your own version via templates; you can even
save a snapshot of a currently running Tin Hat system and use that as a base,
complete with customizations, additional files, etc.

4. Tips and Tricks
==================

Using lsof to find open files and directories
---------------------------------------------

Have you had problems deleting a file or unmounting a device even as the root
user? More likely than not, your file or the directory where your device is
mounted is simply being used by another user or application. This edition of
Tips and Tricks shows you how to find who and what may be using the file or
directory that you are having trouble with.

First install the lsof tool:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.1                                                           |
| Installing lsof                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # emerge lsof                                                              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

lsof lists the open files on the system. An open file can be a file that you
are editing, reading with another program, or a directory that you are
browsing. An example of how lsof can be used is to unmount a device that
refuses to be unmounted. Let's say Larry the Cow mounted a CD-ROM a few days
ago and now wants to unmount it. When he tries to unmount it, he gets the
following error:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.2                                                           |
| Unmounting a CD                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # umount /mnt/cdrom                                                        |
| umount: /mnt/cdrom: device is busy                                         |
| umount: /mnt/cdrom: device is busy                                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Something has /mnt/cdrom open. Since Larry does not remember what it can be,
he runs lsof to get the following:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.3                                                           |
| Using lsof                                                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # lsof | grep /mnt/cdrom                                                   |
| bash  6453   larry  cwd  DIR  7,0  2048  1856 /mnt/cdrom                   |
| su    15774  root   cwd  DIR  7,0  2048  1856 /mnt/cdrom                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The first two fields describe the process name and process ID, the third
field is the user who owns the process, the forth field is file descriptor,
followed by the type of file, device number, size of the file, node number,
and finally the filename. The file descriptor is the type of the file, in
this case it is cwd, or current working directory. This means that somewhere
the user larry has his shell's directory pointed to /mnt/cdrom. Since Larry
has too many shells open, he decides to narrow down which shell it might be:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.4                                                           |
| Examining shells                                                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # lsof -R | grep /mnt/temp                                                 |
| bash  6453   6437   larry  cwd  DIR  7,0  2048  1856 /mnt/cdrom            |
| su    15774  6453   root   cwd  DIR  7,0  2048  1856 /mnt/cdrom            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

An extra third field appears, which shows the parent process of bash and su.
As you can see, su is the child of bash. This likely means that Larry ran su
in the bash session that is keeping /mnt/cdrom busy. Next Larry finds the
parent of the bash process:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.5                                                                        |
| Finding a parent process                                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # ps aux | grep 6437                                                                    |
| larry  6437  0.0  0.7  38880 24628 ?  S  Aug09  9:00 konsole [kdeinit] -session 10be696 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Larry uses Konsole as his terminal program. Thus he knows that he must find
the bash session somewhere in one of his Konsole windows. Larry finds the
possible Konsole window by running pstree:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.6                                                           |
| Looking for Konsole                                                        |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # pstree 6437                                                              |
| konsole-+-bash---python---{python}                                         |
|         |-2*[bash]                                                         |
|         |-bash---su---bash---pstree                                        |
|         |-2*[bash---su---bash]                                             |
|         |-bash---su---bash---vi                                            |
|         |-bash---ssh                                                       |
|         `-bash---su---bash---man---sh---sh---less                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Using this information, Larry narrows down his guessing to four bash sessions
where he ran su. To make /mnt/cdrom not busy he simply exits out of his su
terminals and uses cd to get out of the /mnt/cdrom directory.

lsof can be used for different purposes. For example, you can use it to
monitor your network connections:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.7                                                                             |
| Monitoring network connections                                                               |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # lsof -i TCP:22                                                                             |
| COMMAND  PID   USER   FD  TYPE  DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME                                        |
| sshd    6094   root   3u  IPv4    9145      TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)                               |
| ssh     9962 andrey   3u  IPv4 3489405      TCP larry.cow:35467>larry.bull:ssh (ESTABLISHED) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Here we see the sshd service that listens for ssh connections and an outgoing
ssh session.

lsof also comes with some scripts in the /usr/share/lsof/scripts/ directory.
Most will be useful in your quest to better spy on your users.
