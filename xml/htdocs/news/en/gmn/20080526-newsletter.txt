Council Meeting Summary
-----------------------

The Gentoo Council[5] held its monthly meeting on May 8, 2008. The items put
up for discussion were:

   5. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/

  * Active-developer document: We reviewed it and made some suggestions
    for improving both the document and the online developer list (adding
    dates).
  * ChangeLog entries: Always required. If you aren't making them now,
    fix your script to call echangelog.
  * Ignored arch-team bugs: What's the workflow for undermanned arch
    teams? Can we improve it?
  * 8-digit versions: Ask package maintainers with extremely long PVs
    whether they were needed and test the impact of extending
    versionator.eclass. Make decision once this data is available.
  * Enforced retirement: After 2.5 hours on the previous topics, people
    had to go to sleep and jokey[6]'s computer broke. Instead of waiting till
    the next regular meeting, because of its urgency, we scheduled a special
    session next week at the same time. The appeals will *not* be decided
    then -- it's about figuring out the validity and the process.
  * New meeting process: 105 minutes were closed and 57 were open. It
    might save some time if we always moderated, but it won't cut it in half.
    Should we keep doing this, or modify it a little to have a moderated
    #gentoo-council and open backchannel?

   6. jokey@gentoo.org

Some items were rolled over from the previous meeting:

  * Document of being an active developer: araujo[7] made
    http://dev.gentoo.org/~araujo/gcert1.pdf in Scribus. He'd like to ask for
    approval of this design and discuss the script, in particular its
    infrastructure requirements.
  * Slacker arches: No updates

   7. araujo@gentoo.org

Coming Up
---------

  * LinuxTag Berlin[8]: The biggest European Linux event is on again. On
    the Berlin Fairgrounds, Gentoo will be featured again. Join developers
    and users on the booth between May 28 and 31, we hope it'll be as much
    fun as Chemnitz was!
  * Bugday[9]: Looking for a way to help out Gentoo without investing a
    lot of time? Join us on June 07 for our monthly bugday, and help us
    squash some bugs[10].
  * Council Meeting[5]: The Gentoo Council meets every month to discuss
    important technical issues that affect Gentoo as a whole. This month's
    meeting is scheduled to be held on June 12, and everyone is welcome to
    participate - #gentoo-council on irc.freenode.net at 2000UTC.
  * Trustees Meeting: There will be a trustees meeting on June 22 -
    #gentoo-trustees on irc.freenode.net at 1900 UTC. The agenda will be
    posted in the channel's topic closer to the meeting time. All are welcome
    to attend.

=========================

Interview: Google Summer of Code Student Eric Thibodeau
-------------------------------------------------------

GSOC has started, and GMN editor Anant Narayanan[11] has interviewed one of
Gentoo's students, Eric Thibodeau[12].

  11. anant@gentoo.org
  12. kyron@neuralbs.com

GMN: Give us a brief introduction of yourself. Where are you from? Where and
what do you study? What's your homepage or other means for fans to stalk you?

Eric: I am from Montréal, Québec (Canada) and have been studying at the École
de technologies supérieures (aka ETS) since 2000. I've completed a bachelor's
degree in Electrical Engineering (Information Technology profile) and was
offered to continue on with a masters in parallel processing and
Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm profiling which I am hoping/have to finish
this summer ;). I've given BASH labs and classes at that same University on
and off depending on my time availability (now why am I giving a lab this
summer is beyond me ;) ).

I use my personal wiki (http://wiki.neuralbs.com) mostly as a sandbox for
jotting down stuff I do with Gentoo. I am not a big fan of personal web pages
since they are outdated by definition and would require too much of my time.
The best way to reach me is usually by poking at me on Freenode where I lurk
around and pester the really smart people from
#gentoo-(cluster|science|server).

GMN: Were you already involved with Gentoo and/or open source in general
before acceptance into SoC? If yes, briefly tell us how you got involved and
why you like writing open source code.

Eric: I've been mostly involved with Gentoo as a sysadmin, user and a
preacher (of some sorts). Due to my studies, my involvement usually revolved
around creating ebuilds for packages that were missing from the tree (ie:
OpenMPI which I was really glad a real dev took over ;) ), reporting bugs and
sharing my experience/expertise surrounding parallel processing, NFS booted
Gentoo SSI (Single System Image) and High Performance Computing.

GMN: How has your experience with the Gentoo community been so far?

Eric: I can't really give an assessment of the Gentoo "community" since I've
been using Gentoo since 2002 and might be biased by my first impression which
was 1) excellent documentation, 2) The "raison d'être" of open-source and
Linux: software compiled and optimized specifically for your hardware and
finally 3) A very active community where anyone can easily contribute
(ebuilds are just text files).

GMN: Please tell our readers a little about the project you're working on,
and why you think it will be helpful to Gentoo users. What was your
inspiration for starting the project? What do you expect to achieve with it?

Eric: I'll be working on building a Gentoo LiveCD/DVD with a twist: it will
be used to create a Beowulf computation cluster "on the fly". I picked this
project up after seeing a request for such a CD on the gentoo-science mailing
list (it was actually "if there is someone crazy enough out there").

What prompted me to take on the project is the fact that I have rebuilt a
cluster a few years back by creating my own Gentoo SSI and cluster head node.
The process was long, frustrating, half-documented and mostly not completed
to my satisfaction due to lack of tool integration and poor reproducibility
of my setup. My primary goal is to make clustering under Gentoo more
accessible and faster to deploy rather than learning every bits and pieces
required to build such an infrastructure.

GMN: What do you do when you're not coding? (hobbies, interests, favorite
T.V. shows etc.)

Eric: Apart from coming up with excuses to stay in front of the computer to
"chat with this otherwise never accessible godlike dev" on IRC, I enjoy
taking care of my nine month old daughter, watching off-beat movies with my
girlfriend. Although it's been a while since I've had a chance to do so, I
usually help out in designing some eccentric clothing
(http://www.mekkreations.com) which tend to reuse computer parts (hard disks
are so cool!)

GMN: Thanks for your time, and wish you all the best for the Summer!

Porthole 0.6.0 nearing release
------------------------------

Porthole[13] is a gtk+ Portage tree browser and front-end. It strives to put
the most important and useful information there for you to learn about a
package before deciding to upgrade or install it. It also provides the most
commonly used emerge operations with just a click or two. One of Porthole's
greatest features is that information is much quicker to find, especially if
you do not know what you are looking for. Porthole can search for (partial or
complete) package names, as well as searching package descriptions.

  13. http://porthole.sourceforge.net/

Porthole allows you to easily select and set USE flags, keywords, select
specific versions to emerge or unmerge, and toggle any of the emerge options
off or on. There is also a "Run Custom Command" option to send nearly any
command to Porthole's terminal. The terminal has configurable message
filtering (since before Portage implemented elog capabilities) and has a
command queue that can be paused and restarted.

New in porthole-0.6.0 is a saved description database that Porthole creates
and automatically updates when it sees that the Portage tree has been
updated. This provides for very fast description searches even on older
slower hardware. The results are browseable with just a mouse click.

Another new feature in porthole-0.6.0 is the ability to add "Sets" support to
existing Portage versions without waiting for portage-2.2 or switching to
pkgcore or paludis. Sets let you easily create your own package groups such
as a custom Gnome set, a server set, etc.

Porthole is available in several languages, and its developers are looking
for volunteers to update the translations and add new languages. They would
also like additional arch testing. Follow its development on Bugzilla[14] and
this forum thread[15].

Project Sunrise: the Gentoo user overlay
----------------------------------------

We all know that the Portage tree is huge, but even with the size of Portage,
sometimes some package is missing: a plug-in for some specific mail client,
or a brand-new fork of a web server. In such cases, you'd usually file a bug
at bugs.gentoo.org[16], but there's some chance your ebuilds won't make it to
the tree from there, at least not for awhile.

  16. http://bugs.gentoo.org

The trouble is "maintainer-wanted@gentoo.org" in the AssignedTo field, which
indicates that a Gentoo developer has yet to step up and maintain your
package. How about being your own maintainer of a package? Guess what: it's
possible!

Thanks to Project Sunrise[17], you can make your own ebuild and add it to a
package overlay maintained by users. After a review of your ebuild by Gentoo
developers (which usually takes at most two days), everyone will be able to
easily install your ebuild, as transparently as if it was in the Portage
tree.

  17. http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise

Interested? Check out http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise or stop by on
IRC at #gentoo-sunrise[18] on irc.freenode.net. Happy ebuild crafting!

Interview with Donnie Berkholz
------------------------------

Gentoo developer Donnie Berkholz[19] talked to David Abbott of
LinuxCrazy[20]. Download the podcast[21]. A transcript is available on the

He described how he became a developer and his work on X, the council, and
the public relations team and the Summer of Code project he's mentoring for.
Donnie also recommended the best video cards to buy if you want to support
open source. He saw the Linux desktop's future as increasing integration and
security. Here's how Donnie described how Gentoo makes progress and where to
go from here:

"The more time I spend in Gentoo, the more I realize that it's the individual
developers who really drive most of our innovations. They don't happen
because the council makes a decision. They happen because the developer, or a
few of them, think that it sounds like a cool idea, and make it happen."

"Making Gentoo great is my biggest goal right now, and greatness is a
process. It's not a place. So you can't get somewhere and say you're great.
You always have to keep striving for it. For a while we've been content to
stick with the status quo instead of striving for greatness, but we have to
change that and to always improve Gentoo."

Gentoo in the News
------------------

Gentoo received a favorable review[46] from Jones Productions, even beating
Ubuntu 8.04. The author also praised the extensive documentation.

  46. http://jonesproductionsltd.com/opinion/gentoo.aspx

The thing I love most about Gentoo is it gives the user the power to do
anything they want, and its just awesome to be able to use a Distro that you
built yourself.

==================
4. Tips and Tricks
==================

Command-line network monitoring
-------------------------------

Have you ever wanted facilities like top, but for your computer's network?
This tip shows you what options you have in command-line network monitors.

The first is IPTraf[47]:

  47. http://iptraf.seul.org/

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.1                                                           |
| Installing IPTraf                                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # emerge iptraf                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Using it is easy:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.2                                                           |
| Using IPTraf                                                               |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| $ iptraf                                                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

It is a highly advanced ncurses interface. You can choose view your network
status from many angles: IP traffic by port and IP address, general interface
statistics such as number of packets passing through, speed and volume of
packets passing through, and much more.

Another network monitor is vnstat. This program is useful for historical
statistics. It keeps a database for your interfaces.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.3                                                           |
| Installing vnstat                                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # emerge vnstat                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

It will need an hour to gather enough statistics. vnstat is installed with a
cron script (/etc/cron.hourly/vnstat) that updates vnstat's database every
hour. Once you have enough data in the database you can get hourly, daily,
and monthly data from vnstat. For example, to see hourly statistics:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.4                                                           |
| Viewing hourly statistics                                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| $ vnstat -h                                                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

A third program is iftop. iftop does for networking what top does for CPU
usage. It shows you which connections have the most traffic going in and out.
Install iftop:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.5                                                           |
| Installing iftop                                                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # emerge iftop                                                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Then run and use it just like top:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.6                                                           |
| Running iftop                                                              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| $ iftop                                                                    |
