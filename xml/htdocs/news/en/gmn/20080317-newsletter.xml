<title>This month in the GMN</title>
<body>

<p>
Hello and welcome to the third issue of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter. We would
like to thank our readers for their enthusiastic response, and hope that you
will continue to write in.  Although it may not be possible to respond to each
and every one of you, we can assure you that every mail we receive is read and
plays a role in shaping future editions of the GMN.  Remember, the GMN is what
its readers want it to be &ndash; please see the section on how you can get
involved &ndash; at the end of the newsletter for more information. 
</p>

<p>
Last month we ran graphical statistics on an experimental basis. While most of
you think they're a good idea in general, there seemed to be general dislike for
3D pie-charts. We've replaced two pie-charts with bar-graphs, and made the
remaining pie-chart two dimensional. We've also split the package addition and
removal lists by week, in hopes of improving readability.
</p>

<p>
You can discuss any aspect of this issue of the GMN in the corresponding <uri
link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-4968869.html">forum thread</uri>. We
look forward to hearing from you.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!

<title>Council Meeting Summary</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/">Gentoo Council</uri> held
its monthly meeting on 13 March, 2008. The items put up for discussion were:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Summer of Code</b> (Should Gentoo developers be allowed to participate?):
    Council members will become additional SoC admins, and will serve as
    tiebreaker votes if they aren't actively participating in project selection.
    The SoC admins will decide whether non-contributors should be favored over
    contributors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Package maintainers</b> (Creation of a new post): The general agreement
    was that the current recruitment process serves its purpose very well.
    <c>proxy-maintainers</c> will be promoted more aggressively in order to
    attract new contributors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>AMD64 arch team's big bug list</b>: <mail link="kingtaco"/> noted that it
    is hard to keep people interested in keywording. Anyone interested has had
    permission to keyword and stabilize non-system packages since 2007.1.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Open floor</b>: It was decided that having a list of attendees for every
    meeting would be useful. <mail link="dberkholz"/> will start creating the
    agenda along with the list in advance of the meeting. <mail
    link="flameeyes"/> will start working with the PR team on posting agenda and
    other items on a common Google calendar.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Some items were rolled over from the previous meeting:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>EAPI=0</b>: Ciaran McCreesh has been contributing and has committed quite
    a few things.  <mail link="halcy0n"/> hopes to work on it in the next couple
    of weeks. EAPI=0 is probably a week of solid work away from having a draft
    for review.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>GLEP 46</b> (Allow upstream tags in metadata.xml): No updates, as no
    authors were present.
  </li>
  <li><b>Document of being an active developer</b>: No updates.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Slacker arches</b>: <mail link="vapier"/> said he was going to work on
    <mail link="rich0"/>'s suggestion this weekend, and repost it for discussion
    on the development mailing list.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Gentoo International</title>

<section>
<title>Australia: linux.conf.au</title>
<body>

<p>
Towards the end of January, a first happened for Gentoo in Australia. Roughly
thirty users, developers and other Gentoo enthusiasts gathered into a lecture
theatre at the University of Melbourne during '<uri
link="http://mel8ourne.org/">linux.conf.au</uri>' for a series of talks making
up the first '<uri link="http://mel8ourne.org/programme/tuesday#gentoo">Gentoo
Down Under Mini-Conf</uri>'.
</p>

<p>
The morning began with Sura Mendis's introduction to the Mini-Conf and - for
those who had entered the wrong room - an introduction to exactly what Gentoo
is. Unfortunately the talk focusing on the Gentoo Hardened project was
cancelled, but that didn't seem to faze Ivan Miljenovic who stepped up to the
mark and discussed many of the tools that can assist in everyday Gentoo
administration. After morning tea, Patrick Ohearn gave his introduction to
Paludis, followed by <mail link="mark_alec"/> with pkgcore. Interestingly,
no-one in the auditorium had used either of these, with only a handful having
heard of them before. The Mini-Conf ended with Andrew Cowie delivering a talk
first given at Gentoo UK 2007 entitled "Looking back up the river". It suffices
to say it was very well done, and the discussions of the topic proceeded right
through lunch.

<title>Germany: Chemnitzer Linuxtage</title>
<body>

<p>
This year Gentoo was present at the <uri
link="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2008/info/">Chemnitzer Linuxtage</uri> in
Germany for the fifth time in a row, and it was indeed a massive success. As
usual, there was a booth showing Gentoo on common architectures like x86 and
amd64, but visitors could also see Gentoo running on an Efika PPC system, a
Geode based media center built into a wooden box, and on a PPC featuring KDE
4.0.1 and in a prefixed Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
<mail link="dertobi123"/> held a <uri
link="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2008/vortraege/detail.html?idx=134">talk</uri>
about building custom Live-CDs with catalyst and genkernel, but that wasn't all.
The whole of saturday afternoon was dedicated to a developer meeting in the
seminar room, which the team from the Chemnitzer Linuxtage provided (as well as
a nice buffet). Short talks were given about interesting topics such as a review
of supported architectures, <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/index.xml">Gentoo on OS
X</uri>, <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/vps/vserver-howto.xml">Gentoo
Vservers</uri>, the arch testing tool <uri
link="http://www.faulhammer.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=198&amp;Itemid=31">gatt</uri>,
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/">Overlays</uri>, Status of
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/kolab/">Kolab2</uri> and general
discussion about many more topics. Approximately 15 developers and users took
the chance to have a both an interesting and amusing time.

<title>Tips and Tricks</title>

<section>
<title>Encrypted USB Swap</title>
<body>

<p>
Large, high speed USB flash drives are now more affordable than ever.  At sizes
of 2GB and 4GB, these drives are an interesting alternative to swapping on disk.
When machines are thrashing to and from swap, a relatively huge amount of time
is spent seeking. Swapping on flash makes the seek time relatively negligible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Market Speak for Speed:</b> Affordable drives boast sustained speeds of 20
MBps for writing and 30 MBps for reading. When purchasing flash drives, speeds
are measured by factors such as 133X and 200X. The X factor is the same as for
CD ROM drives: 150 KBps.
</p>

<p>
<b>Measuring the Speed:</b> You can use the dd command to measure the speed of
your drive for reading:
</p>

<pre caption="Using dd to measure speed">
# <i>dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000 iflag=direct</i>
<comment># Or: (THIS COMMAND WILL OVERWRITE DATA ON YOUR DEVICE)</comment>
# <i>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M count=1000 oflag=direct</i>
</pre>

<p>
Flash devices have an internal block size of 4K so it is important to specify a
block size of at least this amount to accurately measure the device's optimal
speed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Encypted USB Swap:</b> Encrypting your swap prevents unencrypted sensitive
data, such as passwords, from being stored on the flash drive.  To enable
encryption, your kernel must have the <c>BLOCK_DEV_LOOP</c>,
<c>BLOCK_DEV_CRYPTO_LOOP</c> and <c>CRYPTO_AES</c> or <c>CRYPTO_AES_X86_64</c>
options enabled.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partitioning:</b> While not strictly necessary, partitioning your drives
makes the data easier to identify with the <c>fdisk</c> command. Partition your
drive with fdisk and specify a partition type of <c>82</c>. Find the unique name
of your flash drive swap partition with:
</p>

<pre caption="Identifying your drive">
$ <i>ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/usb-*-part1</i>
<comment># Example output:</comment>
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 6 23:40 /dev/disk/by-id/usb-PNY_USB_2.0_FD_AA7B020900000644-0:0-part1 -> ../../sdc1
</pre>

<p>
<b>Modifying fstab:</b> Add your partition to <path>/etc/fstab</path> to have
the swap automatically enabled on boot:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding an entry to fstab">
/dev/disk/by-id/usb-PNY_USB_2.0_FD_AA7B020900000644-0:0-part1   none    swap    sw,loop=/dev/loop7,encryption=AES128  0 0
</pre>

<p>
You can specify any loop device that you know will not be used at boot.
</p>

<p>
<b>Going Live:</b> To turn on your swap immediately:
</p>

<pre caption="Activating your swap partition">
# <i>swapon -a</i>
</pre>

<p>
Use either of these commands to see the status of your swaps:
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying your swap partition">
# <i>swapon -s</i>
<comment># Or:</comment>
$ <i>cat /proc/swaps</i>
</pre>

<p>
<b>A word of Caution!</b> Flash drives have a limited life span. For personal
use, a flash drive can easily last years. For heavy duty use, using a hard drive
may be a more appropriate alternative than occasionally replacing the flash
drive. A typical flash drive will allow 10,000 or 100,000 writes per block.
Decent flash drives use wear leveling techniques so that all the blocks wear out
evenly. Considering the worst case, a 4GB drive which is written to constantly
at 20MB/sec, a drive in such a situation would only last 23.7 to 237 days.

<title>tmpwatch never sleeps</title>
<body>

<p>
A cluttered <path>/tmp</path> is annoying. There are two possibilities to
automatically prevent that. The first possibility is to use a feature of
baselayout-2, simply set <c>WIPE_TMP</c> to "yes" in
<path>/etc/conf.d/bootmisc</path>. The second possibility is to use
<c>tmpwatch</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing tmpwatch">
# <i>emerge tmpwatch</i>
</pre>

<p>
It will install a cron entry: <path>/etc/cron.daily/tmpwatch</path>. Uncomment
one or all of the examples in the file. You can also write your own, such as:
</p>

<pre caption="Custom tmpwatch cron entry">
<comment># Delete everything except what is owned by one user</comment>
<keyword>if</keyword> [[ -d /tmp ]]; <keyword>then</keyword>
  <var>${TMPWATCH}</var> --exclude-user andrey --atime <const>168</const> /tmp
<keyword>fi</keyword>
</pre>

<p>
For more options, run:
</p>

$ <i>tmpwatch --help</i>
