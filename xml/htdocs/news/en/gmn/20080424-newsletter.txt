1. Introduction
===============

This month in the GMN
---------------------

Welcome to the April issue of the Gentoo monthly newsletter! This month, we
haven't made any significant changes from the previous edition. However, we
have featured an interview, and we hope to include more of them in future
issues. You'll note that we will be interviewing not only Gentoo developers,
but also people involved in the Gentoo community at large.

We also had to delay the publication of this issue by a few days in order to
accommodate the announcement of selected projects for this year's Summer of
Code.

As usual, you can discuss any aspect of this issue of the GMN in the
corresponding forum thread[1]. We look forward to hearing from you!

baselayout-2 and OpenRC hit the tree
------------------------------------

After a long wait, baselayout-2 and OpenRC have finally hit the unstable
tree. For those of you who want to be on the bleeding edge, please make sure
you read the migration guide[2] before attempting to upgrade. Both packages
are in ~arch for a reason. We recommend you don't upgrade these packages on
machines where stability is of prime importance.

Council Meeting Summary
-----------------------

The Gentoo Council[16] held its monthly meeting on April 10, 2008. The items
put up for discussion were:

  16. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/

  * Minimal activity for ebuild devs: Current activity required is 1
    commit every 60 days. Should it be higher? Agreement was hard to find.
    Some people thought it should be 1 commit / week, others said that people
    have busy lives and questioned the benefits. A number of people did agree
    that we should trust the judgment of the undertakers[17], and that the
    number of commits is not the only activity indicator.
  * Initial comments on PMS[18]: Are there any major changes needed, or
    just tuning details? The council voted that kdebuild-1 and other
    unapproved EAPIs could not be in an approved PMS document. The spec isn't
    a place for proposals or things that will never be submitted for approval
    by the council. It's a specification, a reference of what is allowed in
    the main tree.

  18. http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/pms.git

Some items were rolled over from the previous meeting:

  * GLEP 46 (Allow upstream tags in metadata.xml): Approved.
  * Document of being an active developer: No updates.

Coming Up
---------

  * Bugday[19]: Looking for a way to help out Gentoo without investing a
    lot of time? Join us on May 03 for our monthly bugday, and help us squash
    some bugs[20].
  * Trustees Meeting: There will be a single topic trustees meeting on
    May 04 - #gentoo-trustees on irc.freenode.net at 1900 UTC - with the aim
    of adopting the bylaws. All are welcome to attend.
  * Council Meeting[16]: The Gentoo Council meets every month to discuss
    important technical issues that affect Gentoo as a whole. This month's
    meeting is scheduled to be held on May 08, and everyone is welcome to
    participate - #gentoo-council on irc.freenode.net at 2000UTC.
  * LinuxTag Berlin[21]: The biggest European Linux event is on again. On
    the Berlin Fairgrounds, Gentoo will be featured again. Join developers
    and users on the booth between May 28 and 31, we hope it'll be as much
    fun as Chemnitz was!

=========================

Interview: Gentoo in a production environment
---------------------------------------------

This month, we had the opportunity to catch up with Ramon van Alteren[22],
team leader of the system engineering department at Hyves[23]. Hyves is a
European social networking site akin to MySpace, FaceBook or Orkut.

  22. http://ramon71.hyves.nl/
  23. http://www.hyves.net/

GMN: Please give us a brief introduction of yourself and your role at Hyves.

Ramon: I'm a long time Gentoo user both personally and professionally and
started using Gentoo somewhere in 2002 coming from Mandrake. Before that I'd
been using Linux for about 5 years.

Hyves is a social network site akin to MySpace, FaceBook, Orkut etc. The
website was originally started by Koen, Floris and Raymond, I joined the
company in November 2005 as the first paid sysadmin to help with managing the
40+ Gentoo linux servers.

The System Engineering department currently is a team of 9 people who manage
all servers from bare-metal provisioning up to the application software
including the network infrastructure. The website itself is created by the
developers (a team of 14 people).

GMN: What is the scale of your website?

Ramon: We currently have over 6 million registered users and counting, peak
performance is currently at 150+ million page views per day (13 million per
hour). These are filtered page views, raw http requests on our web farm are
well over 20.000 req/sec.

On our mysql database backend, we serve roughly 100.000 actions/sec at peak
performance. Aside from the web frontend and the database backend we have a
very large file-storage for media that our users upload. The total used
storage totals around roughly about 280 Terabytes. All in all with all hosts
accounted for we have 1800 servers most of them with 2 or 4 cores each. All
of these run Gentoo Linux. :-)

GMN: Why did you choose Gentoo Linux to power your infrastructure? What
features in particular made you choose Gentoo over all the other
distributions out there?

Ramon: We've been running on Gentoo Linux since the inception of the website.
There has been a very short period at the very beginning when the company
owned two colocated servers which came with Fedora but that was a very long
time ago. Our main reasons to switch to Gentoo were:

  * USE flags (the ability to easily switch additional functionality on
    or off)
  * Extreme customizability (custom ebuilds, install locations etc.)
  * Close tracking of upstream (speed of updates)
  * Good community support
  * Excellent documentation

We're using some very bleeding edge software in some cases to run our website
with fairly extensive customizations in general to adjust for scale and/or
performance. Portage, overlays and the ebuild system in general go a long way
to achieve that while staying within the Gentoo distribution framework for
all the other stuff.

The fact that a bare-bones Gentoo install doesn't come with all kinds of
cruft and distribution-centric customizations, helps to keep our systems mean
and lean.

In upgrading from php-4 to php-5 we've found slotting to be an invaluable
feature which eased the migration a great deal. Additionally we had to stay
on php-4 for some time after Gentoo deprecated support for it, pulling in
security patches with an ebuild turned out to be fairly simple, enabling us
to migrate at our own pace.

GMN: Please describe how you used the tools Gentoo offers to make maintaining
such a huge pool of servers easier.

Ramon: Most of our system administration is not done using Gentoo tools but
by using an automated configuration management system for Unix hosts called
puppet[24]. It uses eix[25] to build a package database.

  24. http://www.reductivelabs.com
  25. http://eix.sourceforge.net/

Among the tools Gentoo offers:

  * We use catalyst[26] to build our own stage3 and stage4 tarballs.
  * We use quickinstall by Andrew Gaffney[27] as part of our provisioning
    framework
  * Catalyst relies on genkernel[28] to build our kernel
  * We use Portage's binary package support for critical fixes

  26. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst/
  27. agaffney@gentoo.org
  28. http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/genkernel.xml

GMN: Have you been through any major "stumbling blocks" while setting up your
infrastructure? If so, how did you go about resolving them? Did you find the
various support avenues that Gentoo offers to be helpful at the time?

Ramon: Several of course! Most of them had absolutely nothing to do with
Gentoo but more with bugs and performance issues in various software
packages.

With respect to community support, we actively search and query IRC, bugzilla
and sometimes the forums as well. Additionally we track the gentoo-dev list
for changes. The forums tend to be a valuable source of information for
desktop issues we might have had (most of the system engineering team runs
Gentoo as desktop OS). However for large-scale server issues it has a bit too
high noise/content ratio because of its desktop oriented nature.

We try to give stuff that we learned back to the community by filing bugs, if
possible with patches. However we find that most of the stuff we customize is
of fairly limited interest to the larger community because of its focus on
our own environment.

Running a server park this large is usually eats away most of the time
available, so there is little left to clean up patches and/or ebuilds to make
them more generally usable. We do try to file amd64 keyword stabling reports
on stuff we deploy in our server park that hasn't been marked stable (yet).

GMN: Is there a feature that you wish Gentoo had?

Ramon: Let's see [rumbles around desk for the long list of features we'd wish
gentoo had]. More seriously, the list is actually surprisingly short:

  * Currently I'm working on getting stackless python[29] working in an
    agreeable fashion with the rest of the python framework in Gentoo. We've
    rolled out a preliminary stackless ebuild which basically installs it
    side by side with the normal python setup in /opt but I consider this to
    be sub-optimal at the least. We haven't finished it yet, but I think it
    will be doable.
  * I'd really really like to see a release-based Portage snapshot
    released together with the actual release. However, that is not of much
    use without a snapshot from the distfiles mirrors at the same time. This
    would make Gentoo less of a moving target and a more reliable base to
    build servers on. There has been talk about this on several mailing lists
    where people invariably object that this would create a false sense of
    stability because no one would port security patches and/or issues but as
    far as we are concerned that would not be necessary. I understand the
    constraints placed on the mirror system by such a setup. We are doing
    this internally for our stage4 files at the moment and that's pretty
    doable, but then, we only mirror the distfiles part (that we actually use
    in our stage4 builds) and not the entire Gentoo release with all the
    related desktop software.
  * We depend fairly heavily on the binary package support in Gentoo, and
    we need to separate packages over multiple ServerOS images (stage4
    builds) if we need them with different USE flags. I would like proper USE
    flag support for binary packages.
  * A little less aggressive pruning of ebuilds in the Portage tree would
    help. A lot of people are probably still running apache-2.0.x versions,
    as we are. They've left the Portage tree which is kind of sad, I miss
    them!

  29. http://www.stackless.com/

GMN: Any concluding comments?

Ramon: The beauty of Gentoo is that it offers a flexible framework for
building a highly customizable linux base to run your application on without
getting in the way. That flexibility and customizability brings its own
complexity but as far as I'm concerned it has been worth the trouble.

Running this kind of infrastructure with just 9 people is a form of highly
organized madness! If there are any developers or sysadmins out there with a
healthy interest in high-performance large-scale infrastructures and
Amsterdam I'd like to talk to them. We have open positions in both
development and system engineering and would prefer to hire people from the
Gentoo community.

We welcome feedback from the community, you can reach me personally by
email[30] or poke me on IRC (My nick is Innocenti on the Freenode network).
If you're interested in working with us, please don't contact me directly but
send mail to: jobs.sysadmin@hyves.nl.

  30. mailto:ramon@hyves.nl

And last but not least I'm really pleased to make the following announcement:

Based on a recent discussion with Robin H. Johnson[31] and Alex Howells[32]
from gentoo-infra, Hyves will sponsor the Gentoo community by helping out
with new servers for Bugzilla. We are putting up two large AMD64, 16Gb
servers with fast SCSI disks for the database backend and 2 beefy webservers
to improve the current bugzilla situation. We're currently working with infra
to get the stuff up and running and I hope the servers to go live soon.

Gentoo in the News
------------------

PC Magazine: An article featuring the Zonbu PC mentions that it runs Gentoo
Linux - "Though sold through a nontraditional channel there's no hard drive,
so you pay monthly for online storage the Zonbu PC is a good alternative to
the traditional desktop PC. It runs Gentoo Linux, which is a lot more usable
than the gOS Linux on the gPC. This is the EPEAT Gold and Energy Star 4.0
certified PC to buy if your computing needs run mainly on the Web. It's the
first PC Mag Green Approved product ever". For more information, check out
the complete article[57].

Linux Devices: PC-Doctor, a well known software vendor has developed a new
Network Factory appliance, which is currently in the prototype phase. The
device runs Gentoo, on an undisclosed hardware platform. The company chose
the Gentoo distro, "because we know it," said van Aman. "We chose a
source-based distribution because we only need to support a few hardware
configurations, and we want to squeeze the maximum performance out of the
hardware that we have". For more information, check out the complete
article[58].

| (Change)                                                                   |
| RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="no"                                                   |
| (To)                                                                       |
| RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="yes"                                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.2                                                           |
| Prevent the kernel from displaying status messages                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (Assuming you are using GRUB and /boot is mounted correctly)               |
| $ $EDITOR /boot/grub/grub.conf                                             |
| (Append the 'quiet' option to the kernel you use, for example:)            |
| kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.23.9 root=/dev/hda2 quiet                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.3                                                             |
| Remove services that you do not need                                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (View what services are currently activated on boot)                         |
| $ rc-status boot                                                             |
| (Check what is good with a default runlevel)                                 |
| $ rc-status default                                                         |
| (For example, you probably won't need keymap if you're building a carputer:) |
| $ rc-update del keymap                                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If you build your kernel with no modules, you can remove modules from boot.

Note: If you do not understand what a particular service or module does, do
not remove it!

You may also like to install BootChart[61], a tool for performance analysis
and visualization of the Linux boot process.

IRSSI and BitlBee
-----------------

Irssi and BitlBee are both great for simple chat clients. If you have a shell
available, we recommend you run them off the server, since you will never
logoff.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.1                                                           |
| Installing                                                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # emerge irssi bitlbee screenie                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

A previous GMN featured tips and tricks on screenie[62]. Now, configure
bitlbee to your taste, and start it:

  62. http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gmn/20080218-newsletter.xml#doc_chap4

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Listing 4.2                                                           |
| Starting bitlbee                                                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| $ /etc/init.d/bitlbeed start                                               |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now start screenie and start an irssi session:
