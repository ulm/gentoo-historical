<title>This month in the GMN</title>
<body>

<p>
Welcome to the April issue of the Gentoo monthly newsletter! This month, we
haven't made any significant changes from the previous edition. However, we have
featured an interview, and we hope to include more of them in future issues.
You'll note that we will be interviewing not only Gentoo developers, but also
people involved in the Gentoo community at large.
</p>

<p>
We also had to delay the publication of this issue by a few days in order to
accommodate the announcement of selected projects for this year's Summer of
Code.
</p>

<p>
As usual, you can discuss any aspect of this issue of the GMN in the
corresponding <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-5071942.html">
forum thread</uri>. We look forward to hearing from you!

<title>baselayout-2 and OpenRC hit the tree</title>
<body>

<p>
After a long wait, baselayout-2 and OpenRC have finally hit the unstable tree.
For those of you who want to be on the bleeding edge, please make sure you read
the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openrc-migration.xml">migration
guide</uri> before attempting to upgrade. Both packages are in ~arch for a
reason. We recommend you don't upgrade these packages on machines where
stability is of prime importance.

<title>Council Meeting Summary</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/">Gentoo Council</uri> held
its monthly meeting on April 10, 2008. The items put up for discussion were:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
   <b>Minimal activity for ebuild devs</b>: Current activity required is 1
   commit every 60 days. Should it be higher? Agreement was hard to find. Some
   people thought it should be 1 commit / week, others said that people have
   busy lives and questioned the benefits. A number of people did agree that we
   should trust the judgment of the <uri
   link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/undertakers/index.xml">undertakers</uri>,
   and that the number of commits is not the only activity indicator.
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>Initial comments on <uri link="http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/pms.git">PMS</uri></b>: 
   Are there any major changes needed, or just tuning details?
   The council voted that kdebuild-1 and other unapproved EAPIs could 
   not be in an approved PMS document. The spec isn't a place for 
   proposals or things that will never be submitted for approval by the 
   council. It's a specification, a reference of what is allowed in the 
   main tree.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Some items were rolled over from the previous meeting:
</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>GLEP 46</b> (Allow upstream tags in metadata.xml): Approved.</li>
 <li><b>Document of being an active developer</b>: No updates.</li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Interview: Gentoo in a production environment</title>
<body>

<p>
This month, we had the opportunity to catch up with <uri
link="http://ramon71.hyves.nl/">Ramon van Alteren</uri>, team leader of the
system engineering department at <uri link="http://www.hyves.net/">Hyves</uri>.
Hyves is a European social networking site akin to MySpace, FaceBook or Orkut.
</p>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Please give us a brief introduction of yourself and your role at Hyves.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> I'm a long time Gentoo user both personally and professionally and
started using Gentoo somewhere in 2002 coming from Mandrake. Before that I'd
been using Linux for about 5 years.
</p>

<p>
Hyves is a social network site akin to MySpace, FaceBook, Orkut etc.  The
website was originally started by Koen, Floris and Raymond, I joined the company
in November 2005 as the first paid sysadmin to help with managing the 40+ Gentoo
linux servers.
</p>

<p>
The System Engineering department currently is a team of 9 people who manage all
servers from bare-metal provisioning up to the application software including
the network infrastructure. The website itself is created by the developers (a
team of 14 people).
</p>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> What is the scale of your website?<br/>
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> We currently have over 6 million registered users and counting,
peak performance is currently at 150+ million page views per day (13 million per
hour). These are filtered page views, raw http requests on our web farm are well
over 20.000 req/sec.
</p>

<p>
On our mysql database backend, we serve roughly 100.000 actions/sec at peak
performance. Aside from the web frontend and the database backend we have a very
large file-storage for media that our users upload. The total used storage
totals around roughly about 280 Terabytes. All in all with all hosts accounted
for we have 1800 servers most of them with 2 or 4 cores each. All of these run
Gentoo Linux. :-)
</p>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Why did you choose Gentoo Linux to power your infrastructure?  What
features in particular made you choose Gentoo over all the  other distributions
out there?
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> We've been running on Gentoo Linux since the inception of the
website. There has been a very short period at the very beginning when the
company owned two colocated servers which came with Fedora but that was a very
long time ago. Our main reasons to switch to Gentoo were:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
   USE flags (the ability to easily switch additional functionality on or off)
 </li>
 <li>Extreme customizability (custom ebuilds, install locations etc.)</li>
 <li>Close tracking of upstream (speed of updates)</li>
 <li>Good community support</li>
 <li>Excellent documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're using some very bleeding edge software in some cases to run our website
with fairly extensive customizations in general to adjust for scale and/or
performance. Portage, overlays and the ebuild system in general go a long way to
achieve that while staying within the Gentoo distribution framework for all the
other stuff.
</p>

<p>
The fact that a bare-bones Gentoo install doesn't come with all kinds of cruft
and distribution-centric customizations, helps to keep our systems mean and
lean.
</p>

<p>
In upgrading from php-4 to php-5 we've found slotting to be an invaluable
feature which eased the migration a great deal.  Additionally we had to stay on
php-4 for some time after Gentoo deprecated support for it, pulling in security
patches with an ebuild turned out to be fairly simple, enabling us to migrate at
our own pace.
</p>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Please describe how you used the tools Gentoo offers to make
maintaining such a huge pool of servers easier.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> Most of our system administration is not done using Gentoo tools
but by using an automated configuration management system for Unix hosts called
<uri link="http://www.reductivelabs.com">puppet</uri>.  It uses <uri
link="http://eix.sourceforge.net/">eix</uri> to build a package database.
</p>

<p>
Among the tools Gentoo offers:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
   We use <uri
   link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst/">catalyst</uri> to
   build our own stage3 and stage4 tarballs.
 </li>
 <li>
   We use quickinstall by <mail link="agaffney"/> as part of our provisioning
   framework
 </li>
 <li>
   Catalyst relies on <uri
   link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/genkernel.xml">genkernel</uri> to build
   our kernel
 </li>
 <li>We use Portage's binary package support for critical fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Have you been through any major "stumbling blocks" while setting up
your infrastructure? If so, how did you go about resolving them? Did  you find
the various support avenues that Gentoo offers to be helpful  at the time?
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> Several of course! Most of them had absolutely nothing to do with
Gentoo but more with bugs and performance issues in various software packages.
</p>

<p>
With respect to community support, we actively search and query IRC, bugzilla
and sometimes the forums as well. Additionally we track the gentoo-dev list for
changes. The forums tend to be a valuable source of information for desktop
issues we might have had (most of the system engineering team runs Gentoo as
desktop OS). However for large-scale server issues it has a bit too high
noise/content ratio because of its desktop oriented nature.
</p>

<p>
We try to give stuff that we learned back to the community by filing bugs, if
possible with patches. However we find that most of the stuff we customize is of
fairly limited interest to the larger community because of its focus on our own
environment.
</p>

<p>
Running a server park this large is usually eats away most of the time
available, so there is little left to clean up patches and/or ebuilds to make
them more generally usable. We do try to file amd64 keyword stabling reports on
stuff we deploy in our server park that hasn't been marked stable (yet).
</p>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Is there a feature that you wish Gentoo had?
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> Let's see [rumbles around desk for the long list of features we'd
wish gentoo had]. More seriously, the list is actually surprisingly short:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
   Currently I'm working on getting <uri
   link="http://www.stackless.com/">stackless python</uri> working in an
   agreeable fashion with the rest of the python framework in Gentoo.  We've
   rolled out a preliminary stackless ebuild which basically installs it side
   by side with the normal python setup in <path>/opt</path> but I consider
   this to be sub-optimal at the least. We haven't finished it yet, but I think
   it will be doable.
 </li>
 <li>
   I'd really really like to see a release-based Portage snapshot released
   together with the actual release. However, that is not of much use without a
   snapshot from the distfiles mirrors at the same time.  This would make
   Gentoo less of a moving target and a more reliable base to build servers on.
   There has been talk about this on several mailing lists where people
   invariably object that this would create a false sense of stability because
   no one would port security patches and/or issues but as far as we are
   concerned that would not be necessary. I understand the constraints placed
   on the mirror system by such a setup. We are doing this internally for our
   stage4 files at the moment and that's pretty doable, but then, we only
   mirror the distfiles part (that we actually use in our stage4 builds) and
   not the entire Gentoo release with all the related desktop software.
 </li>
 <li>
   We depend fairly heavily on the binary package support in Gentoo, and we
   need to separate packages over multiple ServerOS images (stage4 builds) if
   we need them with different USE flags. I would like proper USE flag support
   for binary packages.
 </li>
 <li>
   A little less aggressive pruning of ebuilds in the Portage tree would help.
   A lot of people are probably still running apache-2.0.x versions, as we are.
   They've left the Portage tree which is kind of sad, I miss them!
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Any concluding comments?
</p>

<p>
<b>Ramon:</b> The beauty of Gentoo is that it offers a flexible framework for
building a highly customizable linux base to run your application on without
getting in the way. That flexibility and customizability brings its own
complexity but as far as I'm concerned it has been worth the trouble.
</p>

<p>
Running this kind of infrastructure with just 9 people is a form of highly
organized madness! If there are any developers or sysadmins out there with a
healthy interest in high-performance large-scale infrastructures and Amsterdam
I'd like to talk to them.  We have open positions in both development and system
engineering and would prefer to hire people from the Gentoo community.
</p>

<p>
We welcome feedback from the community, you can reach me personally by
<mail link="mailto:ramon@hyves.nl">email</mail> or poke me on IRC
(My nick is Innocenti on the Freenode network). If you're interested in
working with us, please don't contact me directly but send mail to:
<mail link="jobs.sysadmin@hyves.nl">jobs.sysadmin@hyves.nl</mail>.
</p>

<p>
And last but not least I'm really pleased to make the following announcement:
</p>

<p>
Based on a recent discussion with <mail link="robbat2"/> and 
<mail link="astinus"/> from gentoo-infra, Hyves will sponsor the Gentoo
community by helping out with new servers for Bugzilla. We are putting up
two large AMD64, 16Gb servers with fast SCSI disks for the database backend
and 2 beefy webservers to improve the current bugzilla situation. We're
currently working with infra to get the stuff up and running and I hope
the servers to go live soon.
</p>

<p>
<b>GMN:</b> Thank you, Ramon, for your time and for speaking with us!

<title>Speedup Boot Time</title>
<body>

<p>
Are you impatient when booting your computer? If yes, try the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Tell Gentoo's startup system to turn on services in parallel">
$ <i>$EDITOR /etc/conf.d/rc</i>
<comment>(Change)</comment>
<i>RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="no"</i>
<comment>(To)</comment>
<i>RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="yes"</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Prevent the kernel from displaying status messages">
<comment>(Assuming you are using GRUB and /boot is mounted correctly)</comment>
$ <i>$EDITOR /boot/grub/grub.conf</i>
<comment>(Append the 'quiet' option to the kernel you use, for example:)</comment>
<i>kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.23.9 root=/dev/hda2 quiet</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Remove services that you do not need">
<comment>(View what services are currently activated on boot)</comment>
$ <i>rc-status boot</i>
<comment>(Check what is good with a default runlevel)</comment>
$ <i>rc-status default</i>
<comment>(For example, you probably won't need keymap if you're building a carputer:)</comment>
$ <i>rc-update del keymap</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you build your kernel with no modules, you can remove modules from boot.
</p>

<note>
If you do not understand what a particular service or module does, do not remove
it!
</note>

<p>
You may also like to install <uri

<title>IRSSI and BitlBee</title>
<body>

<p>
Irssi and BitlBee are both great for simple chat clients. If you have a shell
available, we recommend you run them off the server, since you will never
logoff.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing">
# <i>emerge irssi bitlbee screenie</i>
</pre>

<p>
A previous GMN featured tips and tricks on <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gmn/20080218-newsletter.xml#doc_chap4">screenie</uri>.
Now, configure bitlbee to your taste, and start it:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting bitlbee">
$ <i>/etc/init.d/bitlbeed start</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now start screenie and start an irssi session:
</p>

<pre caption="Creating an IRSSI session">
$ <i>/connect 127.0.0.1</i>

<p>
Now follow the instructions and connect into your IM accounts and IRC, never
worrying about logging off.
