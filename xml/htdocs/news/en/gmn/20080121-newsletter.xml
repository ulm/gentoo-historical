		<body>
			<p>
				You are reading the inaugural issue of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter (GMN). The GMN
				replaces the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter, and hopes to bring you more consistent, high-quality
				articles on happenings in and around the Gentoo Community. The format of the GMN will
				remain more or less the same as the older weekly newsletter, but we are actively 
				seeking volunteers with more ideas on how to improve the content and presentation.
				The GMN is what its readers want it to be - please see the section on how you can get
				involved - at the end of the newsletter for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				We hope you enjoy reading the GMN, and look forward to receiving your feedback!

		<title>Council Meeting Summary</title>
		<body>
			<p>
				The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/">Gentoo Council</uri>
				held its monthly meeting on January 10, 2008. The items put up for 
				discussion were:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0054.html">GLEP 54</uri></b>:
					Portage maintainers were concerned that the GLEP didn't have any information
					on compatibility and implementation plans. A couple of other ideas
					that came up during discussion were to use '-scm' as a suffix, handle '-9999'
					versions per definition, or implement them as dynamic package sets. As there were
					too many unresolved questions, this item was postponed to the development
					mailing list for further discussion.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0055.html">GLEP 55</uri></b>:
					The council reached the conclusion that agreement on EAPI subdirectories
					was not feasible. The council postponed the item for further discussion on
					the development mailing list, as too many questions remained unresolved.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Enforcement of the Code of Conduct (CoC)</b>:
					Council members agreed on the general direction that the CoC was taking.
					<mail link="dberkholz" /> was appointed the task of providing additional details
					to the council
					<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">mailing list</uri>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Dealing with "Slacker Archs"</b>:
					<mail link="vapier" /> was appointed the task of working on <mail link="rich0" />'s
					<uri link="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/54103">suggestion</uri>
					to resolve the issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Providing developers with an "official" statement of being an active developer</b>:
					The option of automatically generating the document was proposed.
					<mail link="dberkholz" /> and <mail link="araujo" /> were appointed the task of
					creating a
					<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-office/scribus">scribus</uri> based

		<title>Improvements in ATI TV-Out</title>
		<body>
			<p>
				In one of the previous newsletter issues we reported about changes in
				nVidia driver packages. This time around, let's take a look at the state
				of ATI driver packages. ATI card owners will be pleased to know that 
				there have been improvements to ATI's Open Source and proprietary video
				drivers recently.
			</p>
			<p>
				<mail link="hanno" /> announced recently in
				<uri link="http://www.hboeck.de/archives/522-TV-Out-for-radeon-r200r300-cards.html">
				his blog</uri> that support for TV-out had been merged into the official xorg-ati
				driver. Thanks to his efforts in relicensing the GATOS project code under the MIT
				license (which is used by xorg); TV-out support will find its way into one of the
				next releases of
				<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati">xf86-video-ati</uri>.
				The code should work on most R200 and R300-based cards and is part of the new randr-1.2-branch.
				randr 1.2 is a new X technology that allows much better control of resolutions and output
				connectors.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until now, owners of newer ATI hardware were in a better situation; as the
				official 
				<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/x11-drivers/ati-drivers">fglrx</uri> driver
				had support for TV-out. Even though it might have been difficult to utilize the
				functionality, users at least had the option. With the recent driver release, however,
				<uri link="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=804&amp;num=1">
				phoronix</uri> reports that TV-out support in the fglrx driver has not only been
				improved - it will also be much easier to configure it, thanks to the transition
				to the catalyst control center interface.

	<section>
		<body>
			<p>
				This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
				and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
				in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri
				link="/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/">Treecleaners</uri> and various developers. Most
				packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
				and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
