<title>This month in the GMN</title>
<body>
<p>
Welcome to the second issue of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter. To begin with, we would like
to thank the entire community for the overwhelming response to the GMN's inaugural issue.
We received a lot of encouraging feedback and hope that you will continue to write in.
Remember, the GMN is what its readers want it to be - please see the section on how you can get
involved - at the end of the newsletter for more information.
</p>
<p>
This month's issue implements some of the interesting suggestions we received from our readers.
The security statistics have been removed, since it seemed to add a lot of clutter with little
value-addition to the newsletter. You can still monitor GLSAs in a variety of ways though - 
by using <c>glsa-check</c> (part of
<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-portage/gentoolkit">gentoolkit</uri>), by
subscribing to the feed on the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/">GLSA page</uri>
or the <c>gentoo-announce</c>
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">mailing list</uri>.
</p>
<p>
Graphical bugzilla and package statistics is another feature we implemented, don't forget to see
the cool graphs and charts! In tune with the feature on our front page announcements, you can
now discuss particular issues of the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter in the forum.
<uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-4871969.html">Discuss this newsletter</uri>!
</p>
<p>
We hope you enjoy reading this edition of the GMN.

<title>Gentoo Trustee Elections</title>
<body>
  
<p>
The Gentoo Trustee elections are currently in progress. After nearly a month of nominations, we are left
with 8 candidates for the posts. The polls will be open until February 28. Everybody who has ever
voted in a trustee election or has been a Gentoo developer for the last 365 days (or more, from the date
of close of election poll) is eligible to vote. You can get more information on the election and on each
candidate's manifesto on the

<title>Kernel security exploits: Upgrade ASAP</title>
<body>

<p>
Two major security flaws in the Linux kernel were reported last
weekend. Both flaws have the same impact (root access for local
users) and both exist within the vmsplice() system call, which was
added to the kernel in 2.6.17. There is no configuration option to
exclude vmsplice() so everyone is vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
One of the security issues existed for the entire lifetime of
vmsplice(), so any kernel version from 2.6.17 onwards is
vulnerable. This was fixed in 2.6.24.2, 2.6.23.16 and 2.6.22.18. It
has been assigned the vulnerability identifier of
<uri link="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0600">CVE-2008-0600</uri>.
</p>

<p>
The other security issue first appeared in 2.6.23. It was fixed in
2.6.23.15 and 2.6.24.1. This vulnerability has been assigned
<uri link="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0009">CVE-2008-0009</uri>
and <uri link="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0010">CVE-2008-0010</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<c>gentoo-sources-2.6.23-r8</c> and <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.24-r2</c> were
added to the tree Monday and include fixes for both issues. Install the
latest <uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/sys-kernel/gentoo-sources">gentoo-sources</uri>
as quickly as possible.

<title>KDE 4.0.1 in the tree</title>

<body>
<p>
Gentoo's KDE herd is happy to inform you that they've just committed KDE 
4.0.1 to the Portage tree. 
</p>

<p>
KDE 4.0.1 is the first maintenance release and fixes many issues of the 
initial release. Among those changes are stability bugfixes and 
performance improvements for
<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/kde-base/konqueror">Konqueror</uri>
and its Flash integration as well as its JavaScript support.
<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/kde-base/kwin">KWin</uri> has seen
improvements with respect to compositing and error handling. Almost all other KDE
modules have been worked on extensively as well.

<ul>

<li>
<b><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0046.html">GLEP 46</uri> </b>
(Allow upstream tags in metadata.xml): This GLEP was approved, however the proposer
is required to explain why the protocols that may be used were restricted
to HTTP and HTTPS only - before the GLEP is finalized.
</li>

<li>
<b>EAPI=1</b> (Where is the specification?):
The general agreement was that any new EAPIs should not be added until EAPI=0 is
fully approved. However, there wasn't any consensus on changing anything about EAPI=1.
<mail link="halcy0n"/> agreed to work on PMS for EAPI=0, and will provide an update
at the next meeting.

<!-- How do teams work -->
<section>
<title>The Emacs Team</title>

<body>

<p><b>Introduction</b>:</p>
<p>
Some people wonder how maintaining a bunch of packages works in
Gentoo and how they can help as users.  Every team has its own style
of work-flow but some common schemes are present in every team. This
month, we take a look at how the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/lisp/emacs/">Emacs</uri>
team functions.
</p>

<p><b>Who we are and what we do</b>:</p>
<p>
The Emacs team consists of two developers, <mail link="ulm"/> and
<mail link="fauli"/>, who take care of all packages in the
<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/category/app-emacs">app-emacs category</uri>
besides the GNU Emacs editor and several micro Emacsen. Additionally, we often take
care of Emacs support (mostly enabled by USE=emacs) for packages maintained by
other teams.
</p>


<p><b>How we work</b>:</p>
<p>
There are two ways of working: Act or react.  Reaction happens on
user requests that come in by bug reports (the preferred way), IRC or
by e-mail. Acting happens in mail exchange or discussion on IRC of the
team members.  We discuss problems we have had or ones that might occur
and try to find optimum solutions to them. Optimal in this case means
leaving as few people as possible with problems. This often means a
trade-off between features and backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Bug reports are handled by any of the members.  Whoever reacts first is
responsible for the bug, unless someone else has a superior solution.
New packages that are experimental are first tried out in the
<uri link="http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/emacs/">Emacs overlay</uri>,
which is connected to a Wiki system where we store temporary information
and progress reports.  For example, we collect information about packages
that have broken or bad Emacs support in the Wiki. Whenever one of us
finds time, the problem is fixed and the entry deleted from the Wiki.
Alternatively, if the problem could not be fixed, additional information
is added to the entry so the next person can start off where this one
left. The Wiki also stores information like which packages need a newer
version/revision in the tree (including a target date) and test plans for
many packages.
</p>
<p>
Stabilization is handled through the
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">bug tracker</uri>.  A maintainer
files a new bug which says "stable app-emacs/xyz-1.0" in the summary
and has all relevant architecture teams (such as x86, amd or sparc)
in the CC field. The architecture team then tests the package (with
the help of the collected test plans) and marks it stable.
</p>

<p><b>How users can help</b>:</p>
<p>
The easiest way to help is to file a bug report if you spot a problem.
Even minor ones are important for overall quality, such as if there is
a new version of a program/package that could not to be found in Portage.
Please give maintainers at-least a few days time after release though!
If you are not sure about a problem, try to investigate a bit. Don't be
afraid of your request being called "dumb", we actually prefer bugs that
can be closed as INVALID (or something similar) as compared to real issues
that may not be reported at all. Be sure to check for duplicate bugs
beforehand!
</p>
<p>
Users are welcome to join our IRC channel #gentoo-lisp on
<uri link="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</uri> where you can
get support for all flavours of Lisp (including Emacs Lisp). IRC is a
great way to directly contact developers.
<mail link="emacs@gentoo.org">Email</mail> is a good communication
channel too, but not perfect, as emails may get lost. Emails are also
forgotten more easily than bug reports.
</p>
<p>
Working on the overlay is another way to contribute, but we won't give away
commit access too easily as a simple change is potential for a lot of harm.
Trusted users do gain commit access after proving themselves. Some hints on
how GNU Emacs on Gentoo works can be found in the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/lisp/emacs/emacs.xml">
maintainers guide</uri>.

<title>Gentoo tops BIND benchmarks</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.isc.org/">Internet Systems Consortium</uri> conducted
a benchmark to test various operating systems for their suitability to run
<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/net-dns/bind">BIND 9</uri>. Amongst
all the operating systems tested, Gentoo Linux running on kernel version 2.6.20.7
topped the charts, processing 93,000 queries per second! Fedora Core came second
with 87,000 queries/second, followed by FreeBSD-7 (84,000 queries/second).

<title>Screenie</title>
<body>

<p>
Want to organize your command line screen session or sessions better?
Want to have a separate screen session for every task that you do?  Want
something that will organize you in general? This GMN has the perfect tip
for you. It is a tiny script called screenie.
</p>

<pre caption="Getting Screenie">
$ <i>emerge screenie</i>
</pre>

<p>
Start by running it.
</p>

<pre caption="Launching screenie">
$ <i>screenie</i>
</pre>

<p>
You should see the following:

</comment>
a) add job
q) quit

select:
</pre>

<p>
Lets add a job called "Systems". Once you hit <e>a</e>, enter the name.
Hit enter unless you know the process id of existing screen sessions.
</p>

<p>
Lets add a second job called "Email". Now you should see:

</comment>
1) 15468.Systems
2) 15504.Email

a) add job
q) quit

select:
</pre>

<p>
You now have two screen sessions that you can go into and out of. Select
one of the sessions. You are now inside of screen where you can do whatever
you usually do.
</p>

<note>
See the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030714-newsletter.xml#doc_chap9">
tips and tricks</uri> describing screen.
</note>

<p>
To go to another screen session, press <e>CTRL+a+d</e> (or however you usually
exit your screen sessions).  You should be back to the screenie menu and
ready to choose to go to another screen session.
</p>


<p>
One use of screenie might be to have a screen session for every task and
for every machine you have access to making multi-tasking much more organized.
This should also make it much easier to start working again after a long break.

<p>
The following section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri
link="/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/">Treecleaners</uri> and various developers. Most
packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
