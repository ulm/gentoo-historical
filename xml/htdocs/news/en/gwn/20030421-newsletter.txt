Portage security features detailed
----------------------------------
  
As reported previously[1], Portage will be getting some new security 
features as one of the last improvements to the 2.0 branch. Recently, a 
message[2] was posted to the gentoo-security mailing list that offers some 
more details about the upcoming features. Overall, the system relies 
heavily on the web-of-trust model put forth by GnuPG[3]. Users wishing to 
become more familiar with the security concepts behind the new Portage 
model should start by reading the GNU Privacy Handbook[4]

Open positions with the Gentoo Linux project
--------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Linux project is looking to recruit developers who would like 
to maintain one or more of the following packages: 
 
 * KDE and related packages 
 * wine (includes winex and related packages) 
 * courier 
 * exim 
 * postfix 
 * uw-imap 
 * cyrus 
 * sound tools (media-sound) 
 
Please email recruiters@gentoo.org if you are interested in any of these 
positions. 
    
Gentoo Linux is seeking additional source mirrors and colocation space
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
As many people have noticed recently, our system of source mirrors have 
been showing increasing signs of strain. This translates into slower 
download times, more "connection refused" messages and an overall increase 
in the length of time it takes to emerge packages. This problem has been 
especially apparent in North America, where we have fewer source mirrors. 
As such, Gentoo Linux is actively seeking sponsors willing to set up and 
maintain source mirrors. Our source mirrors policy[5] explains most of the 
details associated with setting up a new source mirror. Any additional 
questions related to setting up public source mirrors can be directed to 
Kurt Lieber[6].

Additionally, Gentoo Linux is also in need of servers and colocation space 
for its infrastructure servers. If you know of a company who might be 
willing to donate the use of a server, along with bandwidth and colocation 
space, please contact Kurt Lieber[7]. Most sponsors are eligible to 
receive recognition on our Sponsors[8] page. Additionally, certain key 
sponsors may receive additional marketing efforts, such as feature 
articles in the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter, to acknowledge their generous 
contributions to Gentoo Linux.

Gentoo Linux now available on the HPPA Platform
-----------------------------------------------
  
Gentoo Linux is now available on the HPPA platform. Though still in the 
early stages of development, the port is operational at this point and is 
best suited to console or server usage for now. X, fluxbox and framebuffer 
are all working and LiveCD and stages can be found in the 
/experimental/hppa/ directory on any of our mirrors[9]. 

 9. http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml
 
You can find a list of supported hardware on the ESIEE PA-Team website[10] 
and on the parisc-linux web site[11]. At this point, nearly all machines 
are supported. Installation instructions[12] are also available. Users 
experiencing problems can seek assistance in #gentoo-hppa on freenode and 
bug reports can be filed on bugs.gentoo.org[13]. The Gentoo Linux HPPA 
port needs your testing help to work out any remaining bugs. The Gentoo 
Linux/HPPA team is also looking for developers interested in helping with 
the port to HPPA. Interested parties should contact Guy Martin[14].

3. Developer's Corner
=====================
  
Developer's Corner is a new, semi-regular section that will appear in 
future editions of the GWN. Written by Seemant Kulleen, the development 
manager and project coordinator for Gentoo Linux, this section will 
feature development news about Gentoo Linux along with whatever else might 
be on Seemant's mind at the moment. 
 
Hello to my Gentoo friends. As you may have noticed, the xfree-4.3.0-r2 
ebuild has gone stable on most architectures. There are some things to 
bear in mind when you install this. First of all, you will have to unmerge 
xft. The reason behind this is that Xft is actually a module for X, and as 
such, the version included in the xfree build is newer and better. Second, 
games based on SDL (for example, Frozen Bubble and Unreal Tournament 2003: 
both the demo and the release version), may misbehave due to the new 
xfree. There is a new extension to X, called XRandR (go read the 
documentation :P), which causes these games to choose the lowest refresh 
rates for any given resolution. The fix for this is simple: emerge 
libsdl-1.2.5-r2, which contains a patch, or hack, to make it behave well 
with the new X. For games that include their own libSDL shared library, 
simply replace the libSDL-1.2.so.0 file with the one from libsdl-1.2.5-r2. 
See you next week! Oh, on a more personal note: Happy Birthday to my 
sister Sindhuja, and Happy 31st Anniversary to my parents.

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Luca Barbato
 
Featured this week is Luca Barbato[25], one of the Gentoo/PPC co-leads, 
who also maintains a custom version of Knoppix[26]'s cloop[27] (a 
compressed loopback filesystem), maintains the closed-source ATI drivers 
ebuild, and is an ATI Radeon tester for the XFree ebuilds. Luca had 
already fixed or submitted several ebuilds for programs he needed when he 
told Michael J. Cohen[28] that cloop could be made better by using a 
different compression algorithm. Asked to implement something to test 
that, he came up with 2 new versions, both faster than zlib cloop and one 
with a comparable compression ratio. Shortly thereafter, he was proposed 
as a developer. Luca's other contributions to OSS include his work on the 
BeOS port of FPSE (a PlayStation emulator; see http://linux.fpse.org/for 
more information) and a peer-to-peer netgame patch for frozenbubble[29] 
which he has begun working on with friends as a distributed computing 
course project.

 29. http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/frozenb-ptp
 
Luca, who likes gimp and sodipodi and installs mozilla on every machine he 
gets his hands on mainly uses an Athlon 850 with 768MB RAM, and a Radeon 
9700 Pro, as well as a 15" Powerbook G4. Both run GNOME2, as well as lyx, 
dia, abiword, and OpenOffice.org for non-coding stuff. He had to use 
eclipse for his Java course but still prefers vim for coding. 
 
A 21-year-old in his 3rd year studying computer science at the Politecnico 
di Torino[30], Luca's numerous hobbies include Live-action RPG, jujitsu, 
biking, windsail, snowboarding, traveling, books, Fumetti/Manga (that is, 
Italian and Japanese comics), volleyball, photography, and music (mostly 
epic metal, definitely not cheap dance/pop music). He lives in Turin, 
famous for being the first Italian capital, one of the best Egyptian 
museums in the world, and creepy legends about its underground caves.

Fonts, fonts and more fonts
 
Fonts seem to be a never-ending source of trouble for Linux. Between 
anti-aliased, freetype fonts, truetype fonts and all sorts of other font 
issues, it's no surprise that there are often a number of active 
font-related threads in the forums:
 
 * New freetype 2.1.4[31] 
 * Fonts - xft - fontconfig[32] 
 * The long-awaited Vera fonts are out!!![33]

Gentoo and the Sharp Zaurus
 
After researching the world of PDAs, Mathew Alexander decided to pickup a 
Sharp Zaurus SL-5500. He hoped to enhance this badboy by connecting to it 
through his Gentoo box, and vise-versa. Carefully following the official 
generic linux instructions resulted in a frustrating dysfunctional 
connection, another "wasted time" scenario well known to any geek. 
Fortunately the sound advice of the gentoo-user community brought Mathew's 
Gentoo box and Zaurus into harmony. David Golpira was particularly 
helpfull in providing his script[37] to setup NAT & routing, and Seth 
Rotherberg offered his solution[38]. Louis Candell recieves an honorable 
mention for becoming the Zaurus's 'uber-fan'[39].

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Preventing System Reboot with Ctrl-Alt-Del
 
The "Three-Finger-Salute" or, the key combination Ctrl+Alt+Del is 
typically mapped to the command /sbin/shutdown -r now. In other words, it 
reboots your system. Sometimes this may be unwanted behavior, so this 
week's tips shows you how to disable, or remap that key combination. 
 
The file we need to edit is /etc/inittab. Find the line that says 
ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -r now and simply comment it out by 
putting a # in front of it. Or, if you prefer, you can change the 
/sbin/shutdown -r now part to another command. 
 
Lastly, we need to tell the init process about these changes.
