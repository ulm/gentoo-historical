Gentoo Weekly Newsletter

This is the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter for the week of July 26th, 2004.

1. Gentoo News
==============
  
net-www being retired
---------------------
  
During the week starting 2nd August 2004, we will be moving *all* of the 
packages currently in net-www to new homes in the Portage tree. net-www 
has outgrown its original purpose, and the new categories that we are 
adding will make it much easier for users to find the packages they want. 
 
The full list of packages can be found here[1]. Portage will automatically 
upgrade any packages you have installed the next time you run emerge -u. 
However, you will manually need to fix any entries in 
/etc/portage/package.* to refer to the new categories.

Volunteers required: UK Meeting Organising Committee
----------------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Linux Project are looking for volunteers who would be willing 
to organise a meeting in Manchester for UK-based Gentoo developers and 
users for September or early October. We're looking for people who can 
spare the time to: 
 
 * organise a venue and internet access 
 * organise accomodation for those travelling from afar 
 * organise talks, events, publicity, etc etc 
 * anything else that you can think of 
 
Please contact Stuart Herbert[2] if you'd like to help out, and let him 
know who you are and what you can do to help make this meeting happen. 
Stuart can't organise this himself, so if you're in the UK and want to see 
something like this happen, now is the time to lend a hand.

==================
2. Projects Update
==================
   
Portage
 
The net-www category in the portage tree is being retired. Packages 
currently residing there have been moved to newer, more descriptive 
categories. Updates should occur automatically when emerging, although 
users will need to edit their /etc/portage/* files if they cite the 
category. 
 
Devrel
 
The Developer Relations team have released an updated Gentoo Developer 
Handbook[3] outlining standards and policies for developers. 

 3. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml
 
Infrastructure
 
Most of the infrastructure developers will be attending Linux World 
Expo[4] next week in San Francisco. Interested Gentoo users are invited to 
stop by the booth to meet some of the team.

Releng
 
The Release Engineering team is pleased to announce that the 2004.2 LiveCD 
will be available, on schedule, on July 26th (the date of publication for 
this article). 
 
Tools
 
The tenshi[5] log-monitoring program (formerly known as wasabi) has a new 
version 0.3 release. This project was originally developed by members of 
the infrastructure team to provide for structured monitors and alerts for 
server log files.

Unreal Tournament 2003/2004: Buffer overflow in 'secure' queries
----------------------------------------------------------------
  
Game servers based on the Unreal engine are vulnerable to remote code 
execution through malformed 'secure' queries. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[6] 

 6. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200407-14.xml
    
Opera: Multiple spoofing vulnerabilities
----------------------------------------
  
Opera contains three vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to impersonate 
legitimate websites with URI obfuscation or to spoof websites with frame 
injection. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[7] 

 7. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200407-15.xml
    
Linux Kernel: Multiple DoS and permission vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------------------
  
Multiple permission vulnerabilities have been found in the Linux kernel, 
allowing an attacker to change the group IDs of files mounted on a remote 
filesystem (CAN-2004-0497), as well as an issue in 2.6 series kernels 
which allows /proc permissions to be bypassed. A context sharing 
vulnerability in vserver-sources is also handled by this advisory as well 
as CAN-2004-0447, CAN-2004-0496 and CAN-2004-0565. Patched, or updated 
versions of these kernels have been released and details are included 
along with this advisory. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[8]

l2tpd: Buffer overflow
----------------------
  
A buffer overflow in l2tpd could lead to remote code execution. It is not 
known whether this bug is exploitable. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[9] 

 9. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200407-17.xml
    
mod_ssl: Format string vulnerability
------------------------------------
  
A bug in mod_ssl may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code 
when Apache is configured to use mod_ssl and mod_proxy. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[10]

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
   
Stephen Becker
 
Figure 4.1: Stephen Becker
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20040726_geoman.jpg
 
Our featured developer for this week is Stephen Becker[11] (geoman), one 
of the developers for Gentoo's port to the MIPS[12] architecture, focusing 
on X11 and Desktop packages. His primary duties are testing ebuilds for 
that architecture, and setting their keywords accordingly. In particular, 
he works on ensuring that the various Gnome packages emerge and run 
properly for MIPS machines. He also pays particular attention to several 
multimedia and sound applications. 

 11. geoman@gentoo.org
 12. http://www.linux-mips.org/index.html
 
Stephen has been a Linux user since 1997, commencing with the venerable 
Slackware. In 2001, he began experimenting with source-based 
distributions, especially the Sorcerer[13] distribution. When that effort 
ran into trouble and began to fragment, he shifted to Gentoo and has been 
there ever since. Not long after Gentoo released the MIPS port, Stephen 
had it up and running on his SGI Indy, and began to experiment with 
getting accelerated X up and running. Despite claims that "kumba put 
something in [his] drink", Stephen was invited to become a Gentoo 
developer after his work patching ebuilds and comments became known to the 
other alternative architecture developers. Stephen characterizes Gentoo as 
making "Linux very usable and fun at the same time". 

 13. http://sorcerer.wox.org/
 
Stephen has a "whole room dedicated to computers", the set of which 
includes what he styles a "franken-puter": a frame for which he 
periodically scavenges parts for upgrades. Its current incarnation is as a 
Celeron 600 firewall/gateway/server (as well as a few other uses). Behind 
that sentry is his LAN, which includes his wife's Duron 1.6 GHz, his 
AthlonXP 1.53 GHz and a Pentium 233 relegated for duty as a DOS games 
platform. More esoteric nodes on the LAN include an SGI O2, a Sun Ultra 1, 
and two SGI Indys. One of the Indys serves as an mp3/esound server for his 
stereo system. 
 
Stephen enjoys building model cars and planes, and has recently dabbled in 
radio-control. He is an avid sports fan, both as spectator and player, 
rooting for the various St. Louis professional teams and playing 
basketball as well as mountain biking. He completed a Masters in Geology 
at the University of Missouri at Rolla, and is currently a Doctoral 
candidate at Virginia Tech, still studying Geology. His Masters' work 
focused on characterizing fluid flow events in Irish metallic ore 
deposits, and he is currently researching high-pressure (10's of thousands 
of PSI) fluid inclusions in quartz crystals. His intent is to apply this 
research to studying natural fluid incursions in ore deposits using laser 
probes and mass spectrometry. He lives in Blacksburg, Virginia with his 
wife of just over a year, Kris. They are expecting their first child in 
November.

Flashing BIOS with Gentoo
 
Generally, motherboard manufacturers provide upgrades the their product's 
BIOSes with an MSDOS-executable flashing utility as well as a binary image 
of the new BIOS. Gentoo users are usually out of luck when it comes to 
using these tools, or are they?
