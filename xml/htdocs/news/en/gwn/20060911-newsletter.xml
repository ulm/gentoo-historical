<title>New Gentoo Council elected</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/">Gentoo Council</uri> is
the elected governing body of Gentoo and decides on global issues and policies
that affect multiple projects in Gentoo. It also serves as an appeal court for
disciplinary decisions. The Council members are elected for a year and must hold
monthly public meetings.
</p>

<p>
The new council for the coming year has been elected. The polls were open for
a one-month voting period, to allow all developers a chance to vote on their
elected representatives. The winners of this year's council vote are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Diego Pettenò (Flameeyes)</li>
<li>Mike Doty (KingTaco)</li>
<li>Danny van Dyk (Kugelfang)</li>
<li>Bryan Østergaard (kloeri)</li>
<li>Robin H. Johnson (robbat2)</li>
<li>Mike Frysinger (vapier)</li>
<li>Chris Gianelloni (wolf31o2)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of the new council, only Mike Frysinger is returning for another tour. The GWN
staff wishes to congratulate all of the new council members and wishes them a
productive year.

<title>Donation from Cloanto: Amiga Forever CD</title>
<body>

<p>
This week, Gentoo received a donation of the <uri
link="http://amigaforever.com">Amiga Forever CD</uri> from Cloanto. The <uri
link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</uri> is the family of personal
computers developed initially by Amiga Corporation and later by Commodore
International. These computers had great success due to their graphics and
sound, which were far ahead of their time. Therefore, Amiga received its
nickname, the ultimate games machine. These computers are in the past, but
fortunately, the power of modern PC hardware has made it possible to emulate
Amiga software and games. Gentoo provides two Amiga emulators
<c>app-emulation/uae</c> and <c>app-emulation/e-uae</c>. However, to make full
use of these programs, one must have access to an image of the Amiga Kickstart
ROM. To properly maintain these packages, access to the Amiga Kickstart ROM is
required for Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
The Amiga Forever CD is the award-winning Amiga preservation, emulation, and
support package, made by Cloanto, Amiga developers since 1986. Cloanto has made
this CD available to all Gentoo developers to aid in the maintenance of the
Amiga emulation programs.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo would like to thank Cloanto for this generous donation.

<title>Monolithic X no longer supported</title>
<body>

<p>
Developer <mail link="dberkholz@gentoo.org">Donnie Berkholz</mail> wrote to the
<c>gentoo-dev</c> mailing list about the discontinuation of support for the
monolithic X ebuilds. This means there will be no more fixes added to the
monolithic packages, including no more security fixes. Package maintainers
will begin removing dependencies for the monolithic ebuilds from their
packages. Donnie hopes to move the monolithic X ebuilds into an overlay soon.
</p>

<p>
Users still using the old monolithic ebuilds should upgrade to modular X using
the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/x/x11/modular-x-howto.xml">
Migrating to Modular X HOWTO</uri> instructions.

<title>"Gentoo, it's what all the cool kids are doing." -Joshua Nichols</title>
<body>

<figure link="/images/gwn/20060911_nichoj.jpg"
  short="nichoj" caption="Joshua Nichols, aka nichoj"/>

<p>
Developer Joshua Nichols, aka nichoj, resides in Boston, MA - known for their
baked beans and tea parties... OK, one in particular. He graduated last spring
from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a dual degree in Computer Science
and Psychology. At 23, Josh shares an apartment with three friends and one
phantom roommate. They have no pets, but Josh considers himself a dog lover and
hopes to have a German Shepard when he has more time and a bigger place.
</p>

<p>
Josh works for Banta Corporation, a print and supply chain management company,
not that anyone knows what that means. His office develops web applications,
both internal and external. Josh works with a team developing modular web
applications, primarily with Java and J2EE (like Eclipse, Tomcat, Spring, JDO,
web services, etc).
</p>

<p>
Nichoj claims some fairly canon interests as far as geekery goes. He enjoys
reading, mostly sci-fi and fantasy, and some occassional technical reference,
for a bit of light reading. He also really enjoys watching Adult Swim, but
don't we all?  When Josh manages to get out of the house, it may be for some
rollerblading or hackey sack, but will inadvertently end up like many Boston
festivities... having a few drinks with friends at one of the many Boston
drinking establishments.
</p>

<p>
Josh started using Gentoo back in his freshmen year at college. He had been a
Linux user for years but found that hand configuring things quickly became hard
to maintain and discovered that using Gentoo helped him maintain his computer
the way he wanted. About a year ago, Josh decided that he wanted to be more
involved with open source software. He started attending the LUG's, actively
reporting bugs, and helping people on IRC. He was becoming rather proficient
with Java, and was quickly recruited by karltk. Josh's current role with Gentoo
is one that he rather enjoys, as the Java Project Lead.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the Gentoo achievement Josh is most proud of is his contribution to the
new Java system, which was released a few months ago. While it was mostly
developed by the time Josh joined the team, they did quickly realize that all
of their 400+ Java packages would have to be updated. Josh is very proud to
have contributed to the planning and execution, as well as working through the
inevitable rough edges upon rolling it to the ~arch masses. Of noteworthy
mention, Josh received his first 'hate mail' while working on this project; he
must have been doing something right. ;-)
</p>

<p>
Josh's primary desktop is an AMD64 box, sporting an X2 4400+, 4GB of RAM, and a
7800GT connected to a 24" LCD. He also has two Dell x86 laptops, an Athlon XP
file server, and a G5 desktop for some PPC goodness. His first apps launched?
Compiz and CGWD of course, shortly followed by GAIM, Firefox, and Thunderbird.
</p>

<p>
Josh's parting words were that of wisdom: "It may be obvious, but you should
enjoy what you do. This can be both applied to work within open source projects
or with a job. If you're doing something you can't enjoy, or even worse, hate,
well, that's bad mmmkay. It'll make your hair grey prematurely, and you might
even poke your own eyes out in frustration. I don't know about you, but I like
having both eyes. But seriously, I feel fortunate to be able to thoroughly
enjoy both my work for Gentoo and my day job."

<p><b>A graphical program for creating ebuilds</b></p>

<p>
A suggestion to create a graphical program, an IDE of sorts for the purpose of
creating ebuilds has been proposed on the forums. Those in favor claim that a
program could substantially reduce the effort in writing ebuilds from scratch,
as it will ask the user for the information required. Those against the idea
cite that the complexity of options in ebuilds would make such a program
impossible to create without limiting the options or providing an ill-thought
out interface. Whether you support the idea or not, this is not the first time
such a program has been proposed. Efforts in the past were made by Pythonhead,
a Gentoo developer, in the now stagnant Abeni package.

<title>Australia: Software Freedom Day, Canberra</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/">Canberra Software Freedom
Day</uri>, on the 9th of September, was an event talking about software
freedom, encouraging people to give Linux a go and handing out Gentoo,
<uri link="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</uri>, and <uri
link="http://www.theopencd.org/">TheOpenCD</uri>. After the event, 48 people
have a new Gentoo Linux 2006.1 x86 LiveCD, and 23 have a 2006.1 amd64 LiveCD.

<p>
All participants had a lot of fun meeting interesting people watching the 
<uri link="http://orange.blender.org/">Elephants Dream</uri> production. People
were interested in alternatives to avoid spyware/viruses,  making their old PC
hardware useful again as backup/storage servers and making old laptops usable 
again.
