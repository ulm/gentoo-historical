Where is Gentoo Linux 1.4?
--------------------------
  
One of the most often asked questions in the Gentoo Forums, mailing lists 
and IRC channels is, "When will Gentoo Linux 1.4 be released?" While we 
don't have an exact date to answer that question, we will provide an 
update on the progress made towards 1.4 later on. First, however, let's 
clear up one common misconception that many Gentoo users have. Releases do 
not matter in Gentoo Linux. If you install any version of Gentoo Linux and 
complete an emerge -u world, congratulations, you are running the most 
current version of Gentoo Linux. You can start with one of the current 
LiveCDs for installation purposes, or you can use any number of other 
alternatives[1]. Either way, you're going to end up with a cutting-edge, 
fully-optimized installation of Gentoo Linux, tailored to your 
specifications.

So why does Gentoo Linux have numbered releases at all? Good question and 
one that has been debated internally amongst the development team. There 
are some features of Gentoo Linux that are tied to version numbers, most 
notably the Gentoo Reference Packages and the LiveCD used for 
installation. 
 
As for the promised update about the current status of Gentoo Linux 1.4, 
work continues towards our goals and milestones tied to 1.4. Work has been 
done[2] towards an optional script that will allow users to automatically 
set CFLAGS and CHOST variables. Improvements to stager have been made 
available in the experimental[3] section of our distfile mirrors and new 
GRP packages are being prepped as well. As with all Gentoo products, a 
release will be made when the product has met our quality and stability 
standards, and it is not tied to any specific date.

The Meta Package project
------------------------
  
As recently announced[4], Gentoo has joined forces with DarwinPorts[5] and 
Fink[6] to provide a collection of quality, freely-distributable software 
to the Macintosh OS X community. More information can be found at 
metapkg.org[7].

Two additional new source mirrors for North America
---------------------------------------------------
  
Continuing the recent trend[8] we're pleased to announce two new Gentoo 
Linux source mirrors in North America, graciously provided by Seren 
Innovations[9] and Adelie Linux[10].

GWN looking for additional translators for Portuguese (Brazil) version
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Weekly Newsletter is looking for help with its Portuguese 
(Brazil) translation. Candidates should have a solid understanding of both 
written Brazillian Portuguese as well as written English. Interested 
parties should send an email to gwn-feedback@gentoo.org.

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
D.M.D. Ljungmark, aka Spider
 
This week we're featuring Spider, who maintains many of the Gnome ebuilds 
as well as some others spread around the tree. Spider was actually a 
member of the Gnome Packaging Project when he switched from his own 
reworked distribution to Gentoo, and so his involvement began with the 
building of Gnome2 packages as well as some loose ends to the project like 
Vi, Nethack, POVRay, and others. Right now he's working on porting the 
Ximian G2D patches to Gentoo; otherwise he generally follows releases and 
works to ensure a smooth path to get them into the tree. A member of the 
Gnome Foundation in addition to the Gnome Packaging Project, Spider has 
also written hints and tips for LinuxFromScratch[38], and his proudest 
achievement to date is the Migration Guide[39]. 

 38. http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/
 39. http://gentoo.org/~spider/migration-guide.html
 
A minimalist command-line junky with a soft spot for well-designed CLI 
tools and other things that "wrap around your fingers" like lftp, zsh, and 
epiphany, Spider is currently using two 1GHz Athlon machines: one testing 
Ximian Gnome on Gentoo, the other running Openbox, sylpheed, xchat-1.8, 
and a horde of aterms running zsh and/or vim. 
 
Spider was a judo instructor who spent a lot of time in the dojos but is 
now suffering chronic depression, social phobia, and anxiety disorder in 
his mid twenties. Currently on a disability pension and taking a summer 
break from social rehabilitation, he says he spends too much of his time 
by his computer. He's also been feeding his music addiction, dabbling in 
the questionable art of digital photography, and having heated arguments 
with friends and acquaintances while feeding his Mocha addiction in 
various cafes. Spider lives in Norrköping, and stays awake for too long 
to sit and watch the dawn outside his window, and swears a lot at the fact 
that it never gets dark out there (Because this[40] is as dark as the 
night gets there).

LiveUSB? Keychain to Boot
 
A very interesting discussion has slowly been growing around the ability 
of recent BIOSes to boot not only from traditional devices like CDs, 
floppies or network drives, but from removable USB sticks with flash 
memory, too. The small plug-in stubs are available with anything from 64 
MB well into the GB range, and are well worth the effort if you want to 
carry your Gentoo about, or boot Linux on somebody else's PC. The gist: 
You can easily write data back to a USB device, try that with a silver 
platter...

Improving The Mozilla Web Browsing Experience
 
Seeing that installing or finding plugins for the Mozilla Web Browser can 
sometimes be a pain, Mknecht made a suggestion to improve the situation. 
his suggestion included creating an all-inclusive ebuild that would grab 
most plugins automatically. Other users came up with different ideas, 
ranging from manual installs, to a full fledged "gentoo service site" that 
would automatcally point you to the needed plugins for various file 
formats. The thread can be found here[47].

Internationalization of gentoo.org
 
You hear a distant rumble... Initiated by FRLinux[49], some of the 
translators busy hacking away at portions of the Gentoo website, including 
this newsletter, have started an initiative to internationalize the Gentoo 
website itself. There's a motion[50] on bugs.gentoo.org that tries to win 
support for Net- and FreeBSD-like language handling for the entire 
website, linguistically transparent and completely consistent over all 
versions. Suggestions include links from the main website to international 
efforts on {ISO country code}.gentoo.org, and you can join the discussion 
either via Bugzilla or the Forums, in a thread called "Gentoo 
International Community"[51] (it's in French, do feel free to open an 
English thread about the same subject in Other Things Gentoo).

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Querying Portage with etcat
 
This week's tip shows you how to use the etcat command to retrieve 
information on Portage, USE flags, package versions, and much more. 
 
While there are other package query utilities such as qpkg or epm, etcat 
has some unique features. Some of these features include the ability to 
display the amount of disk space a particular package is using, the USE 
flags the package was compiled with, and the versions available for a 
package. 
 
The first step is installing the app-admin/gentoolkit package from 
Portage. This installs etcat (among other utilities) to /usr/bin. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.1:                                                       |
| Getting etcat                                                           |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# emerge app-admin/gentoolkit                                            |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
To view the size of the package, use etcat size [package]. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't specify the category, etcat will try to find all possible 
matches in Portage. If the package name is common or occurs in many other 
package names, you may get a lot more output that you wanted.  
For more detailed information, type man etcat. For a quick overview of 
available options, just type etcat.
