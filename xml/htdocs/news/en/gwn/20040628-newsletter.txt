First Installation of Gentoo Linux on a Quadruple Opteron
---------------------------------------------------------
  
There are offers simply impossible to turn down. When Gentoo developer 
Lars Weiler (Pylon) was approached to try an installation on the finest 
machine displayed at the Hewlett-Packard booth during the German LinuxTag, 
the HP staff really didn't have to ask him twice. A Proliant DL 585 
featuring four 2.2 GHz AMD64 CPUs with 1 MB of L2 Cache each and a total 
of 16 GB of RAM was sitting at the HP stand, and the RedHat environment 
already installed served as the base of a chroot installation of Gentoo 
Linux - the first installation ever on this type of machine, and the first 
time anyone got a 2.6 kernel to run on it. In spite of the warnings in the 
hardware manual, Pylon managed to install a 2.6.7 kernel, bootstrapped a 
stage1 install in 25 minutes and was done with a complete stage3 
installation after another 45 minutes. The HP staff was so pleased with 
the fact that they had Gentoo running on their quadruple Opteron beast, 
they took over and set up the management software for 16 other Opteron 
cluster machines in the same rack, fiddled a little with Povray rendering, 
and merrily ran Gentoo Linux for the remaining two days of the LinuxTag.

Gentoo Present at the LinuxTag in Karlsruhe
-------------------------------------------
  
With more than 20,000 visitors the LinuxTag in Karlsruhe is by far the 
most important Linux and Open Source show in Europe, and the statistics at 
the Gentoo booth matched the record figures of the event as a whole.During 
the four days of the event, 15 developers and other Gentoo activists 
shared in manning the booth. On top of the obligatory x86 PCs, six 
architectures running Gentoo Linux were on display this year, including an 
SGI Indy, an Xbox, several Macintosh laptops, an HP PA/RISC machine, a DEC 
Alpha and a Sparc Ultra 10. It was also the first occasion to register as 
a member of the Gentoo e.V., the German not-for-profit association set up 
a few weeks ago.

2. Projects Update
==================
   
Infrastructure
 
The Infrastructure project team reports that they have received two new 
servers from the Open Source Lab at Oregon State University[1]. These are 
dual Xeon machines with 1 GB of RAM each, which will provide new homes for 
the forums as well as bugzilla and packages.gentoo.org. The infrastructure 
team is also working on developing and deploying some new survey software 
which will help gather better information about Gentoo users, how they use 
the distro, and what they would like to see. There has been a new server 
added to the rsync.gentoo.org rotation.

Security
 
The Security team was pleased to report that they have set records for the 
number of GLSAs released for each of the last three months, and seem well 
on the way to setting another one this month. This is a strong indication 
that the processes for identifying, documenting and fixing security bugs 
are in place and working well. Thierry Carrez[2], Sune Kloppenborg 
Jeppesen[3] and KrispyKringle[4] were specifically identified as having 
done "yeoman's duty in keeping our security bugs under control".

Releng
 
The Release Engineering project informed us that Chris Gianelloni[5] will 
be serving as the the Release QA manager, and that Roger Miliker[6] has 
joined the team. Testing for the 2004.2 release is well underway, and test 
releases of the new LiveCDs are available on the Gentoo mirrors under the 
path /experimental/x86/livecd. Bugs on the test releases, as always, 
should be reported at bugs.gentoo.org[7]. The catalyst tool for building 
LiveCDs has been updated significantly, including better support for 
distcc and the option of using an overlay for the portage snapshot. New 
versions should appear in portage soon.

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
   
Marius Mauch
 
Our featured developer for this week is Marius Mauch[13] (genone), a 
member of the portage[14] developers group. He is not tied to any specific 
sub-project, but works as needed on areas ranging from portage and its 
associated tools through developer and user support, bugzilla maintenance 
and ebuild maintenance in app-portage and others such as 
sylpheed-claws[15] and gambas[16].

 15. http://sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net/
 16. http://gambas.sourceforge.net/
 
Marius has been using Linux since Suse 6.1 in 1998, although he was 
introduced to it somewhat earlier when a friend lent him a boot disk to 
repair a failed Windows install. He remained a Suse user through version 
7.1 and tried Red Hat 7.3 and 8.0 - the latter he describes as "one big 
bug". A few Slashdot postings about Gentoo encouraged him to try it under 
VMWare in the Summer of 2002. That fall, he installed Gentoo on one of his 
desktops. Marius promptly began tweaking portage on his new system. After 
he contributed a number of patches to portage and several new ebuilds, he 
was invited to join the Gentoo team as a developer last September. When 
asked to identify work he had been particularly pleased with, he mentioned 
the modifications to the GLSA framework outlined in GLSA 14[17], an update 
to portage to permit security upgrades to be identified and emerged. 

 17. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0014.html
 
Marius uses a fairly prosaic Athon-XP 2600+ desktop, as well as a P2 266 
that has been converted for use as a router/server and an aging P3 Celeron 
1133 Laptop. He is currently using XFCE4[18] on the Desktop and Gnome[19] 
on the Laptop, but isn't particularly partisan about any WM. In addition 
to Sylpheed-Claws, he usually starts gaim[20], xchat[21], firefox[22] and 
xmms[23] or motv[24] shortly after booting a machine.

Marius lives in Germany, where he is studying Computer Science at the 
University of Bremen. He enjoys role-playing (although he has little 
opportunity to do so at the moment) as well as biking and watching 
Football. He is particularly pleased that Werder Bremen[25] won the double 
this year. He confesses to having recently renewed a video-game addiction 
for which he is not seeking treatment. He is a Babylon 5 fan, offering a 
line from the character G'Kar as a favorite: "No dictator, no invader can 
hold an imprisoned population by force of arms forever. There is no 
greater power in the universe than the need for freedom. Against that 
power, governments and tyrants and armies cannot stand." Marius concluded 
by saying that "Gentoo is like a Vorlon: mysterious but very powerful."

GNUstep Guerilla 
 
GNUstep, the notoriously underestimated project, is not just the umptienth 
funny way of managing your desktop. What's more interesting is the 
development environment it provides for compiling Mac OS X (Cocoa) 
applications for use on an x86 Linux platform. To reflect the progress 
that GNUstep has made over the past few months, Forum user fafhrd[26] 
seems to have found his calling: Unconvinced by the current state of the 
GNUstep ebuilds in Portage, he decided to write some of his own, ended up 
posting a dozen new bugs and getting feedback from a number of people 
adventurous enough to try them out:

Yahoo Changes Affect Gentoo Users 
 
Earlier this week, Yahoo changed the protocol used in their Instant 
Messaging client. Two popular message clients, Kopete and GAIM, were both 
affected[29].

Italy: MOCA Hacker Camp in Pescara, 20-22 August 2004 
 
Italian geeks have known Metro Olografix[31] as an organisation of mailbox 
admins and bulletin board system hackers from the Fido realm who got 
together ten years ago in an effort to fight against police intervention 
in running their BBSs. To commemorate the anniversay, the Metro Olografix 
Camp (MOCA)[32] will be organised during the third weekend in August, in 
the city of Pescara. The MOCA is a hacker camp designed after the famous 
Chaos Computer Club summer camps in Germany, with workshops and 
friendliness and sports for nerds. Gentoo developer Luca Barbato[33] 
currently drumming up a posse to join him at the camp knows what he's 
talking about - he's already been to the CCC camps... You don't want to 
miss this, the MOCA site is set in one of the most spectacular landscapes 
of Italy, underneath the Abruzzian hills and right on the Adriatic 
waterfront. If you haven't planned your summer holiday yet, here's the 
perfect place. Check the Italian forum thread[34] for details.

Central Europe: Gentoo User Map Revisited 
 
About a year ago, German Gentoo developers came up with the idea of 
representing users as little red dots on a map of the country. 
Unfortunately, the old site disappeared along with the entries of 
everybody who had already entered their location data. Now the interactive 
map of the geographical Gentoo user distribution in and around Germany has 
been brought back, stable and easily usable, and on a server that's 
unlikely to disappear any time soon. If you're a Gentoo user within the 
area covered on this map (which is much larger than Germany, including all 
of the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland, together 
with most of Belgium, Poland, and Slovakia, and parts of Italy and 
France), make yourself visible here[35]. Even if you don't know a word of 
German, the instructions should be fairly easy to follow: Just enter your 
coordinates, name and email address.

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
   
Finding recent files with ls and 'FlAt'
 
A quick way to find recently changed files is to pass the -FlAt flags to 
ls. Combined with head, this command can give you a quick overview of 
recently modified files in a directory. The -F option distinguishes 
certain types of files and directories by adding extra characters (such as 
'/' for directories, '*' for executables, etc.). The -t option sorts the 
entries by the date they were last modified. Piping the output to head 
shows (by default) only 10 entries.
