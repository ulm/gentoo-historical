      <title>Portage 2.1 Released</title>
      <body>
        <p>After many months in development, the Portage team has released
        Portage-2.1. This new release sees a great many new features, fixed
        bugs, and performance improvements. A detailed description of changes
        can be found in the 
        <uri link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/portage/main/trunk/RELEASE-NOTES?view=markup">
        release notes</uri> and 
        <uri link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/portage/main/trunk/NEWS?view=markup">
        NEWS file</uri>. Some highlights, however, are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <b>confcache integration</b>: In combination with the 
          <path>dev-util/confcache</path>package, users can now benefit from
          cached configure checks, speeding up build times for many
          packages.</li>
          <li>
          <b>New cache framework</b>: The Portage cache has been completely
          overhauled, leading to massive speed improvements when updating cache
          after sync, as well as in other areas.</li>
          <li>
          <b>New elog functionality</b>: In the past, important messages from
          ebuilds were delivered by means of the <c>einfo</c>, <c>ewarn</c>, and
          <c>eerror</c> functions, which print messages to the standard output.
          However, in a length multi-package merge, it is very easy for these
          messages to get lost. The new <c>elog</c> function allows them to be
          collected in one place for later inspection, and should greatly ease
          the process of upgrading many packages at one time.</li>
          <li>
          <b>New hooks framework</b>: Using <path>/etc/portage/bashrc</path>,
          users can now define bash functions to be executed before and after
          any given ebuild phase. This can be used to make almost arbitrary
          customisations to the build environment, and is a powerful tool for
          those who need functionality or behaviour that stock Portage cannot
          provide.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Digest improvements</b>: Portage can now use SHA256 and RMD160
          digests in addition to MD5 for checking the integrity of downloaded
          files. This release also introduces support for a new Manifest2
          format that should allow the current Manifest and digest-* files to
          be unified into one much more efficient file format.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Improved debugging support</b>: using FEATURES="splitdebug" it is
          now possible to keep the performance improvements from using stripped
          binaries, while still having the debug information around on disk
          should it be needed. This should make filing useful bug reports much
          easier.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Colour remappings</b>: Using the 
          <path>/etc/portage/color.map</path> file, you can now remap the
          colours that Portage will use in its output. Have you ever wanted a
          pretty pink portage? Well now you can, without having to change the
          source code.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Configuration improvements</b>: Certain config files can now be
          made into directories, for easier management (for example, 
          <path>/etc/portage/package.unmask/kde</path>, 
          <path>/etc/portage/package.unmask/xorg</path> will be combined to make
          the old <path>/etc/portage/package.unmask</path>). 
          <path>/etc/portage</path>itself can also be loaded from different
          locations, making certain tasks much simpler.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Various other improvements</b>: Certain types of binary security
          issues can now be fixed automatically. The initial import of the
          Portage module should now be faster in certain circumstances, meaning
          that external scripts which import it should see speed improvements.
          Emerge now supports a -q or 'really quiet mode' option, reducing its
          output to a minimum.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is a stabilisation 
        <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136198">
        bug</uri> open, where you can track the progress of this new release
        towards the stable tree. As of this writing, stable users on x86,
        Sparc, HPPA and PPC platforms can use the new release; other
        architecture teams should be following in the near future.</p>

        <mail link="solar@gentoo.org">Ned Ludd</mail> for taking the time to

      <title>Status report: Gentoo/Alpha</title>
      <body>
        <p>The Gentoo/Alpha team is responsible for making sure that Gentoo
        runs smoothly on the Alpha architecture. The team has recently grown to
        include 
        <mail link="tcort@gentoo.org">Thomas Cort</mail> and 
        <mail link="christel@gentoo.org">Christel Dahlskjaer</mail>. In the
        past few months we have been very productive. 
        <mail link="spb@gentoo.org">Stephen Bennett</mail> has continued his
        work with SELinux. hardened-sources is now keyworded for alpha. Thanks
        to the work of 
        <mail link="stefaan@gentoo.org">Stefaan De Roeck</mail>and others,
        modular X has been keyworded and is working well. The Gentoo/Alpha team
        is also pleased to announce that we have stabilized gnome-2.12.3 and
        kde-3.5.2.</p>
        <p>Thomas Cort has produced two documents, the Alpha Porting Guide and
        the Gentoo/Alpha FAQ. A guide to using the SRM console is on the way. 
        <mail link="yoswink@gentoo.org">Jose Luis Rivero</mail>, 
        <mail link="ferdy@egntoo.org">Fernando Pereda</mail>, and the rest of
        the Gentoo/Alpha team completely revamped the project page. Fernando
        Pereda has also been busy setting up the Alpha Arch Testers project. If

      <title>Tetex changes</title>
      <body>
        <p>Tetex's upstream maintainer Thomas Esser hass announced that he
        won't make any further tetex releases. This will have some mid- to
        long-term effects on how tetex is maintained in Gentoo.  Gentoo
        developer <mail link="ehmsen@gentoo.org">Martin Ehmsen</mail> shows the
        possible methods for handling this – while it seems to be undecided for
        now how to proceed there will be changes in the future.  Stay tuned…

      <title>The shadow and pam-login conflict</title>
      <body>
        <p>Many users may have seen that new versions of pam-login and shadow
        block each other. The reason for that is that the file
        <path>/bin/login</path> used to be provided by pam-login for mostly
        historical reasons. Now shadow 4.0 started also providing this file, to
        reduce confusion this file is now provided by shadow. Also the rest of
        pam-login has been folded into shadow too, so when you see these two
        packages blocking each other please unmerge pam-login and emerge the
        updated shadow package in its place.</p>

      <title>Ukrainian IRC channels</title>
      <body>
        <p>The relatively new and still small Ukrainian Gentoo community has
        opened an official IRC channel: <c>#gentoo-ua</c> channel on
        irc.freenode.net.  If you want to discuss all thing Gentoo in Ukrainian
        or want to help in the localization effort just join the team around
        <mail link="george@gentoo.org">George Shapovalov</mail>.  For now there
        is no Ukrainian Subforum, but if that community continues to grow that
        is a distinct possibility – for now "Other languages" is the correct
        forum for Ukrainian questions.</p>

      <title>Gentoo Women</title>
      <body>
        <p>Geek girls are almost the stuff of legend. Women make up only 30% of
        regular computer users, and as little as 2% of Linux users.</p>
        <p>But why should this be the case? The reason for this can be as
        elusive as the Linux-using women themselves – for every survey or
        paper saying that they are not given the same chances or opportunities,
        there is another one saying exactly the opposite. Lost in the midst of
        all this controversy, however, is the fact that little if anything is
        being done to interest women in computing, in Linux, or in Gentoo.</p>
        <p>Groups such as the Debian project are seeking to change that. Debian
        Women, founded in 2004, was set up to encourage women to become more
        involved with Linux. The group maintains an IRC channel and a mailing
        list for the discussion of technical issues, as well as maintaining a
        public presence at Linux-related conferences and events. They also run
        an extensive mentoring program whereby women are paired up with a
        mentor who will spend the time to help them find answers to their
        questions, and get to know the distribution, as well as the community
        and Linux in general. This mentoring program adds a personal element to
        the process, and helps to guide people towards working more effectively
        with Linux. Unfortunately though, as the name implies, their efforts
        focus very much on encouraging their members to use Debian.</p>
        <p>The idea was recently floated of starting a similar project for the
        women of Gentoo, and we would like your thoughts on the matter. Would
        such a project be welcome within the community, and would people take
        advantage of it? What would you like to see the project do, and how?
        Would you volunteer your time and/or money to encourage people, not
        just women, to use Gentoo, and to mentor and help users?</p>
        <p>All groups, regardless of their origins, need 'fresh blood' to
        survive – members will inevitably depart, and without a steady stream
        of people joining the group will diminish with time. If we do not reach
        out to the community, we miss out on a lot of good ideas and talented
        people that are out there. Let's make the effort to do so, rather than
        wallowing in complacency and resisting any change.</p>

      <title>Summer of Code -- One Month Along</title>
      <body>
        <p>It's a month now since the start of this year's Summer of Code, and
        Gentoo's projects have been progressing rapidly. Our students have been
        hard at work with their projects, and making good progress. The Summer
        of Code was originally mentioned 
        <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20060501-newsletter.xml#doc_chap1">
        in the GWN of May 1st.</uri>. If you are interested to know what all the
        fuss is about, read on.</p>
        <p>The <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc">Summer of Code</uri>, now
        in its second year, is a program run by Google which sponsors students
        to work on open source projects during the summer holidays. Last year's
        program was a great success, with a long list of 
        <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc-results.html">
        results</uri> including some great projects. This year's version is even
        bigger, containing over twice as many mentoring organisations, and a
        list of student projects to match.</p>
        <p>This year Gentoo is participating as a mentoring organisation, and
        we were lucky enough to be allocated 14 projects, including this year's
        most in-demand student – Anant Narayanan had applications accepted by
        a total of 4 organisations, and chose to work with us rather than any
        of the others. For a while it was uncertain whether we would be
        accepted, given the number of other Linux distributions and operating
        systems already accepted, but we were eventually chosen, and allocated
        a higher than normal number of projects.</p>
        <p>"I like how Gentoo has built a community around the distro in such a
        short time. To me, that is emblematic of a good community, and is what
        SoC needs for mentoring great OSS developers" said Greg Stein from
        Google, talking about why he chose to accept Gentoo over other projects
        on the hold list. "As one example, Gentoo got included into the program
        because I've liked how they came from pretty much nowhere into one of
        the stronger Linux distributions. Out of the thousand distros out
        there, they rose to one of the primaries in pretty short order. I
        believe that is due to a strong community focus, which is exactly
        something that I believe is good for an SoC organization."</p>
        <p>A full list of Gentoo's accepted applications with some basic
        information can be found at 
        <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/gentoo/about.html">Google's
        Gentoo page</uri>; more updates about many of the projects can be found
        on the students' blogs, which are aggregated as part of 
        <uri link="http://planet.gentoo.org">Planet Gentoo</uri> as well as
        making up 
        <uri link="http://planet.gentoo.org/soc/">Planet Gentoo SoC</uri>.
        However, we would like to highlight a few individual projects here,
        with some more information about the projects and their current
        status.</p>
        <p>
        <uri link="http://www.pioto.org/~pioto/gentoo/soc2006/blog/">Michael
        Kelly</uri>has been working on a unified user/group management
        framework, with the intention of integrating it into package managers
        and the Gentoo tree to provide an implementation of 
        <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0027.html">GLEP
        27</uri>, which was approved long ago but has not yet been implemented.
        His code can be found in his public Subversion repository, accessible
        through the web with 
        <uri link="http://svn.pioto.org/viewvc">ViewVC</uri>. As his initial 
        <uri link="http://svn.pioto.org/viewvc/glep27-proposal.txt?view=co">
        proposal</uri> outlines, this should provide some great improvements in
        the way user and group accounts are handled by ebuilds – the current
        system, while it works in the vast majority of cases, is relatively
        limited in its capability and scalability. The code seems to be
        progressing nicely, and when finished should provide a simple,
        flexible, and portable means to manage users and groups in package
        managers and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>
        <uri link="http://unleashed.amule.org/soc/">Alex Martinez</uri>has been
        working on porting Gentoo's "sandbox" utility to run on FreeBSD
        systems. The 
        <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/bsd/index.xml">
        Gentoo/*BSD project</uri> has been increasingly active in recent months,
        and is rapidly becoming a viable platform for real-world use. However,
        due to differences between the FreeBSD and GNU C libraries, the sandbox
        utility, used primarily for ebuild QA purposes, still does not work
        properly. Alex's SoC project sets out to change this, and involves
        looking into the most fundamental libraries on the system to find out
        just what is causing the problems. While the project is currently on
        hold due to the exam season, progress just before this was extremely
        promising. When completed, this should bring the various Gentoo/*BSD
        ports much closer to having all the package management functionality
        available on Gentoo Linux, a major milestone in their development.</p>
        <p>All in all, the Summer of Code is a fantastic opportunity for
        students to get more involved in their favourite open source projects
        and to let them spend the summer doing what they enjoy without
        hindrance. Of course, it also provides the projects with some great
        code that perhaps would not have been written otherwise, as well as a
        fruitful source of potential new contributors. This sentiment was
        echoed by Christel Dahlskjaer, Gentoo's administrative contact for the
        summer of code, talking to the GWN earlier this month: "I am doing my
        best to ensure that we give the students the support they need, we also
        aim to make these summer months a time of fun for them and we hope that
        at the end of their 'internship' they'll not only have provided us with
        contributions in form of code, but will hopefully have decided that
        they want to come on board and work on Gentoo as developers."</p>

        following the handbook. How do you think the quality of Gentoo
        documentation could be improved so that mistakes are less prone to
        happening?</p>

          <b>GLEP 49 - take 2</b>
        </p>
        <p>After the long discussion about alternative package managers in the
        last weeks 
        <mail link="pauldv@gentoo.org">Paul de Vrieze</mail> and 
        <mail link="g2boojum@gentoo.org">Grant Goodyear</mail> offer two
        competing GLEPs for discussion that define the capabilities, license
        and other managerial issues that a package manager has to offer to be
        supported. This might focus future discussions about portage
        replacements on technical instead of social issues.</p>

        <p>Every now and then a security problem is found. When this affects a
        Gentoo package a GLSA is released, but until now the affected packages
        were not directly unkeyworded or removed from the tree. This leaves
        some vulnerable ebuilds in place, so 
        <mail link="solar@gentoo.org">Ned Ludd</mail> in cooperation with 
        <mail link="ferringb@gmail.com">Brian Harring</mail> has started a
        cleanup of the tree. This should not affect users, only vulnerable,
        insecure and unmaintained ebuilds will be removed.</p>

      <title>Searching the portage tree with eix</title>
      <body>
        <p>
        <c>eix</c> is a handy utility that indexes your portage tree and quickly
        searches it. The latest stable version, 0.55, is also compatible with
        Portage 2.1's new metadata backend.</p>
        <p>To get started, emerge the package, and then build your index:</p>
<pre caption="Installing eix">
# <i>emerge eix</i>
# <i>update-eix</i>
</pre>
        <p>
        <c>update-eix</c >will index your ebuilds in your
        <c>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</c> in addition to the main portage tree.</p>
        <p>Once finished you are ready to do some searches. Use <c>eix foo</c>
        to search for a package, or <c>eix -S bar</c> to search package
        descriptions. To search for a specific package, use 
        <c>eix -e packagename</c>. You can also use regular expressions in your
        search parameters by default.</p>
        <p>The output of <c>eix</c> displays each package version available.
        Versions prefixed with <c>~</c> are marked unstable, while
        <c>!</c>indicates the version is hard masked.</p>

        <p>Finally, one last tip. If you want to run <c>emerge --sync</c> and
