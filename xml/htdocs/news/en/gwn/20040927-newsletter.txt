   Gentoo Documentation Revisited

   The first thing many visitors to the Gentoo website will notice when
   opening the [3]Gentoo Handbook or any other piece of documentation
   these days, is a little "Print" link sitting topmost on the right
   column: Bowing to long-standing popular requests, [4]Xavier Neys has
   now implemented a simple way of viewing a printer-friendly version of
   Gentoo documentation, and eventually putting it to paper.

   Other changes to the Handbook include a info about Gentoo's SLOT
   handling for packages, an explanation of the reasons for package
   masking (and how to circumvent it, if need be), and a reinstatement of
   the manual GRUB installation requested by many users. And some
   additional documentation has been added last month, too: [5]Dennis
   Niehüser has contributed a very nice document on [6]power management
   for laptops, with tips on setting up CPU frequency scaling, a walk
   through display, disk, and battery power management features, and last
   but not least a section on sleep states that answers questions many
   people are too polite to ask. For Gentoo users who want to set up
   their own Internet radio station, [7]Streaming Radio with SHOUTcast is
   an excellent new guide by [8]Chris White that leads through each step
   of configuring the server and the network, together with loads of
   information on optimizing the service for different uses, get
   transcoding for locally stored MP3s to work and much more. [9]Benny
   Chuang has corrected the language directories for documentation to
   reflect variants of languages (e.g. Chinese, Portuguese), and
   [10]Steven McCoy has added a achapter on PAM authentication to the
   OpenAFS guide.

   The Gentoo Documentation Project has put up a [11]roadmap document,
   featuring all items on the agenda that need immediate fixing. If you
   want to help, get involved by subscribing to the [12]documentation
   project mailing list.

   New GWN Section: Gentoo in the Press

   Starting this week, the GWN carries a new section referencing
   publications that have written about Gentoo. It is likely to have an
   irregular publication schedule, since we don't expect to find
   something to point you to each week, but will gladly accept any hints
   from our readers: If you happen to know of an article in a magazine,
   or even TV or radio coverage of Gentoo Linux, please tell us! The
   original language of the publication is unimportant, just write a
   short description of the article's content and send it to
   [13]gwn-feedback@gentoo.org, together with a link to the publisher's
   website, and possibly a scan of the article (if it isn't available
   online). Thanks a lot, and enjoy reading the first installment of
   Gentoo in the Press, just below our International News section.

   Portage 2.0.51_rc1 Trials and Tribulations

   The new Portage version is rippling the surface of more than one forum
   these days. Check for new features, bugs, and bugs that really are
   features at one of the threads below:

   Alsa and the 2.6 Kernel

   Upgrading to the 2.6 kernel series brings a lot of benefits. Better
   performance under load, a simplified compilation process, and ALSA
   sound drivers included in the kernel. List contributor Greg wondered
   if after upgrading the user-land ALSA headers and libraries were
   necessary. Check the thread to find out!

   Hardened Toolchain Reorganization

   Solar had previously announced that the hardened toolchain might be
   dropped, but reconsidered when many developers and users gave very
   positive feedback. As it stands now, the Gentoo Hardened subproject
   does not have the manpower to do everything at once, so every bit of
   support, especially with bug hunting and fixing is wanted.
     * [30]Hardened Toolchain

   Stack-smash protection by default?

   This long and controversial thread was started upon someone asking a
   rather innocent question: Shouldn't Gentoo offer stack-smash
   protection ("-fstack-protector" CFLAG) by default, since most
   vulnerabilities are still buffer overflows? Stack-smash protection can
   adversely affect performance, it offers protection against a class of
   exploits, enabling it may protect users, at little extra cost.
     * [31]Stack Smash Protection

   USE="acl" Likely to Be Removed from Profiles

   All profiles and stage2 / stage3 set USE="acl", but most users will
   not need it, and some complications may happen during install.
   Therefore this flag has been removed from the 2004.3 x86 profile; most
   likely the other profiles will do the same.
     * [32]USE="acl" Dropped

   Moving /usr/qt and /usr/kde for Better FHS Compliance?

   The FHS (File Hierarchy Standard) defines default locations for most
   files in a linux system. Is the Gentoo strategy of using /usr/qt/x.y
   and /usr/kde/x.y to allow different KDE and QT versions to coexist a
   violation of the FHS?

   and Jochen Maes (SeJo), have announced their presence at the

   September, bringing the number of participants to double digits (from
   almost as many different countries). You can still register for this
   event at Kransberg Castle (near Frankfurt am Main) with [37]Ulrich

   5. Gentoo in the Press

   Linux Gazette: September 2004 (issue no. 106)

   Mike Orr (aka Sluggo) wrote an article about [38]Installing Gentoo -
   "still my favourite distro" - for this month's Linux Gazette. He
   describes the installation process of a desktop system on two
   different PCs, both dual-booting Windows, one Pentium III with 1 GHz
   and a brandnew 2.6 GHz Pentium4 with two monitors.

   Linux+ 02/2004 (September 2004)

   This month the [39]Polish quarterly magazine Linux+ (also distributed
   in German and Czech versions) comes bundled with two DVDs, one of
   which has Gentoo Linux 2004.1 for x86 on it. The printed edition
   includes an article describing the installation from DVD, limited to
   the most basic system install. The official handbook and additional
   installation guides can always be found at the [40]Gentoo website.

   7. Tips and Tricks

   Roaming network profiles for Laptops with Quickswitch

   Every Laptop user knows what I am talking about by saying that
   switching network profiles is a real problem and hard to keep track of
   when doing it manually. This is where [77]Quickswitch comes in.
   Quickswitch is a utility that not only makes laptop users' everyday
   life easier by letting them create and use roaming network profiles,
   but it also has built-in support for multiple network cards, wireless
   LAN configurations, different kernel parameters, support for X
   configurations, Netscape preferences, Samba shares and so on and so
   forth.

   Sounds good? Want to learn how to use it? Read on:

   Code Listing 7.1: Installing Quickswitch
   # emerge quickswitch

   Now we need to tell quickswitch about all the network settings we want
   to be able to switch to. Quickswitch can be configured using it
   configuration file in /etc/quickswitch/switchto.conf. There is also a
   sample configuration in /etc/quickswitch/switchto.conf.sample.

   Code Listing 7.2: Setting up the quickswitch configuration in
   /etc/quickswitch/switchto.conf
// # This is the default configuration:
[config]
device=eth0
// # Path to save last known good configuration...
servicefilename=/etc/quickswitch/switchto.last

// # This is our profile called "home":
[home]
description=home
address=192.168.0.25
netmask=255.255.255.0
gateway=192.168.0.1
dns1=195.62.99.42
dns2=195.62.97.177

// # This is our profile called "work":
[work]
description=work
address=10.16.3.114
netmask=255.255.255.0
gateway=10.16.3.249
dns1=195.62.99.42

   We are finished with the configuration now. Let's test if it works.

   Code Listing 7.3: Using switchto to switch to another profile
// Switch to "work" profile:
# switchto work
// Switch to "home" profile:
# switchto home

   Use ifconfig and route to make sure that switchto correctly applied
   the settings the first time. Everythings ok? Well done!

   Quickswitch offers two more ways of how to switch your profile.
    1. switcher is a simple curses based GUI to switch between your
       profiles.
    2. [78]TraySwitcher is a more sophisticated Gnome tray applet.

   To learn how Quickswitch easily lets you create profiles that also
   switch Samba, X configurations and even more. Take a look at the well
   documented /etc/quickswitch/switchto.conf.sample sample configuration
   file and visit the [79]Quickswitch project homepage.
