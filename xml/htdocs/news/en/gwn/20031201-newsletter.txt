Gentoo Documentation Project looking for more translators
---------------------------------------------------------
  
the Gentoo Documentation Project[1] (GDP) is looking for more translators 
to aid the current translation efforts. As documentation is actively 
maintained and updated, keeping the translations up to date is important 
but timeconsuming if not enough translators are available. 

 1. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp
 
To improve the translation efforts, the GDP is looking for additional 
translators for several languages. If you are interested to join the 
translation team, please contact the translation lead.

Praise for Gentoo in Linux Weekly News
--------------------------------------
  When you know it's coming from the right person a simple appreciative 
nod of the head can be very flattering. now Ladislav Bodnar, the man 
behind distrowatch[9] and the only soul on the planet to actually know all 
linux distributions available in the past, present and future, has written 
some outright praise for Gentoo Linux. His article titled "The Success of 
Gentoo"[9] makes Gentoo devs, helpers, forum administrators and power 
users blush to the point of sporting a big, bright crimson complexion. 
Thanks to D.M.D. Ljungmark[9] for pointing us to this article that 
appeared on the LWN on November 19th.

This week, we are featuring Chris PeBenito[10] (pebenito), the lead for 
the SELinux sub-project for Hardened Gentoo[11], as well as the lead for 
the recently re-initialized Embedded Gentoo[12] project. He has been 
responsible for maintaining the SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) userland 
utilities and patches, sys-kernel/selinux-sources, and SELinux policies. 
He also manages the SELinux demo machine[13]. Finally, he has recently 
taken a lead role in re-activating the dormant Embedded Gentoo project and 
is currently hard at work recruiting help, organizing sub-projects and 
discussing priorities. Interested parties are invited to hang out on the 
gentoo-embedded IRC channel and subscribe to the mailing list.

Chris first started using Linux with Slackware in 1997. He later switched 
to Red Hat, and was considering Sorcerer because it was source-based when 
he heard about Gentoo's packaging system and decided to try it. After 
taking note of the noticeably better performance on his P200 MMX server, 
he was sold. Earlier this year, Chris responded to a request for help from 
Joshua Brindle[14](method) by reading and digesting the NSA's white paper 
on SELinux and then helping to get the packages in order. He was named a 
developer and handed responsibility for the sub-project. One of the 
brightest experiences from that has been the SELinux demo server 
demonstrating its stability during an early slashdotting. He offers a 
cookie to anyone who can crack (not DoS) it. 

 7. method@gentoo.org
 
Chris usually works on a dual p3-450 workstation, and tests on a pair of 
SELinux servers: a K6-2/400 and a G3/500 clone. He enjoys listening to and 
playing music, and has played soprano and bass clarinet for many years. 
His favorite quote is from the Buddha: "As irrigators lead water where 
they want, as archers make their arrows straight, as carpenters carve 
wood, the wise shape their minds" 
 
Chris is currently a Master's candidate and Research Assistant in Computer 
Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. His primary research 
and career interests lie in embedded systems and hardware design. He 
expects to be completing his studies next spring. He describes Gentoo as 
"polymorphic; from the same portage tree you can get an embedded system, a 
desktop or a server. What will we come up with next?"

 * GLSA: ethereal 
 * GLSA: glibc 
 * GLSA: libnids 
 * GLSA: phpsysinfo 
 * New Security Bug Reports 
   
GLSA: ethereal
--------------
  
Quote from http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00011.html:
 
Potential security issues have been discovered in the following protocol 
dissectors:
 
 * An improperly formatted GTP MSISDN string could cause a buffer 
overflow. 
 * A malformed ISAKMP or MEGACO packet could make Ethereal or Tethereal 
crash. 
 * The SOCKS dissector was susceptible to a heap overlfow. 
 
Impact:
 
It may be possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code by 
injecting a purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, or by convincing 
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
 
 * Severity: Normal 
 * Packages Affected: <0.9.16 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge '>=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.9.16'; 
emerge clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[15] 
 15. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.announce/267

    
GLSA: glibc
-----------
  
A bug in the getgrouplist function can cause a buffer overflow if the size 
of the group list is too small to hold all the user's groups. This 
overflow can cause segmentation faults in user applications. This 
vulnerability exists only when an administrator has placed a user in a 
number of groups larger than that expected by an application. 
 
 * Severity: Normal 
 * Packages Affected: <=2.2.4 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge '>=sys-libs/glibc-2.2.5'; emerge 
clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[16] 
 16. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.announce/268

    
GLSA: libnids
-------------
  
There is a bug in the part of libnids code responsible for TCP reassembly. 
The flaw probably allows remote code execution.
 
 * Severity: Normal 
 * Packages Affected: <=1.17 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge '>=net-libs/libnids-1.18'; emerge 
clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[17] 
 17. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.announce/269

    
GLSA: phpsysinfo
----------------
  
phpSysInfo contains two vulnerabilities which could allow local files to 
be read or arbitrary PHP code to be executed, under the privileges of the 
web server process.
 
 * Severity: Normal 
 * Packages Affected: <=2.1 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge '>=dev-php/phpsysinfo-2.1-r1'; 
emerge clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[18]

Gnome 2.5 Hits the Ground Running
 
Sudden flurry of activity at the Desktop Environment section of the forum. 
After KDE 3.2, Keith Packard's new X server and other excitements of the 
past weeks, Gnome friends finally have had an opportunity to retaliate. 
Gnome 2.5 was released on Saturday, and the corresponding Forum thread is 
mightily pleased, albeit fiddling with minor issues concerning things that 
build less well than others... For the user who doesn't mind a bit of 
risk, breakmygentoo.net has unofficial ebuilds (if you find bugs in these, 
please send them to breakmygentoo.net, not to bugzilla.gentoo.org).

New USE flag
 
With its continual strive to increase the amount of choice users have in 
Gentoo it's not suprising that new USE flags are being proposed all the 
time. Here[28] is the most recent one: accessibility. Check it out.

Japan: 2nd Gentoo Appearance at the Internet Week 2003 in Yokohama
 
The "BSD/Linux Day" is an all-day event, traditionally embedded in the 
annual gathering of Internauts in Japan, the Internet Week[32] at 
Yokohama's Pacifico Conference Centre. In what amounts to a fledgling 
tradition of its own, Gentoo is going to be represented by GentooJP 
activists, just like last year[33]. This time Mamoru Komachi will give an 
introduction to Gentoo Linux during the first session of the day, and on 
top of the presentation (and the rather interesting conference 
program)[34], Gentooists on the Japanese mailing list have been busy 
organising some apres-speech gathering, possibly with drinks and whatever 
else one does in Yokohama after dark. This annual Japan Unix Society[35] 
meeting is going to be held on December 2nd, from 9:00 to 17:00, and has a 
price tag of 3000 JPY per person, subject to rebates available for JUS 
members and students. You may want to send an email to the Japanese Gentoo 
mailing list[36] to announce your intentions of showing up...

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
ANSI Escape Sequences: Colors
 
This week's tip shows the colors available as ANSI escape sequences. These 
can be used to beautify terminal prompts, text, or anything else that 
understands ANSI escape sequences.
 
ANSI escape sequences are non-printed text that is interpreted to change 
the format of some text. In this example, we will specifically look at the 
use of escape sequences to specify colors. In the standard Gentoo 
/etc/profile, there are some examples of these colors already being used 
to change the color of parts of the terminal prompt. For example, the 
pathname appears in blue and parts of the bash prompt show up in red or 
green depending on whether you are root or a normal user.
 
Non-printable ANSI escape sequences are always enclosed \[\033[ and \]. 
Colors must be followed by a m. Using the example from /etc/profile, we 
can see that the color code for green is 32, the code for blue is 34, and 
the code for red is 31.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 7.1:                                                       |
| PS1 from /etc/profile                                                   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|root user                                                                |
|export PS1='\[\033[01;31m\]\h \[\033[01;34m\]\W \$ \[\033[00m\]'         |
|                      red               blue                             |
|normal user                                                              |
|export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h \[\033[01;34m\]\W \$ \[\033[00m\]'      |
|                      green                blue                          |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The next part is the 1 preceding the actual color code. This indicates 
whether or not the color should be bold or not (0 for normal, 1 for bold). 
So if you wanted a normal green instead of a bold green, you would use 
00;32m instead of 01;32m.
 
Note: This does not work with all colors. See the list at the bottom for a 
list of what's available in bold.
 
For background colors you would 4x instead of 3x. So to have the 
background blue instead of the text, you could use 00;44m instead of 
01;34m.
 
Here is a list of colors and their escape sequences.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                                                                         |

|    Red        0;31       Bold Red     1;31                              |
|    Green      0;32       Bold Green   1;32                              |
|    Yellow     0;33       Bold Yellow  1;33                              |
|    Blue       0;34       Bold Blue    1;34                              |
|    Purple     0;35       Bold Purple  1;35                              |
|    Cyan       0;36       Bold Cyan    1;36                              |
|    Light Gray 0;37       White        1;37                              |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Note: ANSI sequence 0;33 is listed as Brown in the BASH-Prompt HOWTO, but 
it seems more of a mustard yellow. Strictly speaking, the bold version of 
it is indeed yellow - therefore I've listed it as yellow.
 
Also, if you're scared of these escape sequences but want to add color to 
shell scripts, check out app-misc/color.
