<title>FOSDEM coming up: Europe's main Gentoo event</title>
<body>
<p>
Thirty developers have already confirmed their attendance at next month's 
<uri link="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</uri>, Europe's largest open-source 
conference and the most important event in the European Gentoo calendar,
to be held in Brussels. Last year saw the first "dev room" reservation for Gentoo, 
an entire day and lecture hall completely devoted to Gentoo use and development, 
with an embedded Gentoo developers-only meeting that initiated the metastructure 
changes implemented over the last year. FOSDEM 2006 again opens on the last weekend 
of February, Saturday 25 and Sunday 26, with the Gentoo dev room on the second day 
and a preliminary schedule already in place. If you plan on attending FOSDEM and 
need help in finding accomodation in Brussels, please contact <mail link="patrick@gentoo.org">Patrick Lauer</mail> who coordinates this year's Gentoo presence at FOSDEM. Especially if 
you want to fill one of the last remaining time slots and grace the dev room with a 
Gentoo presentation!

<title>Lithuanian translators needed</title>
<body>
<p>
A small team around <mail link="e.liubarskij@gmail.com">Ernestas Liubarskij</mail> 
has recently started translating the Gentoo documentation into the Lithuanian 
language (ISO code: lt). They need many more contributors to help with this effort, 
so if you can read English, write Lithuanian, and would like to join the team, 
please contact Ernestas directly.

<title>"I'm an open-source guy with an open mind" -- Andrea Barisani</title>
<body>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20060109_lcars.jpg"
short="lcars" caption="Andrea Barisani a.k.a. lcars"/>
<p>
<mail link="lcars@gentoo.org">Andrea Barisani</mail> hails from the 
beautiful Italian city of Trieste. While still trying to finish his 
degree in physics, he also runs a company - <uri 
link="http://www.inversepath.com">InversePath</uri> - together with fellow 
Gentoo developer <mail link="tigger@gentoo.org">Rob Holland</mail>.
</p>
<p>
During his first year at the university, Andrea discovered his interest
in system administration and security. At the university, he deployed one
of the earliest documented production Gentoo servers. From bugreports
and patches he became more and more involved with Gentoo. The Gentoo
environment still exists at the University, along with <path>rsync1.it.gentoo.org</path> 
and <path>lists.gentoo.org</path>, both managed by Andrea. Other Gentoo 
duties include the LDAP setup, general infrastructure work, managing the 
mailing lists and being the security liaison for the Infrastructure project. 
Upstream <c>mlmmj</c> (the mailinglist software) benefits from many patches 
Andrea created while adapting and bugfixing the package to make it work 
for Gentoo. Additionally many LDAP-related packages, <c>sendmail</c>, 
<c>ftester</c> (firewall testing tool) and <c>tenshi</c> (log analyzer) 
are among the packages he maintains.
</p>
<p>
Andrea has deployed Gentoo on a wide range of systems whenever appropriate -- 
firewalls, clusters, generic servers... Amazingly the "KDE or GNOME?" question 
draws a blank from him -- Andrea is a text-mode addict, powered by <c>ssh</c>, 
<c>screen</c>, <c>mutt</c>, <c>vim</c> and <c>subversion</c>. Only in rare 
cases does X even get started, and then only for <c>firefox</c> or Openoffice. 
He manages 50 workstations and six servers  at the university, among other 
things, which more than compensates for the comparatively modest machine park 
of only a few generic x86 computers he keeps at home.
</p>
<p>
Andrea is not strictly bound to Linux, as he says, "the world is big and
we have good software for many different things" -- while Linux
usually has the most features it often lacks the consistency of the BSD
projects, so he uses whatever works best. "You can see the benefits of a
more controlled bazaar in BSD, and you can see the benefits of a huge
bazaar in GNU|Whatever/Linux distros," he states.
</p>
<p>
Some people may remember the "rsync compromise" some time ago when an
exploit in the <c>rsync</c> code was abused to take over servers -- Andrea 
was one of the first to fully diagnose the exploit. This exploit also showed
the power of open-source development -- within 36 hours the bugs were fixed 
and a new <c>rsync</c> release was out. An interview about that incident can 
be found in <uri link="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=4928&amp;t=technology">Harvard 
Business Review</uri>, a short biography of Andrea and more personal info are 
available at the <uri link="http://www.inversepath.com/staff.html">InversePath 
website</uri> and the <uri link="http://pacsec.jp/speakers.html?LANG=ENGLISH">speakers 
pages</uri> of last year's PacSec conference in Yokohama that Andrea attended.

<p><b>Textrels in packages policy</b></p>
<p>
<mail link="halcy0n@gentoo.org">Mark Loeser</mail> started a nice
technical discussion about textrels. Portage does warn about textrels as
they can lead to performance and security problems - a comprehensive
explanation on the how and why of that can be found in this thread.

<p><b>GLEP 42 (news) round six</b></p>
<p>
The discussion about portage news reporting which has been going on for
a few weeks now gets iterated once more in the hope of reaching a
workable solution.

<p><b>Viability of other SCM/version control systems for big
repo's</b></p>
<p>
While CVS is mature and quite stable it doesn't offer all the features
of newer version control systems. Some people have experimented with
migrating the gentoo-x86 repository (which won't happen in the near
future due to logistical and administrative issues).
<mail link="spyderous@gentoo.org">Donnie Berkholz</mail> asks for
experiences with alternatives, especially with performance and
scalability in mind.

edition of the GWN</uri>.  This new document talks about the initial design layout of 
the mysql database required to store package information. It goes into great detail 
as to data types, and displays more progress towards the project goals.

<title>Italy: Yet another Gentoo derivative</title>
<body>
<p>
Proclaiming to allow you to install Gentoo Linux on your computer in a 
matter of minutes, the RR4 and RR64 Linux DVDs you can get from <uri
link="http://www.lxnaydesign.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=27">Fabio
Erculiani</uri> differ from Gentoo in few ways, most importantly a default 
kernel with Reiser4 enabled that is certain to send shivers down the 
spines of many Gentoo developers who certainly wouldn't want to see 
your bug reports about this anywhere near the official Gentoo bugzilla. 
The RR4/64 project is still a remarkable effort, since it's a live system 
complete with both KDE and Gnome that boots directly from the DVD. The third 
beta 64-bit version of RR just came out on 26 December, sort of a late 
Christmas present from Fabio to his fellow Italians, with international 
users equally invited to give it a spin.

<title>Asteria (December 2005)</title>
<body>
<p>
Jon Hood, a developer working for <uri link="http://www.asteriasgi.com">Asteria 
Solutions Group, Inc.</uri> takes the current beta version of the <uri 
link="/proj/en/releng/installer/">Gentoo Installer</uri> for a test drive around 
the block, and appears <uri link="http://www2.asteriasgi.com/review/">quite 
satisfied</uri> with the result, calls it a "wonderful step in the right direction 
for the Gentoo distribution," and is particularly delighted because "people aren't 
supposed to actually USE testing software and have it WORK, but that's exactly what 
happened." His review includes a pretty little <uri
link="http://www2.asteriasgi.com/review/slideshow.html">slideshow</uri> documenting 
every step of the installation process when done via the GUI installer, very 
interesting for everybody who's never seen it at work.
