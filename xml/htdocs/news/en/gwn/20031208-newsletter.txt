 * 'emerge rsync' etiquette 
 * More Praise: Linux Journal 
     
We're very pleased to announce the launch of three major efforts: Gentoo 
Linux 2004, Portage-ng and catalyst. Starting with the next release of 
Gentoo Linux (Gentoo Linux 2004,) Gentoo Linux will move to a quarterly 
release schedule. More info is available in the Roadmap for Gentoo Linux 
2004[1].

In addition, we're pleased to announce the start of development on 
"portage-ng," the successor to the ever-popular portage package manager. 
Learn more at our Portage project page[2] and our in-progress architecture 
specification document for Portage-ng development[3]. Portage-ng will be a 
true community effort, and we encourage you to get involved.

And then there's catalyst. Starting with Gentoo Linux 2004, all releases 
(including LiveCDs) will be fully user-rebuildable using our new catalyst 
build technology. Using catalyst, Gentoo users will be able to easily 
create their own customized Gentoo releases, LiveCDs, GameCDs -- you name 
it. The current development version of catalyst[4] supports building 
stages and GRP sets on AMD64 (both 64-bit and 32-bit x86), x86 and 
PowerPC. LiveCD/GameCD building will be released by the end of the year. 
Keep up-to-date on catalyst by visiting our (currently sparse) catalyst 
project pages[5]. Enjoy!

Gentoo rsync.gentoo.org server compromised
------------------------------------------
  
On 2 December at approximately 03:45 UTC, one of the servers that makes up 
the rsync.gentoo.org rotation was compromised, possibly via a remotely 
exploitable rsync buffer overflow. Please also be sure to read 
GLSA-200312-02 and upgrade to kernels without the brk vulnerability.
 
The compromised system had both an IDS and a file integrity checker 
installed and we have a very detailed forensic trail of what happened once 
the box was breached, so we are reasonably confident that the portage tree 
stored on the box was unaffected. This box has been removed from all 
rsync.*.gentoo.org rotations and will remain so until forensic analysis 
has been completed and it has been wiped and rebuilt. For more details, 
see the GLSA.
 
In regards to the hard work involved in logging, tracking down and fixing 
this rsync vulnerability, Gentoo would like to extend thanks to Andrea 
Barisani, Nedd Ludd, Kurt Lieber, and Corey Shields (of the Gentoo 
Infrastructure team,) Michael Warfield and the ISS[6] team, and the rsync 
development team for handling the recent issues. A special thanks goes to 
Dave Monnier, Lead Security Engineer for the Information Technology 
Security Office of Indiana University, and his team, for their assistance 
as well.

'emerge rsync' etiquette
------------------------
  
Over recent weeks we have noticed an increase in the number of connection 
attempts people make to the rsync servers per day. Because rsync is quite 
intensive on the server (both for CPU and disk access), syncing many times 
a day wastes a lot of resources apart from bandwidth; during the time it's 
processing such a request it could be serving someone else with a greater 
number of changes in their portage tree.
 
As such, we request that people endeavour to run `emerge sync' at most 
once or twice a day; if you have several machines in a LAN, then set up a 
local rsync mirror updating from `rsync.gentoo.org' instead of targetting 
any particular mirror.
 
We reserve the right to monitor users' connection-rates in order to 
preserve server performance.
    
More praise: Linux Journal
--------------------------
  
This week Gentoo Linux has received praise from another Linux periodical: 
Linux Journal[7]. In their review[8] of Gentoo, they say that "In addition 
to endless customization possibilities and performance improvements, 
Gentoo offers solid documentation and a strong community support base".

Our featured developer this week is Arcady Genkin[9] (agenkin), who helps 
maintain many of the sound and video ebuilds in portage, notably 
alsa-drivers and xine. His primary duties are implementing bug fixes and 
ensuring that ebuild packages remain current. He has significant 
experience as an Open-Source developer, having been a core developer on 
the Squirrelmail[10] project and the primary author of the nhmon[11] tool 
for simultaneous monitoring of a large number of hosts.

Currently residing in downtown Toronto, Canada, Arcady is originally from 
St. Petersburg, Russia. He is a graduate of the Engineering School of 
Electronics in St. Petersburg, where he studied production of 
micro-electronic devices and technical translation. He also has a Honours 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. He 
works as a Systems Programmer/Administrator for the Department of Computer 
Science at the University of Toronto. The job primarily comprises 
programming various tools for automating systems administration and 
instructional assistance for Computer Science courses. According to 
Arcady, it is "the perfect mix of programming tasks, ranging from C, 
Python, Perl and PHP programming to keeping mail, DNS, web servers running 
to installing new software". 
 
Arcady's home environment contains six computers: a FreeBSD 
firewall/server, two workstations (his is the Gentoo one, we won't talk 
about his girlfriend's), a gentoo-based diskless multimedia station, and 
two notebooks (his runs Debian). At work, he has some responsibility for 
about 200 workstations, 50 Sun Sparc Ultra5 and Ultra10 X terminals, and a 
double-handful of servers. His workstation runs Gentoo. He is a KDE user 
(largely because of the reliable keyboard switching between Cyrillic and 
Latin). He launches XMMS[12] and Tkabber[13] at startup, and does much of 
his work in XEmacs[14].

Arcady enjoys hiking, skiing, watching movies, music and reading. He is 
currently learning French and reading Words by Sartre. He is fond enough 
of one of e.e. cummings poems to include it in his .sig: guilt is the 
cause of more disauders; than history's most obscene marorders. When asked 
about Gentoo, he told us that "Gentoo Linux can be a very convenient tool 
in experienced hands; its main advantage is that it is very customizable: 
it is extremely easy to add new packages to it, or modify existing ones, 
including the packages of the base system".

GLSA: rsync.gentoo.org rotation server compromised
--------------------------------------------------
  
On December 2nd at approximately 03:45 UTC, one of the servers that makes 
up the rsync.gentoo.org rotation was compromised via a remote exploit. At 
this point, we are still performing forensic analysis. However, the 
compromised system had both an IDS and a file integrity checker installed 
and we have a very detailed forensic trail of what happened once the box 
was breached, so we are reasonably confident that the portage tree stored 
on that box wasunaffected.
 
The attacker appears to have installed a rootkit and modified/deleted some 
files to cover their tracks, but left the server otherwise untouched. The 
box was in a compromised state for approximately one hour before it was 
discovered and shut down. During this time, approximately 20 users 
synchronized against the portage mirror stored on this box. The method 
used to gain access to the box remotely is still under investigation. We 
will release more details once we have ascertained the cause of the remote 
exploit. 
 
This box is not an official Gentoo infrastructure box and is instead 
donated by a sponsor. The box provides other services as well and the 
sponsor has requested that we not publicly identify the box at this time. 
Because the Gentoo part of this box appears to be unaffected by this 
exploit, we are currently honoring the sponsor's request. That said, if at 
any point, we determine that any file in the portage tree was modified in 
any way, we will release full details about the compromised server.

GLSA: kernel
------------
  
Lack of proper bounds checking exists in the do_brk() kernel function in 
Linux kernels prior to 2.4.23. This bug can be used to give a userland 
program or malicious service access to the full kernel address space and 
gain root privileges. This issue is known to be exploitable.
 
All kernel ebuilds in Portage have been bumped or patched and do not 
contain this vulnerability. The following is a list of recommended kernels.
 
 * aa-sources-2.4.23_pre6-r3

GLSA: exploitable overflow in rsync
-----------------------------------
  
Rsync version 2.5.6 contains a vulnerability that can be used to run 
arbitrary code. The Gentoo infrastructure team has some reasonably good 
forensic evidence that this exploit may have been used in combination with 
the Linux kernel brk vulnerability (see GLSA 200312-02) to exploit a 
rsync.gentoo.org rotation server (see GLSA-200312-01.) 
 
Please see http://lwn.net/Articles/61541/ for the security advisory 
released by the rsync development team.

Italy: Gentoo Day 29 November 2003
 
All too quietly, the Italian Linux Day in Venice[28] organised by the 
Venezia Free Software Users Group[29] passed us by on Saturday 29 
November, particularly embarrassing because the GECHI[30] (an acronym for 
"Gentoo CHannel Italy" also meaning "gecco" in Italian) hijacked the 
occasion to organise their first Gentoo Day! Gilberto de Faveri aka 
MyZelF[31] held a presentation[32] about Gentoo Linux, and the foto 
album[33] illustrates some other things that happened in the course of the 
event. Now, had they wanted an announcement of the event before the 
scheduled date, they'd surely would have told us[34], wouldn't they...

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Backup up files with tar
 
This weeks tip demonstrates a quick way to back up files using tar.
 
One of the options for tar is -T which allows you to specify which files 
should go in the tar archive. So, create a file named backup.confand list 
all files or directories you want backed up in this file (one per line). 
Then run tar and specify -T backup.conf.

This will archive your files in a file named backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.bz2 
(where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day).
 
Note: You could also specify an absolute path such as 
/backups/backup-`date +%Y-%m-%d.tar.bz` and run the command as a script 
from cron on a recurring basis.
