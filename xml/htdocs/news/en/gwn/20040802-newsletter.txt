Gentoo Linux 2004.2 released
----------------------------
  
Today marks the release of Gentoo Linux 2004.2 for the AMD64, HPPA, SPARC 
and X86 architectures! 
 
The Gentoo Linux Release Engineering project has worked hard to improve 
key problem areas identified in the 2004.1 release. These areas of 
improvement include, but are not limited to:
 
 * LiveCD compatibility with Dell server-class machines 
 * LiveCD compatibility with SMP machines 
 * x86 laptop PCMCIA support 
 * Wireless (802.11a/b/g) capabilities 
 * SATA support 
 
Detailed information for Gentoo Linux 2004.2, such as Release Notes and 
md5sums, can be found at the  2004.2 information page[1] 

 1. /proj/en/releng/release/2004.2/2004.2.xml
 
Gentoo Linux 2004.2 can be downloaded from any one of our official 
download mirrors[2], as well as from our new BitTorrent system[3]. Please 
note that pentium3, pentium4, and athlon-xp PackageCDs are only available 
either by download via BitTorrent or through purchase at the Gentoo 
Store[4]. Additional GRP sets will be available via BitTorrent shortly..

First Anniversary of BugDay
---------------------------
  
It's now been a full year since the first Gentoo BugDay was organized by 
former developer Brian Jackson and held[5] on August 2, 2003, and users 
and developers joined forces for the first time in #gentoo-bugs on 
irc.freenode.net to close as many bugs as possible. It's been a good year 
for this new monthly initiative: an average of over 200 bugs has been 
closed each month, and many developers have joined the project as a result 
of the user-developer interaction that occurs. Users and developers alike 
are invited to come to #gentoo-bugs on Saturday, August 7th, the 
anniversary BugDay, continue the tradition, and maybe even break the 
record for closed bugs - the current record of 233 bugs closed was set on 
1 May 2004. For more information, contact Bryan Ostergaard[6], the current 
organiser. Good luck!

German GWN translation team seeking additional translators
----------------------------------------------------------
  
After a somehow turbulent time, Marc Herren[7] is taking over as lead for 
the German translation of the GWN. To expand the team we're searching for 
additional people who would like to volunteer and help out with 
translations. If you feel able to translate documents from English into 
German and have at least half an hour to spare each week, drop Marc a line 
to let him know you're interested.

2. Projects Update
==================
   
Desktop
 
The Desktop team have officially deprecated[8] the xfree package in favor 
of xorg-x11 as the default implementation of X for Gentoo. This reflects 
problems with the XFree license on version 4.4 that seem to preclude its 
inclusion in Portage. Both packages will remain in portage as people 
migrate, but xfree is expected to be dropped sometime early next year. 
Both Gnome 2.6.2 and KDE 3.2.3 have recently been marked stable in the 
tree, while XFCE 4.0.6 is in testing prior to stable release. 

 8. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.desktop/1271
 
A number of the Desktop sub-projects[9] have created new web pages to help 
users keep abreast of their activities, including the Science[10], 
Video[11] and Games[12] teams.

Documentation
 
The Documentation Team is pleased to announce that Xavier Neys[13] has 
been named as Operational Lead for the Gentoo Documentation Project. In 
addition to updates to the Gentoo Handbook[14] to align with the 2004.2 
LiveCD release, the team has released several new documents, including a 
Home Router Guide[15] and Handbooks for ARM[16] and PPC64[17] 
architectures. There have also been updates to the Portage Guide, Kernel 
Guide and FAQ to reflect recent software changes, and the Desktop 
Configuration Guide has been replaced by new set of i>Gentoo Desktop 
Documentation Resources[18].

(SELinux[19]) and PIE-SSP[20] stages and LiveCDs for the 2004.2 release.

Transparent Squid Proxy Using IPTables
 
One list member had some issues getting Squid and IPTables to work happily 
together using the latest ebuilds. This thread[27] not only has a great 
example of an IPTables transparent proxy rule, but also some tips on 
getting the proper modules in place to use it!

"Weird" Executables in /bin
 
What's that left-bracket doing there in /bin? If you're curious, check out 
this thread[28].

Upgrading Gentoo
 
Is it necessary to "upgrade" Gentoo when a new LiveCD comes out? With the 
recent release of 2004.2, one user wasn't sure[29]. Although the answer 
was given rather quickly, the thread grew large, and spawned discussions 
on effectively using Portage profiles, and more.

Strange SSH Activity Making the Rounds
 
The gentoo-security list has had several users report odd SSH activity 
over the past few days. Symptoms include repeated failed logins by 
normally unused accounts, as well as a report by a user of the Debian list 
of an actual break-in. Check out more details here[30].
