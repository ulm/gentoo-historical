<title>Officially unofficial developer documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
<mail link="ciaranm@gentoo.org">Ciaran McCreesh</mail> has published a collection
of <uri link="http://www.firedrop.org.uk/devmanual/">developer-oriented 
documentation</uri>. With the intent of creating an "unofficial alternative to the 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml">devrel 
handbook</uri>," the document is actually quite canonical in purpose, content 
and presentation. The "Unofficial Gentoo Development Guide" contains ebuild and 
eclass writing instructions, help with Portage's structure and files typically
dealt with when developing for Gentoo Linux, and many more practical tips and tricks
for the aspiring Gentooist. Contributors include Gentoo developers <mail 
link="g2boojum@gentoo.org">Grant Goodyear</mail>, <mail link="rac@gentoo.org">Robert 
Coie</mail>, <mail link="ka0ttic@gentoo.org">Aaron Walker</mail> and <mail 
link="slarti@gentoo.org">Tom Martin</mail>, others are encouraged to add their 
input. "The target audience is existing developers and potential recruits -- an 
existing knowledge of Gentoo from the user perspective is assumed," says Ciaran in 
<uri link="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/27562">the announcement</uri> 
posted to Gentoo's developer mailing list last Sunday.

<title>Speed bumps on the way to OpenLDAP 2.2</title>
<body>
<p>
<mail link="robbat2@gentoo.org">Robin Johnson</mail> has just put the 
latest version of <uri link="http://www.openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</uri>, v2.2.26, 
into the Portage tree: "I don't see anything that is now holding 
back the 2.2 series from <path>~arch</path>. In two weeks, I plan to move it to 
<path>~arch</path>, from its present <path>package.mask</path> status. It shouldn't 
cause any problems for people who have OpenLDAP installed as a client only, but 
it'll be a bit bumpy for those running OpenLDAP servers. The ebuild will exit if 
it detects the server data files from previous versions of OpenLDAP, and display 
instructions on how to upgrade safely." Robbat2 warns against bypassing them "at 
your own peril, as you will end up with a badly corrupted database. Also note that 
the <path>slapd.conf</path> syntax has had some minor but annoying changes that will 
block <c>slapd</c> from starting until they are updated."

<p><b>ebuild cruft?</b></p>
<p>
A rather unconventional proposal to potentially speed up portage (by
removing all unneeded ebuilds) started this thread about the slowness of
Portage, alternative architectures and all the other little annoying things
that can happen with Portage.
</p>
<ul>
<li><uri
link="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/27470">Ebuild cruft? </uri></li>
</ul>


<p><b>Headhunter spam</b></p>
<p>
As Gentoo becomes more and more popular, it also becomes the target of
headhunters that scout for inexpensive labour. One of the more prominent
examples started a nice thread about why you should know your audience,
why you shouldn't spam development mailinglists and why Debian is not
Gentoo ...
</p>
<ul>
<li><uri

spam </uri></li>
</ul>


<p><b>Supporting Commercial Software in Gentoo</b></p>
<p>
Since (obviously) Gentoo is the best thing that happened since
sliced bread, more and more "commercial" vendors show interest. As they
prefer a stable environment while Gentoo is generally a moving target,
<mail link="mattm@gentoo.org">Matthew Marlowe</mail> asks if a dedicated
profile (in this case for MySQL certification) could be made available.

<title>Germany: KDE-look.org migration to Gentoo Linux host</title>
<body>
<p>
It's a smallish individual project, but it has quite an impact on many desktop 
environment users of the KDE, XFCE and Gnome flavors whenever they're looking
for some artwork to embellish their work environment: Page impressions on 
<path>kde-look.org</path>, <path>kde-apps.org</path>, <path>gnome-look.org</path> 
and <path>xfce-look.org</path> have grown to 25 million a month, representing 2
terabyte of traffic. <uri link="http://www.kde-look.org">The site</uri> is one 
of the most important sources for wallpapers or desktop themes available.
</p>
<p>
No wonder its master Frank Karlitschek's expectations towards performance and
security have been growing at a similar pace. His main server had been running
Redhat 8 for the past two year, but support was running out, and since no security 
updates are available for this version any longer, it became impossible to keep the 
system safe from attacks. Frank decided to move on: The new kde-look.org has 
migrated from a Celeron 1.2GHz with 512MB RAM to a Pentium 4 sporting a 3.2GHz CPU 
and twice as much memory: "The load average fell from 30 to 1.1," says Frank 
Karlitschek. "And I don't know whether that's just the hardware, or because I 
decided to run the site on a Gentoo Linux host now."
</p>
<p>
His decision to build a Gentoo environment for the popular site was driven by
the ease and thrift of its installation: "I can manage with very few packages,
an optimized, lean installation is much easier with Gentoo than other 
distributions," says Karlitschek, whose webserver is now spinning on a base 
system of just a few megabytes. "The other reason is the way Gentoo is making 
it easy to keep it current. Updates even of the kernel, the glibc or a new gcc 
are so easy, and just as easy is maintaining a Gentoo system up-to-date and 
secure."

<title>Austria: Grazer Linuxtage</title>

Forum administrator <mail link="amne@gentoo.org">Wernfried Haas</mail> 
successfully avoided showing his face to Austrian paparazzi at the 
Grazer LinuxTage <uri

year</uri> (sitting behind someone right under the window on the right) -- this 
year he will be unable to hide from the cameras: Accompanied by 
several Gentoo-users, Amne and friends will be representing Gentoo Linux at 
Austria's most prominent Linux and open-source event, from 13 to 14 May. They will 
be answering questions, serving those in need of LiveCDs (bringing along all 
permutations of LiveCD images and a sufficient amount of blank media). Aside 
from the exhibition floor, there will be many lectures and workshops at the 
Grazer LinuxTage, more information can be found on <uri

<title>USA: Pluckerized Gentoo handbook</title>
<body>
<p>
Despite being mostly a Debian and FreeBSD user himself, David A. Desrosiers from 
New London, Connecticut has thoughtfully converted the official Gentoo handbook 
to <uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?plucker-1.8-r1">Plucker</uri> 
format, useful for people who'd like to browse the installation manual on their 
Palm OS devices. Using appropriately plucker-conformant ebook readers, the Gentoo 
handbook can also be viewed on other handheld platforms, including WinCE- and 
Linux-based PDAs. David's <uri link="http://code.plkr.org/gentoo/">converted 
Gentoo handbook</uri> is available for eight architectures and 12 languages from
his website, and the Plucker maintainer even has plans to offer Gentoo's 
RSS feed (of posts to the official Gentoo website) via his new "Plucker 
Syndication Server" as an online service soon.

<title>Newsforge (28 April 2005)</title>
<body>
<p>
<uri link="https://e.ututo.org.ar/indexee.html">Ututo-e</uri>, the Argentinian Gentoo 
spin-off by Diego Saravia and David Oliveira, was <uri link="http://os.newsforge.com/os/05/04/21/195224.shtml?tid=2&amp;tid=150">thoroughly 
reviewed</uri> by Newsforge author Bruce Byfield last week. "The only free distribution" 
(as in: 100 percent conformant to the ideals of the Free Software Foundation) gets good 
marks for acting "as a reminder of how far the free software community has come -- and 
of how small a price users need to pay today to support its principles." As a Linux 
distribution totally void of non-FSF-approved software, ututo-e is lacking a Java 
runtime environment and other "non-free" software, which the author seems to find not 
unpleasant. On the other hand, his article has triggered a storm of protest from 
Debianists who use the talkback function at the Newsforge site to debate Richard 
Stallman's endorsement of Ututo-e.

<title>KDE.news (28 April 2005)</title>
<body>
<p>
KDE developer Jakub Stachowski gave an <uri link="http://dot.kde.org/1114696139/">interview 
about Zeroconf's service discovery</uri> at the KDE.news website last Thursday. After an
introduction about what Zeroconf actually does ("Relevant applications can advertise their 
services, such as shared folders or networked games, which can then be browsed with the 
<path>zeroconf:/</path> ioslave."), Jakub explains the status of Zeroconf support in KDE,
the relationship to Apple's Rendezvous, and -- being asked which Linux distributions carry 
Zeroconf at the moment, simply answers: "First was as usual Gentoo - you need to add 
'zeroconf' to USE flags in order to enable it.

<title>Slashdot (27 April 2005)</title>
<body>
<p>
A <uri link="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/27/1836227">Slashdot 
article</uri> about Gentoo's <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/installer/">GUI installer project</uri> has 
received the usual mix of benevolent attention and fuming hatred from readers last 
Wednesday. Author Jon Latane finds the current installation process "notorious for 
scaring off potential users before they even get to try it," but some of his readers 
seem more concerned about losing their "bragging rights for being able to install 
Gentoo using only a bash shell..." Innocent Slashdot fun time again.
