      <title>Release testers wanted</title>
      <body>
      <p>
        The Gentoo <uri link="/proj/en/releng">Release Engineering</uri>
        project is looking for experienced users and developers to assist
        with the testing of the upcoming 2006.1 release. They are looking to
        have a wide array of hardware to test. All applicants will need to
        be available for testing, as well as have access to broadband Internet
        access, and a CD/DVD burner, since there will be a large volume of
        ISO images to test and new images will be released quite often.
        Interested parties should contact <uri
        link="mailto:roger55@gentoo.org">Roger Miliker</uri> with the
        following information:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>CPU type (i686, PPC, AMD64, etc.)</li>
        <li>Amount of system memory</li>
        <li>Type of disks (IDE, SCSI, SATA, etc.)</li>
        <li>Type of optical reader (IDE, SCSI, SATA, etc.)</li>
        <li>Type of video card (for AMD64/x86 only)</li>
        <li>Type of optical recorder (CD, DVD, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They will select users whose hardware will give them the greatest
        coverage of testing capabilities, as well as users with a strong
        background in providing good information to developers for resolving
        issues.

      <title>Gentoo x86 arch testers and developers wanted</title>
      <body>
      <p>
        The x86 architecture team is looking for more ambitious members of the
        community who would like to help out by joining the team as Arch
        Testers. If you would like to give back to Gentoo, but don't know how,
        then this may be a good way for you to start. You would be helping by
        testing applications to be marked stable and assisting in general
        x86-specific bugs. Please take a look at the <uri
        link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/x86/arch-testers-faq.xml">x86 
        AT documentation</uri>, and if you have questions about anything, please
        either email <mail link="hparker@gentoo.org">Homer Parker</mail> or
        <mail link="tsunam@gentoo.org">Joshua Jackson</mail>. They are also
        looking for more developers to join the team and help out in resolving
        bug reports, keywording requests, and security bugs. Interested
        developers need only have a stable system or chroot, and be willing to
        work on bugs assigned to the x86 team. Please send an email to the
        <mail link="x86@gentoo.org">x86 team</mail> alias, if you are interested
        in helping out.

      <title>Important ALSA information</title>
      <body>
      <p>
        Diego "Flameeyes" Pettenò has updated the ALSA packages to 1.0.12rc1
        for compatibility with kernel 2.6.17's release.  There have been some
        changes to the packages.  The <c>media-plugins/alsa-jack</c> package
        has been deprecated and its functionality has been added to the
        <c>media-plugins/alsa-plugins</c> package.  PowerPC users will be
        interested to know that snd-aoa has been merged into
        <c>media-sound/alsa-driver</c> for 1.0.12rc1, which is currently in
        package.mask, is in need of testing by users with the appropriate
		hardware before it can be unmasked.

      <title>New Java system</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The Java team pleased to announce that the new Java system has finally
          hit the tree. It's currently in package.mask, but the Java team
		  expects to unmask it in the next few days.
		</p>

        <p>
          To begin using it, you will need to add the appropriate entries to
          <c>/etc/portage/package.unmask</c>, and then follow the <uri
          link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/java/java-upgrade.xml">upgrade

        <p>
          For those not familar with that this means, here are some highlights:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Ability to switch the current VM on the fly</li>
          <li>Changes to the user and system VM take effect immediately, and no
          longer are tied to the shell environment, which means you no longer
          have to run env-update followed by source /etc/profile when you
          switch the system VM</li>
          <li>Now has the concept of a "build VM", which is used to emerge
          packages, and is configured independently of the system VM</li>
          <li>For each version of Java, ie 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, etc, the build VM can
          be configured as to which vendor and version of a VM to use</li>
          <li>The VM at emerge time will be switched on the fly according to its
          configuration, as well as the dependency of the package. For example,
          some packages won't compile with 1.5. In these cases, a 1.4 VM will be
          used at build time</li>
          <li>Java packages which build with ant will have their build.xml
          rewritten at build time in order to ensure that the correct version of
          Java bytecode is compiled</li>
          <li>Will be able to unmask Java 1.5 soon and be able to handle Java
          1.6 when it comes out this fall</li>

      <p><b>Larry the Cow - Lame?</b></p>

      <p>
        Some forum users have expressed a dislike of Larry.  They feel that he
        has no purpose, is not relevant to Gentoo and is 'lame'.  Others,
        however, seem to love the quirkiness of our Cow.  Is Larry a useful 
        mascot, a valuable part of Gentoo's history, or just an archaic 
        character with no purpose?

      <p><b>grep vs bash regex</b></p>

      <p>
        Roy Marples did some tests replacing <c>grep</c> with internal bash
        functions the results were impressive, with the internal bash functions
        being faster. His testing happened only on small files and assumes that
        grep may perform better on larger files as grep returns once a match is
        found whereas bash has to read the entire file.

      <title>Play some games: ScummVM</title>
      <body>

      <p>
        While most of today's games won't run on Linux systems easily, there is
        still a wealth of options in yesterday's catalog that work great with
        an emulator. If you can hunt down an original copy of the games, <uri
        link="http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/">ScummVM</uri> will run some
        classic point-and-click adventure games such as "Full Throttle", "Day
        of the Tentacle" and "The Secret of Monkey Island."
      </p>

      <p>
        The project first started out as a way to run old games that used
        LucasArt's SCUMM game engine, but now supports other games as well. See
        the <uri link="http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/compatibility.php">
        compatibility list</uri> for all the games it can run.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're not up to the task of hunting down computer games from the
        1980s though, you're still in luck. One such game has been released for
        free distribution -- Flight of the Amazon Queen, and it's available in
        portage.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get up and running, first emerge scummvm on your system, which is
        already been marked stable on four architectures -- amd64, ppc, sparc,
        and x86. ScummVM itself runs on many other platforms: Microsoft
        Windows, Mac OS X, PocketPC, PalmOS, OS/2 and more.  Depending on your
        architecture, Flight of the Amazon Queen might be marked testing, so
        adjust your package.keywords file as necessary.
      </p>

<pre caption="Installing queen">
# <i>emerge scummvm -va</i>
# <i>echo "games-rpg/queen" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords"</i>
# <i>emerge queen</i>
</pre>

      <p>
        After that, add your user to the 'games' group if you haven't already.
      </p>

<pre caption="Adding user to games group">
# <i>groups larry</i>
# <i>gpasswd -a larry games</i>
</pre>
        
      <p>
        If you are adding your user to the group, remember that you must log out
        and back in before the changes will take effect. Fire up scummvm, and it
        will open a graphical window where you can add your games. By default,
        FOTAQ won't be displayed in the list, but you can add it by clicking
        'Add Game'. The directory with game data is
        <c>/usr/share/games/queen</c>. Once you navigate to that directory,
        simply click the 'Choose' button.  After that, you should be good to go!
		You can also simply run 'queen' to start the game directly.
