                <p> Only few hours ahead of the <uri

                        of many components</uri> of the complete Solaris source
                    code being publicly released under Sun's brand new,
                    OSI-approved CDDL open-source license, Gentoo is pleased to
                    announce plans to add <uri
                    link="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</uri> support
                    to Portage. Gentoo Senior Manager and OpenSolaris pilot
                    program participant, Pieter Van den Abeele, has been working
                    closely with Sun's management, legal and engineering teams
                    to prepare this move. Gentoo will be leveraging the hard
                    work of long-time Solaris users and Gentoo
                    Developers-in-training Sunil Kumar and Jason Wohlgemuth,
                    whose "Portaris" project has been running on top of Solaris
                    9 and 10 builds for <uri

                <p> With "Sun going back to its roots by open-sourcing the
                    code," Pieter expects OpenSolaris to have a huge impact on
                    the open-source market. "With their service and support
                    network and their expertise, they can redefine at least part
                    of the open-source landscape in the enterprise," says
                    Pieter. And he expects Gentoo to become an important factor
                    for OpenSolaris' success: "We're able to build on prior
                    experience with Gentoo ports to non-Linux operating systems,
                    we've had the technology preview of <uri

                    on Opendarwin support, and we're well out of the starting
                    blocks for the race to Gentoo-ified <uri

                        kernels and userland applications</uri>," he says. "But
                    even I wasn't quite prepared for my Sparc booting with a
                    Gentoo bootsplash," laughs Pieter.</p>

                    Gentoo's package management system on top of Solaris 9 and
                    10 systems. Its two biggest contributors, Sunil Kumar and
                    Jason Wohlgemuth (who, like Pieter, is a member of Sun's
                    pilot program for open-sourcing Solaris), have invested a
                    tremendous amount of their time in this project, culminating
                    in a veritable <uri

            <title>New kernel profiles for 2005.0</title>
            <body>
                <p> In view of the 2005.0 release date, the Gentoo developers on
                    the kernel team have been working very hard amalgamating the
                    sources in the Portage tree. Since the 2.6 kernel tree will
                    become the default for all supported architectures except
                    Sparc, the separate kernel categories in Portage are being
                    abolished and replaced by the same generic names formerly
                    used for the 2.4 versions of the same sources. This is the
                    first time that the new "cascading profiles" feature in
                    Portage has been used to manage the dependancy requirements
                    of a package. In essence, this means that the same package -
                    say, <path>gentoo-sources</path> - will automatically decide
                    whether its 2.6 or 2.4 version is being requested, based on
                    the specifications in the chosen sub-profile. By linking
                    <path>/etc/make.profile</path> to either the 2.4 or 2.6
                    subprofile (whichever may exist for your profile)
                    in <path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-[OS]/[arch]/2005.0/</path>,
                    you can choose which one you want as your personal default,
                    while the other version will be masked.<b> If you don't
                        choose a subprofile, 2.6 will automatically become the
                        default, where applicable.</b>
                </p>
                <p> "If you're currently still running 2.4 kernels, but don't
                    care all that much about staying, this would be a perfect
                    moment to switch," suggests Gentoo kernel dev <mail
                        link="johnm@gentoo.org">John Mylchreest</mail>. "We do
                    recommend switching to 2.6 wherever possible, and you can
                    catch up on what's involved by reading our <uri
                        link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/migration-to-2.6.xml">kernel
                        migration guide</uri>." Sparc being the only
                    architecture with a number of unresolved issues preventing a
                    move to 2.6 as default, the newer version will become the
                    standard for virtually everybody else. Users with any of the
                    following kernel sources currently installed on their
                    systems need to be aware that these are going to be removed
                    at the same time as the 2005.0 release. Their replacements
                    are also listed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <path>development-sources</path> will become <path>vanilla-sources</path>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <path>gentoo-dev-sources</path> will become <path>gentoo-sources</path>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <path>rsbac-dev-sources</path> will become <path>rsbac-sources</path>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <path>hardened-dev-sources</path> will become <path>hardened-sources</path>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> The switch is going to be automatic for users who follow a
                    steady <c>rsync</c> and <c>emerge world</c> diet. When the
                    next version of their kernel sources becomes available, an
                        <c>emerge --update</c> will pull in the source tarball
                    under its new name, and update accordingly. While the Gentoo
                    kernel team recommends switching, this also works for users
                    with specific reasons to keep their 2.4 series: They just
                    have to make sure they link to a 2.4 subprofile, and
                        <c>emerge --update</c> for them will consequently only
                    fetch and install newer versions in the 2.4 tree, not 2.6.</p>
                <p> The move on to the new profile that sets 2.6 by default will
                    involve changing from the old <path>linux26-headers</path>
                    to <path>linux-headers</path> at the same time. An <c>emerge
                    glibc</c> - or <c>emerge system</c> - may be a good idea at
                    that point.</p>
                <p> Except for the <path>pegasos-dev-sources</path> that have
                    already been moved to<path>pegasos-sources</path>, the
                    changeover will occur at the same time as the 2005.0
                    release. More detailed information, including specific
                    instructions for linking <path>/etc/make.profile</path> to
                    the right subprofile will be made available at that time.</p>

            <title>Genesi Open Desktop Workstation sales - Gentoo Linux pre-installed</title>
            <body>
                <p> From 1 March 2005, Luxembourg-based <uri
                    link="http://www.genesi.lu">Genesi</uri> will start selling
                    their Open Desktop Workstation in a configuration with
                    Gentoo Linux pre-installed - for a price of $999 USD, ten
                    percent of which will be donated to the Gentoo Foundation!
                    Bill Buck, CEO of Genesi, explains the new sponsoring deal:
                    "For every workstation we sell thanks to a referral from
                    Gentoo's website, we'll donate 100 USD to the Foundation."
                    As many Gentoo users have been looking for attractive
                    opportunities to support Gentoo financially, sales are
                    expected to soar now that the ODWs are clearly benefitting
                    the project as a whole. Moreover, Genesi is offering their
                    Gentoo-ified models at a considerable rebate compared to
                    their own standard offers of desktop and server
                    configurations for $1399 and $1799 USD.</p>
                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050124_odw.jpg" short="ODW" caption="Open Desktop Workstations with Gentoo Linux/PPC, shipping soon!"/>
                <p> The Open Desktop Workstation is configured as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pegasos II with 1GHz G4 processor</li>
                    <li>256MB of PC2100 DDR RAM</li>
                    <li>CDRW drive</li>
                    <li>40GB ATA100 Hard Disk</li>
                    <li>Radeon 9200SE 128MB AGP Graphics with DVI, VGA, and TV-Out</li>
                    <li>Low profile small footprint case - tower or desktop orientation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thirteen of these ODWs had previously been donated to Gentoo
                    developers for thorough testing and feature development, and
                    consequently Gentoo fully supports the PegasosPPC. The
                    pre-installed version is based on the 2004.3 release of
                    Gentoo Linux/PPC.</p>
                <p> Pre-ordering is available right away. Sales will begin on 1
                    March 2005 - detailed information about how to order will be
                    sent to everyone expressing interest. To be alerted when
                    orders for the ODWs with Gentoo Linux can be placed, send a
                    message to <mail link="odw@gentoo.org">odw@gentoo.org</mail>.</p>

            <p> Gentoo/PPC developer <mail link="dostrow@gentoo.org">Daniel
                Ostrow</mail> has succeeded in bringing the Mac Mini into the
                family of Gentoo supported PowerPC based machines. The system
                will be fully supported by 2005.0 and boots cleanly using
                2004.3.</p>

            <title>Renovating the Forums - phpBB brush-up and other changes</title>
            <body>
                <p>Something's afoot in the Forums, and we asked one of the
                        admins, <mail link="ian@gentoo.org">Christian
                    Hartmann</mail> (ian), what was going on. The following
                    interview sheds some light on what we can expect to happen
                    in the very near future:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q:</b> The Forums footer says: <e>Powered by phpBB 2.0.x
                        © 2001, 2002 phpBB Group</e>. What version are we
                    actually using at the moment?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> At the moment we are using a heavily patched
                    version of the phpBB 2.0 branch. All security related bugs
                    have been patched. Furthermore we applied some <uri
                        link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20040920-newsletter.xml#doc_chap1">performance
                        tweaks and other modifications</uri>.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q:</b> Why aren't you just using a vanilla phpBB 2.0.11 instead?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> That's a very frequently asked question. First of
                    all we will indeed switch to the latest stable phpBB release
                    soon. Backporting all the patches we applied to their 2.0.x
                    codebase will almost be done by the time you read this.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q:</b> What about all the feature requests in <uri
                        link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum.php?f=5">Gentoo
                        Forums Feedback</uri>?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> We look at every post in Gentoo Forums Feedback
                    and know exactly what our users demand. After installing the
                    new forums software we will have a look at implementing a
                    lot of new and exciting stuff. Expect a period where we'll
                    have something new almost every week...</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q:</b> Does that mean that you will also make use of mods?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> Exactly! That is one of the reasons why we are
                    switching to the latest phpBB release. This will make adding
                    modifications much easier.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q:</b> Adding modifications to the forums were a "no-no"
                    for a long time. Whatmade you change your mind?</p>

                    <b>A:</b> Gentoo is project based entirely on the work of
                    volunteers, and so is its Infrastructure team. We just
                    didn't have the resources to do any of the more
                    sophisticated things. Now that we do, it was about time we
                    changed our policy and started working on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q:</b> Talking about modifications and additions, what
                    can we expect to see?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>A:</b> We'll have to move the forums web service to a
                    different server soon, and we'll start making use of the new
                    forums software when switching to that new server. The user
                    hopefully will not even realize that we switched to
                    different software. It will be mostly the same as it is now,
                    just with a clean codebase, and with some of the earlier
                    itches like the <uri

                    bug</uri> ironed out. More corrections will be made to the
                    language packs, and after that we will add two more forums,
                    one each for our Turkish and our Arab users. There's a lot
                    more on our todo-list, but we can talk about those additions
                    once we're done with the first batch.</p>

            <title>Watching logfiles on your desktop: root-tail</title>
            <body>
                <p>A good sysadmin should be able to take care of what's going
                    on his system at any time. To keep up with what's going on
                    it would be best to see the logfiles just scrolling by on
                    the desktop, but most utilities, like <c>tail -f</c>, cannot
                    handle more than one file at a time. Moreover, it's a little
                    tricky to configure a terminal so that it becomes borderless
                    and transparent.</p>
                <p>Enter <uri
                    link="http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=root-tail">x11-terms/root-tail</uri>.
                    This handy utility opens a window on your desktop and lets
                    you look at any given logfile's entries as they're made.
                    There is only one problem: Most modern Window Managers
                    occupy the desktop and show a background-image on it. But
                    there are workarounds, and one (for xfce4) is shown here:</p>
<pre caption="Script for starting root-tail in xfce4">
#!/bin/bash
deskid=`xwininfo -int -name 'Desktop' | grep 'Desktop' | awk -F' ' '{ print $4 }';`
root-tail -g 900x150+50+575 -font 6x10 -outline -minspace -id ${deskid} -f \
   /var/log/emerge.log,yellow \
   /var/log/messages,lightblue
</pre>
                <p>This script will find out the PID of xfce4's desktop-process,
                    then fork <c>root-tail</c> into the background with a given
                    size, place and font upon the desktop where the ID is now
                    known, and will show two logfiles, printing messages in
                    different colours. Bear in mind that if you are using a
                    localized environemnt, <c>Desktop</c> could be named
                    differently, of course.</p>
