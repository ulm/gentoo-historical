<title>Linux World Expo San Francisco report</title>
<body>
<p>
The 2005 San Francisco LWE (Linux World Expo) turned out to be a big success,
and Gentoo was there to take a place in it all.  In the scope of things, all
went pretty well for the small Gentoo booth.  There were a couple of problems
with network connections and booth location (There were 2 stories of expo space
this time, and Gentoo was on the top).
</p>

<note>
<mail link="wolf31o2@gentoo.org">Chris Gianelloni</mail> and <mail
link="weeve@gentoo.org">Jason Wever</mail> talk with users at the booth.  On
display are an x86 box as well as a Pegasos PPC <uri
link="http://vendors.gentoo.org/index.cgi?page=1&amp;comGroup=1">Open Desktop
Workstation</uri>.
</note>
<p>
A large number of Gentoo infrastructure staff was present, including a few
regular developers, and others that were here just to see the expo.  The people
at the booth at one time or the other included <mail link="cshields@gentoo.org">Corey
Shields</mail>, <mail link="klieber@gentoo.org">Kurt Lieber</mail>, <mail
link="ramereth@gentoo.org">Lance Albertson</mail>, <mail link="lcars@gentoo.org">Andrea
Barisani</mail>, <mail link="wolf31o2@gentoo.org">Chris Gianelloni</mail>, <mail
link="weeve@gentoo.org">Jason Wever</mail>, <mail link="wormo@gentoo.org">Stephanie
J. Lockwood-Childs</mail>, <mail link="compnerd@gentoo.org">Saleem Abdulrasool</mail>, and
<mail link="chriswhite@gentoo.org">Chris White</mail>.  Indiana University
and Oregon State University Open Source Labs helped with a lot of the setup for
Gentoo, and thanks go out to them.
</p>
<p>Many questions and comments arose at the Gentoo booth. Most visitors just
wanted to know what Gentoo was, others had used it before, and wanted to stop
by and say hi.  A lot of business-related users came up to, and asked questions
about distributed installations and how Gentoo was adapted to enterprise use.
A couple of other projects had some good things coming too: <uri
link="http://www.trolltech.no">Trolltech</uri> is working hard on QA, and was
asking Linux distributions (including Gentoo), about the quality of Qt in their
distributions. <uri link="http://www.x.org">X.Org</uri> modularization was
another hot topic, as well as the move over to <c>autotools</c> as means for an
easier development state.  The Linux Test Project was there, making honorable
mention of <mail link="vapier@gentoo.org">Mike Frysinger's</mail> work in patch
development and helping out the project, Philippe Ombredanne, author of
EasyEclipse, stopped by for a chat with Chris White and Saleem Abdulrasool about
splitting up the <c>eclipse</c> ebuilds. Last but not least, the <uri
link="http://www.genux.org">GenUX project</uri> made an appearance, too, to
talk about their own project.
</p>
<p>
The lower floor of the Expo was mostly businesses and paying exhibitors with new
projects to share, Intel showing some of their 64-bit technology, HP doing some
talks on open source as a way for businesses to operate, with Sun being mainly a
display of projects such as Looking Glass, some Sparc based systems, as well as
talks on OpenSolaris. All in all the Expo was a huge success, and we hope next
year's will be too.

<title>Gentoo-driven -- car console</title>
<body>
<p>
There's hardly anyone left these days who would be exposed to just one solitary
computer in their everyday environment. Most people have computers in their
homes on top the ones they use at the workplace, and perhaps a laptop thrown in
for good measure and the dull moments during lengthy commutes. But how many
people have one installed in the console of their cars? And how many of those
have it run Gentoo Linux? Here's one example that rippled the slashdot surface
for a few days, a <uri link="http://www.timekiller.org/carpc/">CarPC mounted in
a Mazda sports vehicle</uri>. Based on a Via Epia small form factor mainboard,
including cool features like a GPS receiver, Bluetooth and a high speed
wireless network make this Gentoo-powered car a geek's dream vehicle.
And to make it even more amazing a mobile phone connection (Verizon
EVDO) is used for streaming video from a MythTV box at home so that the proud
owner of the car can watch any movie while on the road ...

<title>MythTV project</title>
<body>
<p>
Last week, a Gentoo user by the name of Jay Ferrandini "set out to build a
super-optimized, high performance MythTV box completely from scratch for a
maximum of 500 USD" and managed to get as far as assembling all the parts by
last weekend. <uri link="http://www.ubershirt.com/mythbox.html">His story</uri>
is still in mid-development, but interesting nonetheless. He even gives a short
overview of the whole install process, from hardware setup to tweaking
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>. He even included a part from the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/index.xml">
"amazing" Gentoo Handbook</uri>, showing again that
installing Gentoo is not as hard as some people claim and that if you
are willing to invest some time, Gentoo can do (almost) anything.

<p><b>Reading up on the Linux kernel</b></p>

Looking for some linux reading or just want to understand how a kernel really
works? Well, this thread should be useful:

<p><b>Generating ChangeLog files automatically from `cvs commit`</b></p>
<p>
<mail link="vapier@gentoo.org">Mike Frysinger</mail> started a discussion
with the idea of generating Changelogs automatically from the cvs commit
messages. This would facilitate the management of changelogs and also
force a common format on all of them.
</p>
<ul>

ChangeLog files automatically from `cvs commit`</uri></li>
</ul>


<p><b>"Maintainer wanted"</b></p>
<p>
Some time ago the "maintainer-wanted" alias was created to help track all
user-submitted ebuilds in Bugzilla. <mail link="ciaranm@gentoo.org">Ciaran
McCreesh</mail> asks for a new bugzilla keyword that shows that an ebuild
has been checked for correctness by a developer. This would help potential
maintainers to see if an ebuild satisfies basic QA requirements or if it
might need lots of work to get it fixed, thus making it easier or harder for
new packages to be "adopted" by a developer.

<p><b>ebuild design issue: splitting ebuilds?</b></p>
<p>
A discussion on whether ebuilds should be monolithic or separated into server
vs client or headers vs full package splits evolved on the developer mailing
list. It wasn't the first of its kind, and indeed died down after exploring
the usual problems and shortcomings of such a proposal, but had its moments:

<p>
An <uri link="http://openenterprisetrends.com/news.php?action=view_record&amp;idnum=455">article
titled "Oracle Eyes Open Source Add-ons for Linux"</uri> by Vance McCarthy reports that Oracle
is hoping for Gentoo to join the list of distributions to include Oracle's Cluster File System 2
that was placed under an open source license earlier this month. Quoting Wim Coekaerts, Oracle's
director of Linux engineering, the aim is to get OCFS2 in the official 2.6 kernel tree, too.

There's life beyond Google: in its September issue the iX, German's leading IT
publisher Heise's "magazine for professional information technology", sheds
some light on <uri link="http://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/2005/09/100">two
open-source search engines</uri>. Both the stable - yet somewhat stagnated -
ASPseek project, and a more recent Java alternative called Nutch receive good
marks in the test, for which author Michael Nebel installed the latter on a
Gentoo system, based on a Pentium III CPU with 800MHz, 360MB of RAM and a 120GB
harddisk, watching Nutch's index grow over three months before writing his
report.

<title>Logging the boot messages</title>
<body>
<p>
Wish to log the console output during the boot process? Starting with the new
<path>baselayout-1.12</path> it's now possible: Just edit <path>/etc/conf.d/rc</path>
to show</p>
<pre caption="Extract from /etc/conf.d/rc">
RC_BOOTLOG="yes" <comment>(instead of RC_BOOTLOG="no")</comment>
</pre>
<p>and emerge <uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?showconsole-1.07">Showconsole</uri>.
After that all the messages scrolling past the screen as you boot will be
stored in <path>/var/log/boot.msg</path>
