<title>Website redesign finalists up for voting</title>
<body>
<p>The Gentoo Foundation's website redesign contest has reached its final stage. More than 30 designs had been submitted to the preselection committee, and choosing only five candidates was not easy for the jury. Now the finalists are up for public assessment at the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/redesign-guidelines.xml">contest webpage</uri>, and Gentoo users get to vote for their favorite design. A poll has been set up at the Gentoo Forums, and registered users can enter their vote <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=227589">here</uri>&nbsp;<b>no later than 8 October 2004</b>.

<title>Gentoo PPC developers meet in Germany</title>
<body>
<p>Among the remarkable things to happen at the first international Gentoo PPC developer meeting was the mere appearance of one of its participants: <mail link="kain@gentoo.org">Bryon Roche</mail>, who pioneered the port of Gentoo to the PPC platform in early 2002, had disappeared from active Gentoo development more than half a year ago when he joined the U.S. infantry. Last Thursday he was reunited with his European developer colleagues at Kransberg Castle, which is just a 20-minute drive from his German outpost...</p>

<p>Working together exclusively over IRC and mailing lists may be only a substitute for real-life interaction, but getting together in the flesh for the first time, in the Taunus mountain area just north of Frankfurt am Main, really was like meeting old friends. Only a few of the participants knew each other from FOSDEM in Brussels earlier this year, making this new opportunity attractive enough for e.g. <mail link="hansmi@gentoo.org">Michael Hanselmann</mail> from Switzerland to spontaneously decide on Thursday morning to hop on the next train to Frankfurt to be there, too. <mail link="dholm@gentoo.org">David Holm</mail> (Sweden) and <mail link="lu_zero@gentoo.org">Luca Barbato</mail> (Italy) had attended the <uri link="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?nodeId=02VS0llCc5pzMP2861">Freescale Smart Networks Developer Forum</uri> in Frankfurt since Tuesday, and <mail link="pylon@gentoo.org">Lars Weiler</mail> (Germany) and <mail link="dams@gentoo.org">Damien Krotkine</mail> (France) joined for the last day of that conference, dedicated to introductory seminars for the recipients of free PegasosPPC desktop computers handed out by the organizers. Four of those donated Pegasos machines (with Debian and Yellow Dog Linux plus the exotic MorphOS operating system pre-installed) ended up at the castle, one of them not lasting 10 minutes before a Gentoo LiveCD was spinning on it. Like G.I. Kain, <mail link="pvdabeel@gentoo.org">Pieter van den Abeele</mail> and <mail link="sejo@gentoo.org">Jochen Maes</mail> (both from Belgium) and guest dev <mail link="beejay@gentoo.org">Benjamin Judas</mail> (Germany), the release engineer for x86, only came to attend the Gentoo gathering.</p>

           short="PegasosPPC running Gentoo" 
           caption="Screen shot of a Pegasos desktop PC running Gentoo Linux from a PPC-LiveCD" />
<p>On top of the Gentoo PPC meeting's agenda was the release engineering for 2004.3, centering on questions like choosing udev for device handling, and whether to address hardware issues in the kernel. Pvdabeel announced a new KDE/Gnome LiveDVD for PPC, SeJo reported from talks he had had with Benjamin Herrenschmidt, the PPC kernel maintainer, and motioned for Java 1.5 to be masked at this stage, because of its lack of backward compatibility. A tentative roadmap for PPC development in 2005 was also drafted, and old and new reponsibilities were discussed and assigned to individual developers. </p>

           caption="Hansmi, dholm and sejo" />
<p>Amid all the serious talk there was space and time enough for recreation, of course. Pvdabeel and SeJo had cleverly thought in advance to bring Belgian beer in quantities that would have been enough, all truth told, to entertain twice as many people. Photos of the event including a few shots of the scenery surrounding the castle, the insides of donated PegasosPPCs, and mug shots of all attendants are <uri link="http://www.sejo.be/kransberg">here</uri>, and even more are <uri link="http://rift.ath.cx/~avatar/SNDF/">here</uri>, including lots of pictures from SNDF.</p>

<title>Nvidia Nforce network chipset driver change in Portage</title>
<body>
<p><mail link="dsd@gentoo.org">Daniel Drake</mail> announced last week that the proprietary <path>nforce-net</path> driver currently in Portage would be removed in favour of its open-source alternative <path>forcedeth</path>. Forcedeth contains fixes to those bugs in nforce-net that nobody outside of Nvidia was able to address, and it is also supported by Nvidia itself, which recently provided some important patches to the reverse-engineered code of the Forcedeth project. <uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~dsd/nforce-net-to-forcedeth.htm">DSD's developer space on gentoo.org</uri> contains instructions for Gentoo users on replacing the driver.

<p><b>Newcomers and etc-update</b></p>
<p>
Using etc-update properly is vital to the ongoing stability of your Gentoo system.  However, 
at the same time it can be one of the most confusing aspects for people new to Gentoo.  Many
other distributions do the "work" of maintaining most of the configuration files,
however Gentoo's hands-on approach requires gaining sufficient knowledge to surf through the
/etc directory and at least know what the files are for. This thread was started by a Gentoo
newcomer who accidentally overwrote most of his /etc configuration files, and it discusses methods
for recovering as well as some handy etc-update use tips.

<p><b>Non-root emerges</b></p>
<p>The possibilities and security implications of non-root (i.e. normal user) emerges were discussed in this thread. Portage has limited support ("userpriv" and "sandbox" features), but the installation of software needs root privileges at some point.</p>

<p><b>Removing dhcpcd from system?</b></p>
<p>This long thread weighed the pros and cons of having dhcpcd as part of the system profile, drifting off to a discussion of what needs to be part of the base system in the first place.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Integrating the hardened toolchain and better NTPL support</b></p>
<p><mail link="lv@gentoo.org">Travis Tilley</mail> caught the list's attention with two topics this week: "Recent gcc ebuilds have been patched to recognise an environment variable, GCC_SPECS, that sets which specs-file should be used. The gcc 3.4.2-r2 ebuild also builds both hardened and non-hardened specs files for all users," in reference to the efforts for integrating the hardened toolchain to Gentoo, and concerning support for NTPL: "[The ebuild] builds glibc twice, once with and once without nptl. The nptl libs go into lib/tls where they belong and are used by default when using a 2.6 kernel and LD_ASSUME_KERNEL isn't set."</p>

<p>
<b>Italy: Gentoo installation week at University of Bologna</b>
</p>

<p>It is only open to registered students of information science at Bologna's university, but it is a highly interesting initiative: During the entire week of 11 to 15 October, weathered Gentooists of the faculty will provide an "assisted installation" of Gentoo Linux on their co-ed's PCs. For those who have access to it, all the necessary details are to be had via the university's internal newsgroup, unibo.cs.students. Although it is of immediate benefit only to a limited audience this time, the event doubles as a dress rehearsal for a planned public Bolognese "Gentoo Installation Week" in the near future.</p>

<title>Some pretty .bashrc hints</title>
<body>
<p>This week we cover some nice to know bash tips that in my opinion every user should know of.</p>
<p>Do not remember a command you typed in a few days ago and can not find it because it has already been removed from your <path>.bash_history</path>? Then it is time to increase the number of lines bash keeps in its history file.</p>
<pre caption="&#126;/.bashrc"><codenote># Keep 1000 lines in .bash_history (default is 500)</codenote>
export HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTFILESIZE=1000</pre>
<note>To find commands in your history easily use the ctrl+r shortcut to reverse-search your .bash_history as you type.</note>
<p>If you want to stop bash from creating a history file simply add <e>export HISTFILE=/dev/null</e> to your <path>.bashrc</path>.</p>
<p>Another nice tip is to put <e>export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups</e> into your <path>.bashrc</path> that will stop bash from caching duplicate lines.</p>
