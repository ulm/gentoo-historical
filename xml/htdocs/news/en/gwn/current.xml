<title>April fools</title>
<body>
<p>
Impossible to catch all IT-related April fool's jokes this year, they were 
everywhere, on Google, OpenBSD, some even found their way into Gentoo ebuilds. 
One seems to have qualified for the 2005 best of April fool's shortlist at many 
publications: The <uri link="http://gentooexperimental.org/nt">GeNToo project</uri>, 
Gentoo for the NT kernel, alas, is a complete and utter joke. If you believed a word 
of it, you've been had.
</p>
<p>
Of the <uri link="#doc_chap3_sect2">several pranks played at Gentoo</uri> this year, 
the GeNToo plot was the most elaborate, and actually dating back to a group of three 
developers splitting away from the rest of the lot at FOSDEM in February for a 
spontaneous hacking and belgian fries session: <mail link="karltk@gentoo.org">Karl 
Trygve Kalleberg</mail>, <mail link="patrick@gentoo.org">Patrick Lauer</mail> and <mail 
link="genone@gentoo.org">Marius Mauch</mail>. Under the influence of too many Belgian 
fries, karltk was the first to point out the epiphany hidden in the name of the project: 
"You see, when you write 'Gentoo', it has NT in the middle," said the Norwegian developer. 
And thinking aloud: "Now if one took the NT kernel ... there <e>is</e> a POSIX 
layer for it ... put Portage on it ..." As he drew the surreal picture in increasingly shrill 
colors, the three devs quickly realized that the only possible release date for this 
particularly fine piece of vaporware would have to be the first of April.
</p> 
<p>
So, with the idea floating since February, there was time to back the story up with
ample documentation and even screenshots (which were taken from VMware during a 
regular boot of Windows 2000 in "Safe Mode"), with a coating of a handmade bootlog 
text that was a rather good approximation of how <c>emerge info</c> might actually 
look on such a system.
</p>
<p>
When the announcement was posted to the website and the topics of two IRC channels 
almost simultaneously around noon UTC, the traffic statistics on the website where 
the project description was hosted went simply through the ceiling. An amazingly 
constant stream of traffic, weighing in at around one hit per second or 100MB per hour, 
was sustained over almost the entire day -- considering that the whole website is  only 
165KB, estimations are that the GeNToo hoax got around 600 visitors per hour. 
</p>

	short="Screenshot" 
	caption="Traffic load on the fake GeNToo project pages: Slashdot effect after 22:00" />
<p>
To make the illusion even more believable, a channel on Freenode was created, too: 
<path>#gentoo-nt</path>, the perfect place to discuss something that didn't even 
exist. An interesting twist came about when some of the first to be fooled later 
turned into devoted GeNToo evangelists, perpetuating the myth in the IRC channel 
and taking the charade even further: One produced "a patched NT kernel" and offered 
it online at his own website. When looked at closely, it bore a striking familiarity 
with a 2.6.11 Linux kernel, but nevertheless -- declared as a "GeNToo binary" -- found 
many curious downloaders.
</p>
<p>
While the <path>#gentoo-nt</path> channel on Freenode was still continuing 
its makebelief stance well past the dateline into Saturday 2 April, nobody 
was sad when the atrocities behind the other prominent Gentoo April fool's joke 
were taken down again. People who had followed <uri 
link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-317053.html">the announcement</uri> in 
the Gentoo forums that the redesign had now been finished and could be applied by 
simply switching the user profile, quickly complained about headache, sudden bursts 
of claustro- and other phobia. Small wonder, looking at the effect the "redesign" 
had on posts:</p>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20050404_forum.png"
	short="Screenshot" 
	caption="Kallamej's announcement, rendered in the freshly redesigned Forum layout" />
<p>
Reactions were mixed, while some people figured out the joke pretty fast, others 
complained about eyestrain. While moderators were watching and merging duplicated spawn to <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-317056.html">the central thread</uri>, they 
decided to create even more confusion by renaming moderators to "Ninjas" and administrators to "Ninja Masters". Bodhisatvas (the rank for ex-mods and -admins) decided not to follow this trend -- and were renamed to HAL 9000. How subtle moderator interference at the forums really is was best displayed by the fact that it took almost all day before people <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-317461.html">started noticing</uri> the change!

<title>emerge webrsync reloaded</title>
<body>
<p>
Portage developer <mail link="ferringb@gentoo.org">Brian Harring</mail> has
implemented a more resource-friendly version of <c>emerge webrsync</c>.
Instead of pulling in the whole tarball, it only uses compressed patches
between (daily) versions. That way a user can keep up-to-date with only
minimal overhead even when <c>rsync</c> is not available (firewalls and dialup
users mostly). A description and howto can be found at <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~ferringb/blog/archives/2005-03.html#e2005-03-29T17_14_42.txt"> his blog</uri>. 
First estimates give up to 99% bandwidth saved compared to <c>webrsync</c>.

<title>Donations surpassing expectations</title>
<body>
<p>
Last week's announcement of the return of PayPal donations has triggered a
delightful response from the community, as Corey Shields, one of the trustees 
of the Gentoo Foundation, has reported last week.</p>
<p>The opening balance for the bank account was spontaneously paid in full 
by Gentoo sponsor Genesi, who wired an advance payment on commissions for the
sales of PegasosPPC Open Desktop Workstations.</p>

<title>"Why Gentoo? It's cool." -- Michael Hanselmann (hansmi)</title>
<body>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20050404_hansmi.jpg"
	short="hansmi" 
	caption="Michael Hanselmann aka hansmi" />

<p>
This weeks featured dev is Michael Hanselmann, known to most as <mail 
link="hansmi@gentoo.org">hansmi</mail>. He does "various stuff" 
in Gentoo/PPC, Gentoo/HPPA and the <c>qmail</c> herd, which mostly 
boils down to marking packages stable, fixing bugs and hanging out 
on IRC a lot. He is the administrator of a hosting experiment (a project 
called <uri link="http://www.forkbomb.ch">forkbomb.ch</uri>), has
written <uri link="http://www.hansmi.ch/software">some software of his own</uri>, 
used to do some work with <c>fli4l</c> and still does busy himself
with the <c>m0n0wall</c> project, but his greatest contributions he still 
sees in Gentoo, including a stint on the Mac OS X team where he contributed a
Mac OS panel application for setting Portage preferences.
</p>
<p>
Currently he is doing a programmer apprenticeship in Liechtenstein which 
will be finished this summer -- job offers in Switzerland are therefore 
highly appreciated! His favourite applications are the <c>vim</c>, <c>mutt</c> 
and <c>qmail</c>, which all runs somewhere on a heterogenous mix of 
<path>x86</path>, <path>sparc</path>, <path>hppa</path> and <path>ppc</path>, 
with <c>fluxbox</c> quite possibly being the only element that binds them all 
together. Asked what the first application to launch after he boots his systems,
he insists on an appropriately geeky answer: "Technically, <path>/sbin/init</path> 
is the first application I (or my kernel) launches at startup. Or maybe you mean 
<c>bash</c> when logging in. In a graphical environment, it's <c>aterm</c> and 
<c>ssh</c>." 
</p>
<p>
In those rare moments when he is not attached to computer peripherals he fiddles 
with electronics, building or breaking stuff, and sometimes really considers "real" 
life less interesting than computers.

<p><b>Banned from OTW</b></p>
<p>A new feature, originally introduced by ex-developer Christian Hartmann and 
available to forum administrators since about a month ago has now been officially 
announced to the public. The OTW ban button provides the forum admins with a 
finer-grained ability to ban someone for disregarding the guidelines for postings 
in Off the Wall, while leaving their ID intact and activated for posts in the 
technical support forums. People can be hotheads and still eager (and competent) 
to help others with their Linux problems. Until the new feature was introduced, 
banning resulted in a full ban from the forums altogether.

<p><b>The Pluggable Hell - PAM</b></p>

<mail link="flameeyes@users.berlios.de">Diego Petten√≤</mail> explains
his work with getting PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to behave
the same on non-Linux Gentoos as on normal Linux. For anyone interested
in porting software this should be an interesting read, showing how
small differences can make you life really difficult when trying to get
something to work properly ...

<p><b>GTK / GTK2 USE flag madness</b></p>

As it happens every 6 months or so, a discussion on the (ab)use and the
combinations of GTK and GTK2 USEflags was started. There are many ideas
to improve the situation, but no real consensus on what "-gtk gtk2"
would mean has been reached (yet)

<title>Gentoo in the press</title>
<section>
<title>NewsForge (28 March 2005)</title>
<body>
<p>
Bruce Byfield discusses the upcoming OpenOffice.org version 2.0 and the 
implications of its move towards Java: "Since Java's license is neither free 
nor open source, a small but vocal minority has responded both strongly and 
negatively," says Byfield, and explains in detail why there are fears of 
platform support for OOo falling apart (FreeBSD and Linux for PPC, for example, 
currently "have no official version of Java," as he notes), and of alienating 
users. In his article with the provocative title <uri 
link="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/03/22/204244&amp;tid=93">"Java 
fallout: OpenOffice.org 2.0 and the FOSS community"</uri>, he looks at the 
plans at major distributors of how to go about the issue of OOoand Java 
inclusion, he quotes Gentoo developer <mail link="pauldv@gentoo.org">Paul de 
Vrieze</mail> as preferring an open-source implementation of Java such as GCJ, 
but being open to include Java proper if no alternative is available.
