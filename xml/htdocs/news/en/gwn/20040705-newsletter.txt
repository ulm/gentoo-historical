Gentoo announces web redesign contest
-------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Foundation has announced plans to redesign the various web 
sites that are part of the Gentoo community with a new, universal theme. 
Being a community-based distribution, we decided to solicit submissions 
for the new look and feel from our users. 
 
We are officially opening the Gentoo Foundation Web Redesign Contest[1]. 
This contest gives you, as a Gentoo user, the ability to design the new 
look and feel that will define Gentoo Linux for the imediate future. The 
winning design will be selected by the community via an open voting 
process. For full details, please see our contest guidelines[2].

Bootsplash now working on PPC
-----------------------------
  
We're very pleased to announce that bootsplash is now working in PPC. 
Bootsplash[3] is a kernel patch that allows images to be displayed during 
the boot seqeunce in addition to or in lieu of traditional boot messages. 
Thanks to developer Michael Januszewski[4]'s hard work, bootsplash is now 
independent of vesa-framebuffer. The latest ebuild 
(media-gfx/bootsplash-0.6.1-r4) is now ~ppc-masked, and the 
bootsplash_patch works on development-sources (the patch will be included 
in gentoo-development-sources soon). For more information, see the bug 
report[5] and forum discussion[6].

mit-krb5: Multiple buffer overflows in krb5_aname_to_localname
--------------------------------------------------------------
  
mit-krb5 contains multiple buffer overflows in the function 
krb5_aname_to_localname(). This could potentially lead to a complete 
remote system compromise. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[7]

Pavuk: Remote buffer overflow
-----------------------------
  
Pavuk contains a bug potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary 
code. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[8]

Esearch: Insecure temp file handling
------------------------------------
  
The eupdatedb utility in esearch creates a file in /tmp without first 
checking for symlinks. This makes it possible for any user to create 
arbitrary files. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[9]

Linux Kernel: Multiple vulnerabilities
--------------------------------------
  
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Linux kernel used by 
GNU/Linux systems. Patched, or updated versions of these kernels have been 
released and details are included in this advisory. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[10]

Apache 2: Remote denial of service attack
-----------------------------------------
  
A bug in Apache may allow a remote attacker to perform a Denial of Service 
attack. With certain configurations this could lead to a heap based buffer 
overflow. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[11]

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
   
Joshua Kinard
 
Figure 3.1: Joshua Kinard

This week, we feature Joshua Kinard[13], who goes by kumba due to a 
fascination with the "Kumba" roller coaster at Busch Gardens, Tampa Bay. 
Joshua serves as the team leader for the MIPS project[14], although he 
describes that role as being just "another part of the MIPS teams ...we 
all work together to keep Gentoo running on what some might consider the 
strange MIPS architecture." Some readers may be more familiar with MIPS as 
a processor architecture that powers the Silicon Graphics workstation. 
Joshua has also contributed some porting work for the Sparc processor, and 
serves as a member of the embedded[15], base-system[16] and toolchain 
herds. Joshua's work for the MIPS project consists of maintaining the 
mips-sources kernel tree ebuilds, porting ebuilds, recruiting developers, 
building the netboot images and contributing to the Cobalt port. He also 
works on the Sparc toolchain, and contributed the crossdev script for 
building cross-compiler environments.

 16. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/index.xml
 
Joshua first heard about Linux six or seven years ago, although at the 
time he confesses he and his friends "thought it was some kind of Windows 
add-on." After learning more, he was intrigued and purchased a boxed 
version of Red Hat 5.2. He also had access to a remote server shell 
account, which gave him the opportunity to become familiar with the Linux 
command line. In late 2001, he acquired a Sun Blade-100 System that he 
intended to install Linux on. Red Hat's Sparc port was defunct, so he was 
shopping for a distro for the new system. He remembered "an obscure 
distribution mentioned in an IRC channel" and installed it. He's been 
using Gentoo ever since. In 2003, his interest in helping Jan Seidel[17] 
implement a MIPS port was noticed, and he was asked to join the team as a 
developer. This was not his first Open Source project - he is also the 
author of Program Killer[18], a Windows application for blocking spyware, 
P2P, IM traffic or other applications, based on administrative settings. 

 17. tuxus@gentoo.org
 18. http://sourceforge.net/projects/progkill/
 
Given his role as a developer, Joshua's eclectic collection of computers 
should provoke no surprise. In addition to the Sun Blade mentioned 
earlier, he has an SGI Indigo2 , an SGI Indy, a SGI O2 and a Cobalt 
Microserver - all running Linux. Two other SGI boxen and a Sun 
SPARCstation are currently not in use. His collection is rounded out by a 
dual PIII system running Windows 2000. Under Linux, he claims the tools he 
uses are fairly prosaic. He does confess to a fondness for Mozilla 
Mail[19], the StormLab[20] doppler radar information client and the art of 
Greg Martin[21].

Joshua recently completed a degree in Computer and Information Sciences at 
the University of Maryland University College. He also worked at a local 
College Computer lab providing user support and system administration. He 
has commenced the usual post-graduation job search, hoping for a job where 
he "can apply [his] computing/Linux knowledge." He is a "bona fide geek", 
with few non-computer related hobbies. This is reflected in his use of 
Middle Earth place names for his servers. He also confesses to the common 
geek fondness for Babylon 5, and quoted the former Centauri Emperor for a 
favorite saying: "The past tempts us, the present confuses us, the future 
frightens us. Our lives slip away, moment by moment, lost in that terrible 
in between."

Flavour of the Week: 3D Desktops 
 
Reading the hardware requirements (2 GHz CPU and 512 RAM minimum) may turn 
off many veteran Linux users, but Sun's new desktop Looking Glass[22] was 
put under the GNU public license last week, reason enough to be cheered on 
by many Gentoo Forum posters. Sailing in the wake of Sun's mother ship, a 
somewhat lighter French 3D solution called Metisse[23], based on a virtual 
X server and a modified FVWM window manager , is being discussed almost as 
enthusiastically:

=======================
   
USA: Linux World Expo in San Francisco 
 
Four more weeks to go before the Californian franchise of the Linux World 
Expo[29] opens its gates, at the Moscone Center[30] in downtown San 
Francisco, from 2 to 5 August 2004. Just like last year, Gentoo will be 
present inside the exposition hall, this year at booth number 270 (floor 
plan available as PDF[31]). Besides the exhibition, you will not want to 
miss Greg Kroah-Hartman, udev maintainer and Gentoo developer in his own 
right, battle it out with Andrew Morton, Timothy Widham from OSDL and 
three open source evangelists from Apple in an OSS trivia quiz called the 
"Golden Penguin Bowl". Corey Shields from the Gentoo infrastructure team 
is on the speaker's list, with a presentation on "High Performance Linux 
Storage Management", and he has also set up a Gentoo Community Meeting[32] 
on day two of the show (3 August 2004 from 17:30 to 19:00): a BoF (Birds 
of a Feather) gathering for all Gentoo afficionados, developers and users 
alike, which will also include a GPG keysigning party. Contact Corey[33] 
for details about the procedure.
