<title>GWN Staff seeking writing help</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo Weekly Newsletter is staffed solely by volunteers from both the
developer and user communities. While the team does have a good number of active
and helpful writers from the community, it still needs more help. Each week, the
GWN is delayed due to the lack of articles being submitted. This causes the
staff to have to hunt down articles, which is a very time-consuming job. This is
where you come into the picture. The GWN is looking for people from the
community to join our writing staff to submit articles on a regular basis. The
team is specifically looking for people to cover the following areas:
</p>

<ul>
<li>planet.gentoo.org summaries</li>
<li>gentoo-dev mailing list summaries</li>
<li>gentoo-project mailing list summaries</li>
<li>gentoo-user mailing list summaries</li>
<li>forums.gentoo.org summaries</li>
<li>Gentoo in the Press</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, articles covering other areas, such as Gentoo News and Tips and
Tricks are always welcome. Articles should be submitted in plain text or proper
GuideXML. If you are not familiar with GuideXML, please submit in plain text.
Please do not submit articles in HTML.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in having your work published, have a few hours a week to
spare, and can read and write English, the GWN would love to hear from you.
Just send an email to <mail>gwn-feedback@gentoo.org</mail> and one of the staff
will get back to you as soon as possible.

<title>Gentoo package moves</title>

<section>

<p>
This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri
link="/proj/en/qa/treecleaners">Treecleaners</uri> and various developers. Most
packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
