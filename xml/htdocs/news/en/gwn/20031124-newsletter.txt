Gentoo Managers' Meeting Summary - 17 November 2003
---------------------------------------------------
  
A log[1] and summary[2] of last week's Managers' Meeting have been posted 
on the Gentoo Managers' Meetings[3] page. During the meeting, three issues 
were discussed before the floor was opened. First, Daniel Robbins[4] spoke 
about Catalyst, a new system for building LiveCDs and stage tarballs. 
Catalyst, a rewrite of the original "stager" code used to build the 
stage1, stage2, and stage3 tarballs, will be a single modular program able 
to reliably and repeatably build stages, livecds, and package sets for all 
architectures. Next, Sven Vermeulen[5] announced that the installation 
section of the Gentoo Handbook[6] was ready for mass consumption. Finally, 
infrastructure lead Kurt Lieber[7] asked what was being done to facilitate 
QA for Gentoo, and was answered by Seemant Kulleen[8], who said that 
releng was handling QA by developing catalyst and similar tools, and that 
ideas were being tossed around in #gentoo-qa and in conversations with 
developers.

Gentoo Desktop update
---------------------
  
Status Report
 
There has been quite a bit of work done in the Gentoo Desktop world during 
the last several weeks. A number of developers from the Gentoo Desktop 
team have banded together to ensure that every package pertaining to 
running Gentoo on the desktop is sufficiently maintained. This team has 
begun forming new herds (collections of related ebuilds maintained by a 
group of interested developers), updating forgotten packages to newer 
versions, testing said packages, marking some of them stable, and closing 
bugs. The current target categories are x11-misc, x11-wm, and x11-plugins.
 
Who wants to be a Gentoo Developer?
 
We are looking for at least two intelligent, dedicated people to join in 
this effort. First, the KDE team is short of help, and would appreciate an 
able volunteer. Second, the gnustep herd, which comprises gnustep, 
afterstep, windowmaker, and some related apps, is fairly inactive, so we 
would like one more person to fill this position. Other positions may be 
available, so don't hesitate to contact tseng on IRC at #gentoo-desktop, 
or send an email to Brandon Hale[9]. 

 9. tseng@gentoo.org
 
Qualified applicants will preferably be long-time users of Linux as a 
desktop OS. Strong troubleshooting skills are required, as the selected 
applicants will be working to resolve bug reports from other users. 
Familiarity with Bugzilla and cvs are also a plus, and fluency in the 
English language is greatly preferred.

3. Gentoo Security
==================
  
GLSA: apache
------------
  
Quote from http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/Announcement:
 
This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release. A 
partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document. A 
full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file. Of particular 
note is that 1.3.29 addresses and fixes 1 potential security issue:
 
 * CAN-2003-0542 (cve.mitre.org): Fix buffer overflows in mod_alias and 
mod_rewrite which occurred if one configured a regular expression with 
more than 9 captures.
 
We consider Apache 1.3.29 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available 
and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of the 
1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible. No further releases 
will be made in the 1.2.x family.
 
 * Packages Affected: <apache-1.3.29 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge -pv apache; emerge 
'>=net-www/apache-1.3.29'; emerge clean; /etc/init.d/apache restart 
 * GLSA Announcement[10] 
 10. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.announce/263

    
GLSA: kdebase
-------------
  
Firstly, versions of KDM <= 3.1.3 are vulnerable to a privilege escalation 
bug with a specific configuration of PAM modules. Users who do not use PAM 
with KDM and users who use PAM with regular Unix crypt/MD5 based 
authentication methods are not affected.
 
Secondly, KDM uses a weak cookie generation algorithm. It is advised that 
users upgrade to KDE 3.1.4, which uses /dev/urandom as a non-predictable 
source of entropy to improve security.
 
Please look at http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030916-1.txt 
for the KDE Security Advisory and source patch locations for older 
versions of KDE.
 
 * Packages Affected: <=3.1.3 
 * Rectification: emerge --sync; emerge '>=kde-base/kde-3.1.4'; emerge 
clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[11] 
 11. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.announce/264

    
GLSA: opera
-----------
  
The Opera browser can cause a buffer allocated on the heap to overflow 
under certain HREFs when rendering HTML. The mail system is also deemed 
vulnerable and an attacker can send an email containing a malformed HREF, 
or plant the malicious HREF on a web site.
 
Please see http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/a102003-1.txt 
for further details.
 
 * Severity: High - buffer overflows rendering certain HREFs 
 * Packages Affected: 7.11, 7.20 
 * Rectification: emerge --sync; emerge '>=net-www/opera-7.22'; emerge 
clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[12] 
 12. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.announce/265

    
GLSA: hylafax
-------------
  
During a code review of the hfaxd server, the SuSE Security Team 
discovered a format bug condition that allows a remote attacker to execute 
arbitrary code as the root user. However, the bug cannot be triggered in 
the default hylafax configuration.
 
SuSE-SA:2003:045 outlines the problem, and is available at 
http://lwn.net/Articles/57562/
 
 * Severity: Normal - Remote code exploit untriggerable in default 
configuration 
 * Packages Affected: <=4.1.7 
 * Rectification: emerge --sync; emerge '>=net-misc/hylafax-4.1.8'; emerge 
clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[13]

Beyond X
 
"Can I use this without blowing a hole in my PC?" was the spontaneous 
first reaction to port001[17]'s announcement of ebuilds for Keith 
Packard's alternative Xserver[18] (formerly known as kdrive), including 
the Render extension and a 32 bits X Visual for presenting alpha-blended 
content to the screen. The forum thread started last Sunday, is quite 
lively and an absolute must for anyone who wants to have a go at 
translucent windows... The ebuild's actual author spyderous[19] and thread 
initiator port001 are still around answering questions:

Power Profiles for Laptops
 
Well rooted in the tradition of donating excellent documentation to the 
Forum section of the same name, optilude[22] has deposited a collection of 
scripts for power management on laptop and notebooks, addressing CPU 
frequency throttles and backlight adjustments, but potentially including 
other funtions, too.:

Dangers of unmerging?
 
Quoting the Portage Manual: 'Unmerging packages can be dangerous...removal 
of various libraries may cause software to fail". User list member Jason 
presented that this is a fundamental shortcoming in Portage. Check out how 
others felt about this topic  here[24].

Vienna Gentoo Linux Users Group (VGLUG) Meeting in December
 
The Vienna crowd continues to pick the strangest of places for their 
venues. This time (Tuesday 2 December, 19:00 hours) it's going to be at 
the Cafe Oskar[25], a peculiar joint where - judging from the pictures on 
their website - part of the crowd consistently seems to enjoy dancing on 
tables while being inappropriately clad for temperatures outside. Stow 
those notebooks away, Gentoomen... Questions, remarks, RSVPs to the Forum 
coordination thread[26].

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Killing a Hung Virtual Console
 
This week's tip shows you how to restore a hung virtual console (without 
rebooting). To do this, you need sys-apps/lsof from portage.
 
Using lsof, find the login processes of the hung console.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.1:                                                       |
|Example: (hung console is                                                |
/dev/vc/3)-----------------------------------------------------------------

|# lsof /dev/vc/3                                                         |
|COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME                    |
|login    7114  root    0u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|login    7114  root    1u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|login    7114  root    2u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|zsh     30630 david    0u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|zsh     30630 david    1u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|zsh     30630 david    2u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|zsh     30630 david   10u   CHR    4,3        17 /dev/vc/3               |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Kill the processes associated with this login and the console should 
respawn.
