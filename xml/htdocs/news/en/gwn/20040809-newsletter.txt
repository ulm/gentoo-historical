Gentoo at Linux World Expo
--------------------------
  
Marking our fourth consecutive Linux World Expo, Gentoo Linux was on hand 
at the recent San Francisco event. As with previous shows, the Gentoo 
booth was located in the .org pavillion. Nominated for the Best Open 
Source Solution (though beaten out by Firefox), the Gentoo booth was quite 
busy throughout the show. With a mixture of new people wanting to find out 
more about Gentoo and veteran users thanking the developers for their hard 
work, the show allowed Gentoo to reach out to users new and old. Another 
benefit was the chance for many of the Gentoo developers to meet 
face-to-face for the first time. 
 
Also at the show, a Birds of a Feather meeting was held, which is an 
informal, after-hours meeting where users had a chance to interact with 
the developers on a one-to-one basis. This meeting drew far larger numbers 
than were originally expected, with over 50 people in attendance.
 
To all the folks who stopped by the Gentoo booth, thank you for showing 
your support. To anyone who was unable to make it, we'll be at the next 
Linux World Expo in Boston, February 14th through 17th! 
 
Update on the Gentoo Website Redesign
-------------------------------------
  
As an update to the previously announced[1] website redesign contest, a 
number of excellent submissions were received from our users. Overall, we 
had more than two dozen responses from which five have been selected as 
finalists. We are currently awaiting confirmation from those finalists 
that they are indeed willing to complete their design and participate in 
the actual project. As soon as we have those confirmations, we will post 
the five finalists and allow the community to select a winner.

DVD Burning under Linux
 
DVD burning under Linux has become easier and easier in the past months 
due to the enhancements in the 2.6 kernel series. Yet, the issues are 
still there--but now due to the myriad of DVD-burning drives. DVD+R, 
DVD-R, single-layer, dual-layer, etc. Scott Taylor did the list a favor 
with a great write up that sums up the differences, as well as a 
recommendation on the type of drive he prefers. Also check out the related 
thread on dual-layer burners.

"Weird" Executables in /bin
 
What's that left-bracket doing there in /bin? If you're curious, check out 
this thread[8].

Upgrading Perl
 
Do you rebuild your perl libraries after an upgrade? You should! Although 
indispensable as a scripting and admin tool, upgrading perl involves a 
good number of reverse dependencies. Gentoo provides the libperl_rebuilder 
script (/usr/portage/dev-lang/perl/files/libperl_rebuilder) which can 
allieviate some of the issues and keep your perl running smoothly. 
However, if you happen to be using "ACCEPT_KEYWORDS" there may experience 
some problems. List member Holly Bostick and our resident developer 
Spider, help clear up the confusion and make the upgrade process easier.

For Real: Realplayer 10 
 
Real Networks[10] announced last Monday that their latest release, 
RealPlayer 10 Gold, is now available to Linux users. RealPlayer 10 is 
identical to the fully open-sourced Helix Player 1.0[11] (released on the 
same day), but has added support for Real's own audio and video formats, 
MP3 and Flash playback. While Gentoo users in the Forum have greeted the 
news with excitement, an official RealPlayer ebuild will have to wait for 
Gentoo develeoper Chris White do quality checks and get Real's endorsement 
for inclusion of their flagship application in the Portage tree. If you 
want to help Chris conducting the necessary tests, contact him by 
email[12]:

Useful USE Tools 
 
Italian Forum user xchris[14] has written a handy bash script that 
analyzes which packages have been compiled with or without a supported USE 
flag, available for download at his own website. In case you forgot to 
include an important feature in several packages, you might like to simply 
redirect the output of "usetool -nu [use flag] -nc" straight to emerge. 
And if you'd like to know what USE flags actually are being supported by 
packages first, try singular[15]'s concise Python script (based on 
gentoolkit) that puts an end to the old recursive grepping routine people 
had to rely on so far: 
 
 * TOOL - Usetool for useflag analisys[16] 
 * finduse Python script[17]

Italy: MOCA Reminder, 20-22 August 
 
Ten days before MOCA, the Italian geek camp[18], opens its 
doo^H^H^Hflysheets in Pescara, and as many as seventeen Gentoo users have 
confirmed their participation in this event organised by Metro Olografix 
activists on the Adriatic coast. If you're interested in joining in the 
fun, check our earlier report[19] for details, and let the others know 
you're coming at this forum thread[20] (in Italian, preferrably).

At DEFCON 12 this past weekend, several Gentoo Linux machines were sighted 
in the RootFu[21] competition. Gentoo's "less is more" attitude for Stage1 
installs makes it advantageous for security-minded folks. There were other 
Gentoo sightings as well: Several of the conferences used Gentoo machines 
for demonstrations, and many were sighted on user's laptops.
