<title>virtual/mysql Introduced</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to adjust to changes in upstream release policies, the former
<c>dev-db/mysql</c> has been split into <c>dev-db/mysql-community</c> and 
<c>virtual/mysql</c> (which depends on the presence of either
<c>dev-db/mysql-community</c> or <c>dev-db/mysql</c>).
</p> 

<p>
If emerge complains about needing <c>virtual/mysql</c>, just install it.
Assuming you already have mysql or mysql-community installed, there's no
compiling required.
</p> 

<p>
If you want to stay at mysql 4.<e>x</e> for some reason, be sure to mask
<c>virtual/mysql</c> in <path>/etc/portage/package.keywords</path>.
</p>

<p>
If you don't want the greatest stable version, but want to stay at mysql
4.<e>x</e>, for example, be sure to mask <c>>=virtual/mysql-4.1</c>,
<c>>=dev-db/mysql-4.1</c> and <c>>=dev-db/mysql-community-4.1</c> in
<path>/etc/portage/package.mask</path>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to compile mysql client-only, you need to use the <c>minimal</c>
USE flag.

<p><b>Coldplug deprecated by udev-103 update?/udev and coldplug blocking each
other!</b></p>

<p>
Two different users found themselves concerned by the recent demise of
coldplug, the package which formerly handled devices which are already
connected at the time the system is booted. Peter K was assured that he'd read
his <c>emerge --sync</c> output correctly and that, as of udev 103, coldplug
was indeed gone.
</p>

<p>
Hans de Hertog found himself more concerned by the mutual blocks that udev and
coldplug seemed to have thrown up:
</p>

<pre caption="blocker output">
[blocks B ] >=sys-fs/udev-089 (is blocking sys-apps/coldplug-20040920-r1)
[blocks B ] sys-apps/coldplug (is blocking sys-fs/udev-103)
[ebuild U ] sys-fs/udev-103 [087-r1] USE="(-selinux)" 195 kB
</pre>

<p>
Hans was assured that the recently stabilized udev 103 was an entire
replacement for coldplug. Plucking up his courage, he unmerged coldplug, merged
udev 103 and cleaned up by deleting <path>/etc/init.d/coldplug</path> and
running <c>rc-update del coldplug</c>. As a bonus, he discovered it was no
longer necessary to edit <path>/lib/rcscripts/addons/udev-start.sh</path> to
have udev handle coldplugging.

</ul>

<p><b>Where is DISPLAYMANAGER="gdm" now?</b></p>

<p>
Mark Knecht had just completed his GCC 4 upgrade and discovered that the
DISPLAYMANAGER="gdm" statement was no longer in <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>. To
what file it had been spirited away?
</p>

<p>
To <path>/etc/conf.d/xdm</path> although (as noted in
<path>/etc/conf.d/xdm</path>) setting DISPLAYMANAGER in
<path>/etc/rc.conf</path> overrides <path>/etc/conf.d/xdm</path>.
</p>

<p>
Mark thanked all the responders and noted that he'd be using
<path>/etc/conf.d/xdm</path> as he wanted to do it the Gentoo way.

<p><b>Interrupting portage gracefully</b></p>

<p>
Peter Humphreys wanted to know if there was a command to make portage stop
compiling at the end of the current package. He'd been running compiles
overnight, but was bothered by the fan noise.
</p>

<p>
Christoph Mende suggested terminating the compile with Control-C and running
<c>emerge --resume</c> the next day. Various readers proposed using suspend to
disk or suspend to RAM and picking up right where you left off the next morning.
</p>

<p>
Peter Davoust uses <c>emerge [package] &amp;&amp; init 0</c>, although
conceding it leaves the machine running if the package fails to compile. Others
suggested <c>emerge [package] ; shutdown -h now</c>. This has the opposite
problem to Peter's solution, since the machine will shutdown even if the
package fails to compile. It thus requires review of logs in the morning to
know whether the package was built or not.
