Gentoo Linux a finalist for LWE's "Best Open Source Project"
------------------------------------------------------------
  
We're very proud to announce that Gentoo Linux has been announced as a 
finalist[1] for Linux World Expo's Product Excellence Award, under the 
"Best Open Source Project" category. The other nominees are KDE 3.2, Sun's 
JXTA technology, and RealNetworks' Helix Player project. The winners are 
scheduled to be announced on Wednesday, January 21 from 4:00-5:00pm at the 
Taste of Linux Booth at the 2004 New York LWE. If you register by today, 
January 19, you'll be able to enter the exhibition hall for free, so it's 
still not too late if you're undecided about attending. If you do come, 
make sure to drop by and wish us some luck!

Gentoo Linux Desktop Project Co-leads chosen
--------------------------------------------
  
After a poll held on -core and discussions within the management teams and 
with these two developers, Donnie Berkholz[2] and Brandon Hale[3] have 
been chosen as the new co-leads for the Desktop Project[4]. The two 
co-leads will immediately begin work on getting the Desktop Project 
organized; we'd like to wish them success with this endeavor.

Our featured developer this week is Brandon Hale[5] (tseng), the lead for 
the Gentoo WM Project[6], and one of the newly appointed co-leads of the 
Gentoo Desktop Project[7]. He maintains the x11-wm/*box ebuilds and helps 
to organize the Gentoo Desktop Project, as well as working with the 
Hardened Gentoo[8] team on implementing a PaX[9] enabled desktop for 
Gentoo. He also applies himself to improving developer relations, and is 
frequently seen on IRC helping users.

Brandon lives in York, Pennsylvania. He is currently between employers, 
giving him ample time to work on Gentoo. He hopes to apply his skills at 
network security and Unix desktop support in his future career. He has 
been using Linux since 2000, with Red Hat and Debian. He moved to Gentoo 
in early 2002, after testing it on a server. After meeting Matt Keadle[10] 
and Seemant Kulleen[11] on IRC, he steadily became more involved with 
Gentoo, ultimately taking over significant responsibility for desktop and 
WM projects. He said that he was very proud of that accomplishment and the 
opportunity to "work side by side with some really great developers".

Brandon claims he is afflicted with "an odd fascination with things that 
go way too fast" - which would explain his taste for hard-core metal 
music, as well as Gentoo. He is usually connected to IRC when he is on a 
computer, and the first thing he does on waking is check his awaylog in 
irssi[12]. His favorite apps also include vim[13], gaim[14], and 
epiphany[15]. He uses gnome-session[16] with openbox3[17], and is a big 
fan of the openbox themes Brandon's friend, Merry[18] made. They are 
available in portage as x11-themes/openbox-themes. He also likes the GTK2 
themes made by Jimmac. Brandon concluded our interview by saying that he 
would "like to thank the entire community for making my experience with 
Gentoo a positive one."

At the Sound of the Falling Hammer, It's - Project Support
 
Wolvenwraith[19] may have expected a lot of things, but quite possibly not 
what happened when he started looking around for some auction management 
software for Linux. Not finding anything to please his tastes, he decided 
to drop eBay a line about possible support for open source projects, and 
guess what: Much to his and everybody else's surprise, eBay's development 
section not only said "sure, anytime" - one of their lot[20] actually 
subscribed to the Gentoo Forums right away, to offer hands-on support to 
potential open source developers for auction management software:

Rsync Round-Robin Routing to Rocalhost
 
Yet another example of the Gentoo web forums being a prime address for 
people in search of answers to severe technical problems, here are the 
threads that survived the weeding out of duplicates for the big question 
last week: Have the servers gone up in smoke?:

rsync.gentoo.org Problems 
 
The gentoo-user list had its share[24] of panicky posts[25] earlier this 
week as the primary rsync mirror had some hardware issues. As usual, the 
best policy is just to sit tight and watch the forum announcments[26].

/usr/portage to /var/portage.
 
Gentoo is always trying to keep up with standards, and the FHS[28] is no 
exception. So, should our favorite tree stay where it is, or make a move? 
Questions around portage's cache and architecture (in)dependant features 
are all discussed. Check it out.[29]

Spain: Zaurus Goes Gentoo!
 
Sharp Corporation's bold attempt at marketing Linux-based PDAs both in- 
and outside their Japanese home market was successful enough to create an 
illustrous group of followers worldwide. Some of those tried early on to 
replace the stock ROM delivered by Sharp installed on their Zaurus models 
with an alternative, either at kernel level or window management or both. 
Now a Spanish company[30], or more precisely Fernando Monera Daroqui aka 
Lekter[31] has done what many Gentooists have secretly hoped for: Gentoo 
for Zaurus v0.2 is out and about[32], giving people with any one of 
Sharp's model range an opportunity to run Portage on a handheld. Emerging 
on the Zaurus works a little differently from a desktop, of course. 
Downloading is done on the PDA, but distcc subsequently takes care of the 
actual compilation being executed on a remote workstation. A script then 
converts the binary package to the .ipk format that the Zaurus installer 
(and Familiar's[33] Linucised iPaqs, by the way) understands. For anyone 
in similar awe as the first people to react to the announcement, don't 
hold back, go express your feelings at this Forum thread[34].

Italy: Call for Participation in Webbit 2004
 
Still a few days left to think about possible topics: Contributions to 
Italy's Webbit conference[35] have to be registered before 30 January. The 
GECHI[36] lot has started rounding up the usual suspects, and they'll be 
present with one or more 50 minute talks, to be held at the first 
Webbit.con in 2004 (there are going to be three of these events in Italy 
this year), between 6 and 8 March, in Padova. There's a coordination 
thread[37] in the Forums where you can volunteer for speaking engagements.

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Using nl to number lines
 
This weeks tip shows you how to use nl to add line numbers to a file. One 
of the more common commands to add line numbers is simply cat -n. However, 
nl adds extra functionality (such as controlling for white space, zero 
padding, and column justification). 
 
To use nl with its default options, type nl filename. This will output the 
file with line numbers to standard out. Empty lines will be skipped by 
default.
