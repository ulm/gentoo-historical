Gentoo Managers' Meeting Summary - 12 Jan 2004 and 26 Jan 2004
--------------------------------------------------------------
  
Summaries and logs for the Gentoo Managers' Meetings held on 12 January 
and 26 January are now up[1].

In the meeting held on the 12th, there was no agenda but an informative 
discussion occurred nonetheless. The meeting began with Nick Carpaski[2] 
making a plea for developers to use repoman, the quality management tool 
used to maintain the quality of the CVS tree. He then announced that the 
2.0.50_pre series of Portage trees is under development and needs testing. 
After this, Alexander Gabert[3] asked if developers felt there was a need 
for more hardware for testing software and releases. While there seemed to 
be a consensus that more hardware could be used, especially non-x86 
hardware, it was also noted that it was not the only bottleneck, lack of 
manpower often being the cause of an ebuild languishing in ~arch. It was 
also pointed out that if Portage could handle cross-compiling, life would 
be much easier. Discussion then turned to what should be done if more 
hardware were available, a reasonable suggestion being a compiler farm. 
The technical details are rather fuzzy, but Alexander will be generating a 
GLEP on how remote access and authentication, possibly with VPN, could be 
performed.

The meeting held on the 26th was opened with Kurt Lieber[4] announcing a 
plan to develop an enterprise-friendly version of Gentoo. Gentoo 
Enterprise would be extremely stable, with quarterly sets of release 
ebuilds guaranteed to persist for at least a year. There was then some 
discussion on whether to have a separate Gentoo Enterprise tree or to have 
a Portage keyword; Kurt will be writing a GLEP to tackle these and other 
issues soon. Once the floor was opened, developers brouhgt up several 
ideas. First, Brian Jackson[5] suggested "server metapackages" - these 
would be like the KDE and GNOME metapackages - "emerge vmail", for 
example, would create an already-configured virtual mail system. Next, 
more discussion about a separate tree for Gentoo Server, including ideas 
about using webrsync to get past paranoid corporate firewalls, using 
xdelta, and implementing a kickstart-like installation tool, took place.

Gentoo Linux BugDay on Saturday, February 7
-------------------------------------------
  
Once again it's the time of the month when users and developers gather on 
IRC and work together to hunt down as many bugs as possible. BugDay will 
be held next Saturday, February 7, in the #gentoo-bugs channel on 
irc.freenode.net. Good hunting! Contact Brian Jackson[6] if you have any 
questions.

GLSA: mod_python
----------------
  
Apache's mod_python module could crash the httpd process if a specific, 
malformed query string was sent. 
 
Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within 
the server allowing Python-based web-applications to be created. The 
Apache Foundation has reported that mod_python may be prone to Denial of 
Service attacks when handling a malformed query. Mod_python 2.7.9 was 
released to fix the vulnerability, however, because the vulnerability has 
not been fully fixed, version 2.7.10 has been released[7]. Users of 
mod_python 3.0.4 are not affected by this vulnerability. Although there 
are no known public exploits known for this exploit, users are recommended 
to upgrade mod_python to ensure the security of their infrastructure.

 * Severity: Low 
 * Packages Affected: <=dev-pithon/mod_python-2.7.9

 * GLSA Announcement[8]

GLSA: gaim
----------
  
Various overflows in the handling of AIM DirectIM packets was revealed in 
GAIM that could lead to a remote compromise of the IM client. 
 
Gaim is a multi-platform and multi-protocol instant messaging client. It 
is compatible with AIM , ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, 
Gadu-Gadu, and the Zephyr networks. Yahoo changed the authentication 
methods to their IM servers, rendering GAIM useless. The GAIM team 
released a rushed release solving this issue, however, at the same time a 
code audit[9] revealed 12 vulnerabilities. Due to the nature of instant 
messaging many of these bugs require man-in-the-middle attacks between the 
client and the server. But the underlying protocols are easy to implement 
and attacking ordinary TCP sessions is a fairly simple task. As a result, 
all users are advised to upgrade their GAIM installation.

Portaris Nearing Completion
 
On and off since December, stonent[11] has been working on getting Portage 
to run on Solaris, in order to provide a usable interface for updating an 
operating system quite different from Linux, much like Portage for Mac OS 
X[12]. Between him, developer Genone and a few other Solarists, it looks 
like they're making some real progress:

Germany: Linuxtag Preparations Under Way
 
Still three months to go before the actual event, but Gentoo's 
exhibitors-to-be at the next LinuxTag in Karlsruhe[21], Europe's biggest 
annual Open Source meeting, are already gathering their troops[22]. The 
LinuxTag is going to be held from 23 to 26 June this year, make room for 
that in your calenders. Coffee in the adjacent zoological garden 
(accessible from the venue) is known to be more than just decent, and 
Karlsruhe's quite pleasant setting and location almost on the French 
border is probably an excellent excuse for neighbouring country dwellers 
to come visit the German Gentooists...

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Improving DNS Lookups
 
This week's tip shows you how to improve DNS lookups by using multiple 
nameservers. This is useful if you've ever had your primary DNS server 
become unreachable for any reason.
 
Nameservers are listed in /etc/resolv.conf, one per line. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 7.1:                                                       |
| Example /etc/resolv.conf                                                |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|nameserver 192.168.1.1                                                   |
|nameserver 10.0.0.1                                                      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
To improve DNS lookups, add multiple DNS servers (preferably on different 
subnets) and the following options to /etc/resolv.conf:
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 7.2:                                                       |
| /etc/resolv.conf options                                                |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|options rotate                                                           |
|options timeout 1                                                        |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This will cause the resolver to rotate the DNS list after each query and 
to use a timeout of 1 second.
