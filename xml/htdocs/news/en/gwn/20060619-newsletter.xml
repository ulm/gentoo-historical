      <title>Userrel wants YOU! - User Representatives Nominations</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          As one of the major distributions at the moment, Gentoo's organisation
          can be a fiendishly complicated thing to understand, and it can be
          difficult to know how you can help out. To this end, we have created
          the position of ‘user representative’, and would like to take this
          opportunity to explain something about the role.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Know thy users” is popular advice, and often we attempt to achieve
          this by consultation with one or more users. People will tend to err
          towards the idea of the statistical ‘average user’ – one speaks for
          all. Although this approach is a simple and oftentimes effective way
          to find a representative user, the results are only valuable if the
          user base, their day-to-day tasks and work settings are homogeneous.
          If there are significant variations, this approach will fail to
          support some users, and can result in a product that does not meet
          their needs. It relies heavily upon having selected the most important
          user attributes for sampling and consultation, and can easily tempt us
          to think that knowing the characteristics of the average user, we need
          not consult with them. In this way it discourages us from challenging
          our own assumptions, and may deny us a source of valuable information
          that could prevent mistakes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The User Relations project focuses on bridging the gap between the
          developer and user communities, actively seeking out ways to improve
          communications between the two and encourage user involvement. It aims
          to ensure that high standards are met, and to work closely with other
          user focused projects to produce the best distribution possible for
          the user base. To this end, it is looking for user representatives to
          help in this quest.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The project has decided that 5 user representatives should be enough
          to provide a sufficiently diverse range of opinions and interests
          while avoiding the issues associated with having too many.
          Nominations are now open; see <uri
            link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-470136.html">this forum
            thread</uri> for more information and to nominate any users you
          would like to see considered for the position.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>What does a User Representative do?</b></p>
        
        <p>Becoming a user representative may take some time, energy and
          commitment, but it can also be very rewarding. The role of user
          representative involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Present the views, and represent the interests, of all elements of
            our diverse user base.</li>
          <li>Be a ‘critical friend’ to the User Relations project, offering
            alternative opinions and perspectives, and challenging the
            assumptions of all involved wherever appropriate.</li>
          <li>Engage positively with developers and Gentoo projects</li>
          <li>Interact with a wide range of groups and individuals to find out
            what our users think, and what they would like to see
            happening.</li>
          <li>Suggest ways in which other users could be engaged and involved in
            the project, in planning and delivering information and
            elsewhere.</li>
          <li>Channel information back to the users regarding proceedings of and
            decisions made in meetings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          If you were thinking of becoming a user representative, you
          will not be left alone. The user relations project will be there to
          support you, and you will be assigned a current developer as a point of
          contact with whom you can discuss any questions or concerns about your
          role or the group as a whole.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Why become a user representative?</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You will have the opportunity to influence how information, news,
            and support are delivered to users, and to ensure that they are
            organised in the best way possible for all our users.</li>
          <li>You will gain experience as an advocate for the user community,
            and useful knowledge and skills that can be applied in many areas of
            life.</li>
          <li>It is a great way to give something back to the community, and to
            get involved as a user.</li>
          <li>You will have the chance to meet and get to know other users and
            developers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>What makes a good user representative?</b></p>
        
        <p>The ideal user representative would:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be willing to network with a wide range of other users.</li>
          <li>Be seen as approachable by others, so that people will be open
            about their views. Be non-judgemental and show sensitivity towards
            what may be difficult issues.</li>
          <li>Work constructively with developers and staff. Not be scared or
            intimidated by developers, but to view them as people doing the best
            they can within constraints. Should it be necessary to challenge
            them, do so in a supportive manner wherever possible.</li>
          <li>Be able to negotiate, to make the case for a particular course of
            action, and willing to compromise where appropriate.</li>
          <li>Be able to step outside of his/her own experience, and be able to
            argue a viewpoint with which you may not fully agree.</li>
          <li>Present users' views with confidence, and not be afraid to raise
            issues about the role or the workings of the project.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Where can I learn more?</b></p>

      <title>Project Sunrise - Gentoo User Overlay</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Last week there was the announcement of an overlay for user-submitted
          ebuilds. This was intended to help users to find and use ebuilds that
          for now only exist in Gentoo Bugzilla and to ensure that these ebuilds
          adhere to quality standards. Also it might offer a good environment
          for recruiting new ebuild developers from the user community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving commit access to this repository to trusted users has caused
          some very intense debates, centering mostly around policies and
          potential problems from malicious users. During the council meeting on
          June 16th it was decided that while the idea is quite good the
          execution was lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a consequence the Sunrise overlay has been suspended from official
          Gentoo hardware, but it does continue on <uri
            link="http://gentoo-sunrise.org">gentoo-sunrise.org</uri> as an
          unofficial project. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunrise is looking for more users to add ebuilds from bugzilla to the
          overlay. You can find more information about Sunrise and its goals on
          <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/sunrise"> the project
            page</uri> and have a look at the <uri
            link="http://gentoo-sunrise.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/SunriseFaq">FAQ</uri>
          as well as the actual <uri
            link="http://gentoo-sunrise.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/browser">
            overlay.</uri> Feel free to visit the IRC channel - <uri

      <title>Java 1.5 progress and changes in Java handling</title> 
      <body>
        <p>
          As some might have noticed, Java 1.5 has been package.masked for
          some time now. There are a number of issues introduced with 1.5 that
          have kept it in package.mask. Please see <uri
            link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/java/tiger-faq.xml">the Java
            1.5 FAQ</uri> for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a year ago, work was begun on improving our part of the build
          system (read: Java related eclasses and our java-config tool) in a way
          to make it much more flexible in general, but specifically improve it to
          get around the known issues. It took about six months to fully develop.
          Unfortunately, the new system was not quite a drop-in replacement. So,
          it took from then until now to determine how to migrate from the current
          system  to the new one in a sane way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now we are ready to move to the new system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highlights of the new system:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to switch the current VM on the fly</li>
          <li>Changes to the user and system VM take effect immediately, and
            no longer are tied to the shell environment (ie no more running
            <c>env-update &amp;&amp; source /etc/profile</c> after switching
            the sytem VM)</li>
          <li>Now has the concept of a ‘build VM’, which is used to emerge
            packages, and is configured independently of the system VM.</li>
          <li>For each version of Java, ie 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, etc, the build vm
            can configured as to which vendor and version of a VM to use</li>
          <li>The VM at emerge time will be switched on the fly according to
            its configuration, as well as the dependency of the package. For
            example, some packages won't compile with 1.5. In these cases, a
            1.4 VM will be used at build time.</li>
          <li>Java packages which build with ant will have their build.xml
            rewritten at build time, in order to ensure that the correct
            version of Java bytecode is compiled.</li>
          <li>We'll be able to unmask Java 1.5 soon, and be able to handle
            Java 1.6 when it comes out this fall.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The new system is currently being <uri
            link="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/39547">discussed
            on the gentoo-dev mailinglist</uri>, and assuming no major issues
          come up, will likely make their way into the tree in the next few
          weeks.

      <title>nss_ldap breakage and how to prevent it</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          With the upgrade to nss_ldap-249 and later many users found their
          system in an almost unusable state: Upon boot it could take an
          extremely long time (up to an hour) to get to a login prompt. This is
          caused by a small change in behaviour: What used to be a fixed timeout
          is now a configurable amount of attempts with increasing time between
          them. Information how to fix this problem can be found here:

        <p><b>Defining the Tree: a proto-GLEP.</b></p>
        <p>
          <mail link="spb@gentoo.org">Stephen Bennett</mail> starts a discussion
          that has its roots in the “alternative package manager” threads of the
          last weeks. One issue that was often mentioned is the lack of a formal
          specification of the ebuild format, environment and many other small
          details. So Stephen intends to write, together with the portage team
          and other interested developers, a full specification if there is

          is set to be implemented at some point after the 2006.1 release.

          GLEP 42, “Critical News Reporting”, has been waiting in a sort of

          Bennett has now taken over sponsorship of it, and sent it to the

          and should be sent to the Gentoo Council for approval in the near
          future.

      <title>Rapid GUI Development with QtRuby</title>
          <body>
          <p>
            Gentoo Developer <mail link="caleb@gentoo.org">Caleb Tennis</mail>
            has recently published a book called “Rapid GUI Development with
            QtRuby”. It is available as PDF on the <uri
              link="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ctrubyqt/index.html">Pragmatic
              Programmer Website</uri>. While it does assume some basic working
            knowledge of Ruby it is intended to be easy to read and informative
            even for people not yet familiar with Qt. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is not Gentoo-specific all testing of programs for this
            book happened on Gentoo. The QtRuby bindings can be emerged with
            <c>emerge qtruby</c>, the KDE extension Korundum can also be emerged
            with <c>emerge korundum</c>, so Gentoo users will have it especially
            easy if they wish to play around with these programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Caleb Tennis has been a Gentoo developer for three years now and is
            part of the Ruby, Qt and KDE herds.

        <title>Exploring portage features</title>
        <body>
          <p>
            The new release of Portage 2.1 brings many features and
            improvements.  While most of them are documented in the example
            make.conf and the portage man page they may not be obvious to most
            users, so we will show how to use some of these features.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the features have to be set in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Portage is now able to download some package's source code while
            compiling another. This can considerably reduce installation time
            when emerging many packages. There's no need to run <c>emerge
              --fetchonly</c> while doing a normal emerge anymore.  You just
            have to add the following option:
          </p>
          <pre caption="Setting parallel-fetch in /etc/make.conf">
FEATURES="parallel-fetch"
          </pre>
          <p>
            This feature appears to be non-functional in some of the Portage 2.1
            releases, but is expected to be fixed soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another new option to reduce installation time yet a bit more is
            confcache.  With this new feature portage caches many of the tests
            configuration scripts do, thus making execution faster.  This comes
            with the small risk of caching wrong values, so be warned that this
            feature is known to have a few bugs.  Since this package is
            currently keyworded on most architectures, the required steps to
            enable it are:
          </p>
          <pre caption="Enabling confcache">
<comment>Add this in /etc/make.conf</comment>
FEATURES="confcache"
<comment>We need to unmask the package before emerging it</comment>
echo "=dev-util/confcache-0.4.2-r1 ~arch" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.keywords
<comment>Installing confcache</comment>
emerge -av confcache
<comment>On further installations. you'll see stuff like:</comment>
checking for i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc... (cached) i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc
checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler...(cached) yes
checking whether i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc accepts -g... (cached) yes
        </pre>
        <p>
          Another important new feature is the ability to log all the messages
          ebuilds print. Which messages to log and how to do it is configurable.
          For example, to save just the warnings and errors in a separate file
          for each package we emerge, you have to add:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Configuring logging features in /etc/make.conf">
<comment>This sets what to log</comment>
PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="warn error log"
<comment>And this is how to do it</comment>
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"
        </pre>
        <p>
          There are many more options like sending log messages via email.
          Please check out make.conf.example for further information.
