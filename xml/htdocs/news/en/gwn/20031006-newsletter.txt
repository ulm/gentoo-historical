Gentoo Linux Performance Metrics
--------------------------------
  
On 23 Sep 2003, Jose Alberto Suarez Lopez gave a presentation[1] at 
HispaLinux 2003[2] where he demonstrated the load-time performance of the 
official Gentoo Linux 1.4 release. Gentoo Linux 1.4 for Pentium III, with 
and without prelink, were compared with a default Mandrake 9.1 
installation on a Pentium III. The results - Gentoo Linux 1.4 with prelink 
did better than Mandrake 9.1 across the board, and even without prelinking 
Mozilla loaded nearly twice as quickly in Gentoo, and NetBeans loaded more 
than twice as fast.

The conclusions we can glean from this are that the default optimizations 
in Gentoo Linux for Pentium III make a significant difference in in "real 
world" application load-time performance. Also, prelinking seems to 
greatly improve the load time of KDE apps. Gentoo Linux is able to 
generally deliver better overall performance than other Linux 
distributions because we try to offer the latest and best free software 
technologies to our users, like the latest compiler toolchains, and 
because we ship pre-built binary packages that have been optimized for 
specific CPU models (and also provide an easy way for users to "build 
Gentoo from scratch." For more information, read the rest of the 
findings[3]. To pick up your own optimized build or release of Gentoo, 
visit the Gentoo Store[4].

GLSA: openssl
-------------
  
Quote from OpenSSL advisory:
 
"1. Certain ASN.1 encodings that are rejected as invalid by the parser can 
trigger a bug in the deallocation of the corresponding data structure, 
corrupting the stack. This can be used as a denial of service attack. It 
is currently unknown whether this can be exploited to run malicious code. 
This issue does not affect OpenSSL 0.9.6.
 
2. Unusual ASN.1 tag values can cause an out of bounds read under certain 
circumstances, resulting in a denial of service vulnerability.
 
3. A malformed public key in a certificate will crash the verify code if 
it is set to ignore public key decoding errors. Public key decode errors 
are not normally ignored, except for debugging purposes, so this is 
unlikely to affect production code. Exploitation of an affected 
application would result in a denial of service vulnerability.
 
4. Due to an error in the SSL/TLS protocol handling, a server will parse a 
client certificate when one is not specifically requested. This by itself 
is not strictly speaking a vulnerability but it does mean that *all* 
SSL/TLS servers that use OpenSSL can be attacked using vulnerabilities 1, 
2 and 3 even if they don't enable client authentication."
 
 * Severity: Medium - remote exploit 
 * Packages Affected: <0.9.6k 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge openssl; emerge clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[9]

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Thomas Raschbacher
 
Figure 3.1: Thomas Raschbacher
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20031006_lordvan.jpg
 
This week, we are featuring Thomas Raschbacher[11] (LordVan), the head of 
Gentoo's printing team and frequent contributer of fixes and ebuilds for 
python and DVB. He also serves on the German translation team, including 
managing the translation of our beloved GWN. He primarily works on 
developing new ebuilds and patching old ones. In addition to his work with 
Gentoo, Thomas has provided translation for the Gnome project and patch 
work for Twisted[12], as well as some work on smaller projects. He is 
quite proud of some of the web development work he has completed using 
Twisted, and plans to open source it.

Thomas is a relatively old hand at Linux, having started with Slackware in 
1996. He moved to Gentoo almost immediately on hearing of the project in 
August of 2002. Thomas became a developer for the distro in December of 
that year, after (as he says) "being too annoying about my ebuilds and 
fixes getting submitted" to Seemant Kulleen[13]. Thomas describes Gentoo 
as a "damn nice distro that I wish I could do more for". 

 13. seemant@gentoo.org
 
Thomas lives in Judenau-Baumgarten, Lower Austria. He has completed 
Technical Informatics studies at Higher Technical School as well as his 
Matura (equivalent to A-Levels or Matriculation). He is self-employed in 
computer sales consulting, including web design and Linux support. He is 
an avid martial artist, currently studying Ninjutsu[14] (as well as 
studying Japanese). He also enjoys traditional geek fare of Star Trek, 
Anime and Manga. In that vein, the favorite quote he shared is from the 
Anime classic End of Evangelion (a conversation between the characters 
Shinji and Rei): "Then... where is my dream? It is the continuation of 
reality. Where is... my reality? It is at the end of your dream.". 
Finally, Thomas is active in organizing and attending LAN parties.[15]

Thomas does most of his work on a Celeron server, development workstation 
and a production web server. In addition, he has a laptop, a Zaurus 
handheld, and an assortment of test stations and servers. His primary 
development tools include python, sed and grep. He communicates using 
mutt, MozillaFirebird, Xchat-2 and MozillaThunderbird. He is also fond of 
gnotime, a fully-featured time tracker. Like many of us, his first task on 
waking it to check his email.

Latter Days PHP
 
Back in the days of just a few thousand Forum users it used to be 
excessive trigger-happiness whenever triplets or even more counts of the 
same post appeared in the Forums. But these days the reason for repetitive 
postings (vulgo: postorrhea) were sluggish to non-forthcoming responses 
from the database whenever someone hit the submit button under heavy 
traffic conditions, and yes, multiple posts can indeed occur even if the 
submit button is hit only once. While the moderators of the German forum, 
to alleviate the burden a little, have actually started asking people to 
point out useless, duplicate, very old and unresponded threads that may be 
deleted without anyone missing them, the hardly bearable performance 
issues have led site admin klieber[16] to kick off an open discussion 
about possible alternatives to the current forum software, phpBB, 
soliciting opinions about commercial packages as a potential replacement:

Portage on the Web
 
With stable.gentoo.org being shelved for the time being, and the package 
database on the main Gentoo website[19] somewhat tightlipped when it comes 
to comments and status overviews for packages, thrasher6670[20] had the 
idea to set up a semi-automated, yet interactive site[21] keeping track of 
the content of the Portage tree and offering possibilities to add user 
impressions for each package. From what he says himself in the thread he 
started (repeated on site), thrasher6670 could use some help with the web 
design...

Lightweight FileManagers for Gentoo 
 
Many users were attracted to Gentoo because it offered a lightweight, 
"only what you want" type solution for their needs. Likewise some users 
enjoy the same kind of desktop. Take a look at  this thread [27] for a few 
suggestions of some.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Using qpkg
 
This week's tip demonstrates some basic uses of the "query package" (qpkg) 
which allows you to perform get information about installed or uninstalled 
packages on your system. It can be used to find package ownership of 
files, to find duplicate packages, to list the files installed by a 
package, and more. 
 
To get qpkg you need to install app-portage/gentoolkit. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.1:                                                       |
| Installing gentoolkit                                                   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# emerge app-portage/gentoolkit                                          |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now that you have qpkg installed, you can start using it to examine your 
system. The first example is figuring out which package owns which file. 
This is done with the --find-file (or alternatively --find-pattern option. 
 
Note:  To get a complete list of packages and the version installed on 
your machine use the command qpkg --installed --verbose. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.2:                                                       |
|Finding the package that owns a fil                                      |

|                                                                         |
|Which package owns /etc/crontab?                                         |
|% qpkg --find-file /etc/crontab                                          |
|sys-apps/vcron *                                                         |
|                                                                         |
|What version of vcron? (--verbose)                                       |
|% qpkg --find-file --verbose /etc/crontab                                |
|sys-apps/vcron-3.0.1-r1 *                                                |
|                                                                         |
|Where's the ebuild for this file? (--verbose --verbose)                  |
|% qpkg --find-file --verbose --verbose /etc/crontab                      |
|   /var/db/pkg/sys-apps/vcron-3.0.1-r1/vcron-3.0.1-r1.ebuild             |
|sys-apps/vcron-3.0.1-r1 *                                                |

To list all the files a package installed, use the --list option.

The last example shows you how to find which packages depend on a 
specified package using --query-deps. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Finding dependencies                                                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|% qpkg --installed --query-deps mozilla                                  |
|net-www/mozilla-1.4-r3 *                                                 |
|DEPENDED ON BY:                                                          |
|        net-mail/evolution-1.4.3                                         |
|        net-www/galeon-1.3.9                                             |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Note:  Not specifying --installed causes qpkg to look inside the entire 
Portage tree which is probably not what you want. 
 
This should get you started with qpkg. For more options see qpkg --help or 
man 1 qpkg.
