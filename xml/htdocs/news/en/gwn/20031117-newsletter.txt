Gentoo Weekly Newsletter
http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/current.xml
This is the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter for the week of November 17th, 2003.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gentoo News

Summary
-------
  
 * packages.gentoo.org now live 
 * Porting "sandbox" to BSD libc 
    
packages.gentoo.org now live
----------------------------
  
We're proud to announce that packages.gentoo.org[1] is now up, replacing 
the old online package database with a new one featuring many 
improvements: 

 1. http://packages.gentoo.org
 
 * a searchable interface 
 * a chronology of new packages 
 * more information about each package, including the most recent 
changelog entries 
 * an easy way to tell which packages are masked on various architectures 
    
Porting "sandbox" to BSD libc
-----------------------------
  
The Gentoo-BSD subproject is seeking an individual who would be interested 
in porting Portage's sandbox code so that it works on the *BSDs as well as 
on linux. In principle this task should be fairly straightforward, as one 
just needs to replace the linux-specific system calls with their *BSD 
equivalents--anybody who has ever had a course using W. Richard Stevens' 
classic "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" text (or a more 
modern equivalent) would be more than qualified. Moreover, a successful 
port would also use GNU autotools to identify the requisite system calls 
using the normal "configure" script. Anybody interested should e-mail his 
or her intent and qualifications to Grant Goodyear[2].

2. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Luke-Jr
 
This week's featured developer is somewhat more mysterious than most, 
having declined to provide either a photograph or an IRS-compatible name. 
We even have to guess at a pronoun, but the fact that Luke-Jr[3] is a 
Computer Science student at Tunxis Community College[4] indicates that it 
is likely he is a resident of Connecticut in the U.S. In Gentoo's virtual 
community, Luke-Jr works to bring "Gentoo to every computer user" by 
working on tools like a newbie-friendly graphical installer. He may also 
end up taking over KPortage[5], unless some other willing soul appears. He 
is currently working on developing BitTorrent[6] based tools for 
distributing things like LiveCDs and stages.

 5. http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/kportage/
 6. http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/
 
Luke-Jr has been using Linux since Red Hat 5.2 and later switched to a 
packageless manual compile system. He moved to Gentoo over a year ago when 
he began to feel the pain of keeping his system up-to-date. After spending 
some considerable time at the Gentoo booth at LinuxWorld Expo in January 
of 2003, he began to consider forking Gentoo to create a more 
newbie-friendly version. Upon discovering that the existing Gentoo 
developers had no objection to adding those tools to the existing distro, 
he began working as a Gentoo developer. 
 
Luke-Jr has a fair bit of experience in Open Source development. He was a 
primary developer on the Open Direct Connect[7] file sharing program as 
well as working on the Kye[8] puzzle game (which he plans to port to QT), 
MOO extensions and Tasogare[9], a multiplayer online RPG engine. He was 
particularly pleased with $phone, a MOO extension that allowed users to 
call virtual phone numbers on other MOOs, and the accomplishment of 
rewriting the Kye engine. Nevertheless, he considers Gentoo his "primary 
job", describing it as "the best operating system that currently exists".

Luke-Jr is a KDE[10] user, largely because of the window manager, 
Konqueror, Kontact, Konsole and the Kicker (although he would consider 
dropping the last if someone would port the OSX taskbar). His favorite 
applications include Qt Designer[11], Mozilla Composer[12] and Psi[13].

 13. http://psi.affinix.com
 
Luke-Jr's favorite quote comes is one of Richard Stallman's comments on 
proprietary software: "It was useless for a community." In that vein, he 
made a plea for people to shift away from obsolete or closed IM protocols 
toward the open and standardized Jabber/XMPP. He also points out that he 
has made the  hex time [14] display from his  screenshot[15] available 
with emerge khexclock.

Moving /usr/portage 
 
Eventually, everyone seems to run low on disk space. One Gentoo list 
member was curious if it was possible to move /usr/portage to some place 
else to free some up. The short answer is "yes"; the question resulted in 
a cool thread with many useful `mount' tricks. Read  on [17] here.

Gentoo Documentation.
 
Now, like so many other things about gentoo, the Gentoo Documentation 
Project (GDP) has a home page[18]. Have a look here[19] for the details 
about the project..

Losing Ebuilds (a.k.a. the joys of openssl-0.9.7!)
 
Have a look at this[20] problem around old computers doing security 
updates, and running into trouble when the older ebuilds for a certain 
package have been deleted from the tree as older versions.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Using the file command
 
This week's tip demonstrates the use of the file command. This command has 
been in UNIX since at least 1973 but is often overlooked. However, it's an 
extremely useful command for classifying files. 
 
The file command is provided by the package sys-apps/file, so if you don't 
already have it installed, you'll need to type emerge file. Chances are 
you've already got it on your system though. To use file simply type file 
filename and you'll see information about the filename you passed in. 
Simple right?
