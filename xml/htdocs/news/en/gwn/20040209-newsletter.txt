Gentoo Linux Project seeking an additional dialup developer
-----------------------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Linux Project is looking for a developer to join the net-dialup 
team to help quash bugs and maintain ebuilds. We're looking for dedicated 
devolpers, preferably with experience in developing for dialup packages 
and writing ebuilds. If you're not sure you have what it takes, check out 
this[1] bug list. If you're still interested, send an email to Heinrich 
Wendel[2] with some background info.

New gentoo-science mailing list
-------------------------------
  
Gentoo User Andrew Fant[3] is currently in the process of pulling together 
a group interested in the use of Gentoo technology in computational 
science and engineering. To this end, a mailing list 
(gentoo-science@gentoo.org; follow the instructions on the mailing list 
page[4] to subscribe) and IRC channel (gentoo-science on irc.freenode.net) 
have been established. The initial focus will be on providing a clearing 
house for applying Gentoo Linux to scientific computing, as well as 
working with the maintainers of the science herd to help speed the 
unmasking of new versions of applications. In the longer term, they hope 
to engage in advocacy and voicing the needs of end-users interested in 
scientific computing.

Our featured developer for this week is Bryan Stine[5] (battousai), a 
recent addition to the development team who is working with Donnie 
Berkholz[6] and the xfree herd[7] on improving ati-gatos[8] support in 
portage, as well as helping with the Hardened Gentoo[9] project 
maintaining the Bastille-Linux[10] and PSAD[11] projects. His main tasks 
at this early point in his dev career comprise developing, updating and 
testing ebuilds, as well as the perennial tasks of bug identification and 
squashing - whether in ebuilds or the original applications. Bryan has 
also been working with the xfree herd in adapting the XFree86 SDK to 
assist with the task of simplifying XFree installations under Gentoo.

Bryan has been using Linux for about seven years, having worked with it 
under the RedHat, Slackware and Mandrake distros - with Mandrake as his 
preference prior to encountering Gentoo. He first encountered Gentoo when 
version 1.0 was in pre-release, and welcomed it as an opportunity to 
escape RPM package management. His role on the development team began when 
Seemant Kulleen[12] asked him to assist with some perl hacking in order to 
get Bastille-Linux working with Gentoo. After taking over maintenance of 
the Bastille-Linux and PSAD (a log analyzer and intrusion detector) 
ebuilds as a user, Bryan was asked to take on formal responsibilities as a 
Gentoo developer. He commented that "I really enjoyed contributing as a 
user, and that enjoyment continues as I am now a developer", and remarked 
on the continuing friendliness and helpfulness of users and developers as 
he has settled in. In addition to his new role, Bryan still enjoys helping 
out with user questions on the #gentoo IRC channel, and is frequently seen 
there under his pseudonym, Battousai.

Bryan is "a long-time KDE user", who counts KvIRC[13] and Kontact[14] and 
slicKer[15] among his favorite apps. He is also fond of Konqueror[16] and 
Mozilla Firebird[17]. He works on an Athlon XP 2800+ (512 MB, 120 GB SATA, 
Radeon 7200) workstation and an HP laptop from WalMart that sports an 
Athlon XP 2200+ M (256 MB, 30 GB).

Bryan is currently a sophomore student, studying Computer Science at East 
Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania in the United States. He lives in a 
small town north of Philadelphia, near New York city. He is an avid hockey 
fan, unfailingly cheering for the Philadelphia Flyers. He is also a video 
(not computer) game aficionado, anime watcher and unapologetic Groening 
fan. Bryan closed our interview with a favorite quote from Futurama's 
robotic alchoholic, Bender: "Arrr...the law of science be a harsh 
mistress.", and a reminder to mark our calendars with September 19th, 
"International Talk-Like-a-Pirate Day".

3. User Story
=============
  
Michael Rayment, MUN: Computer Department at University of Newfoundland 
Switches to Gentoo
 
Michael Rayment, the system administrator at Canada's Memorial University 
of Newfoundland[18] who decided to put Gentoo on every single desktop and 
server in the house, sent us an account of his motivations for moving to 
Gentoo that was so convincing we decided to publish it verbatim:

 18. http://www.cs.mun.ca
 
Background
 
First I should provide a little background. I work as a system 
administrator at a moderate sized university providing computing support 
for the student computer labs across campus. In total my group provides 
support for about 800 client workstations some of which are part of a 
Beowulf cluster, others are Linux only and some are dual boot 
(Linux/Win98). One common feature is that they are all booting Linux 
disklessly using an internal boot prom (PXE or Etherboot). All the client 
workstations get their Linux software from one of 15 application servers 
that each have identical copies of the Linux software. Only the kernels 
are customized to run on their respective hardware. The lowest end 
computers are AMD 266's but most of the computers are in the 600 to 2800 
megahertz range. It is quite remarkable that such a wide range of 
computers can run from a single image but what a difference it makes to 
managing those systems. Within minutes we can rsync the latest 
modifications out to our 15 application servers and immediately the 
software is available to our 800 clients. Over the years we have based our 
image on Slackware, Debian, Mandrake and Redhat.
 
Making the Plunge
 
Until quite recently we were running Redhat 7.2 heavily modified and 
patched to keep up-to-date with the latest security patches and some newer 
versions of applications. You might wonder why we are still running Redhat 
7.2 instead of the latest and greatest. Well the reason is that invariably 
things break and packages are missing or don't work after a major upgrade. 
In short the users get upset and therefore we take a lot of time checking 
the new distribution before inflicting it on our users. Also we have to 
munge the distribution to get it to play well in the diskless environment. 
Putting out a new distribution is therefore something that we don't take 
lightly and don't do at the drop of the hat. However the applications and 
libraries are getting old and are in need of a refresh so we began looking 
at alternatives last summer.
 
Our first task was to come up with a list of what we wanted from our new 
distribution. At the top of our wish list was a distribution that:
 
 * would evolve gradually over time and not go though completely "new" 
distributions every year. 
 * would be comprehensive so that we would not have to go out to other 
sources and get missing applications and deal with inevitable 
incompatibilities. 
 * would be able to gracefully deal with package dependencies so we don't 
have to hunt around on the net for particular packages that are required 
to get an application going. 
 * would be highly configurable and allow for the easy customization of 
software to fit into our environment. 
 * would provide access to the source code actually running on our 
systems. 
 * would play well in a diskless environment. 
 
At the end of the day Gentoo won out on all counts. Gentoo provides an 
incredible utility called emerge that is able to keep our image up-to-date 
without inflicting our user community with traumatic change. Changes in 
one package here or there, following an emerge -u world, is much easier to 
handle and test than the installation of a completely new distribution. We 
were amazed at the 6000 odd packages (I didn't bother to count) that are 
supported under the Gentoo distribution. Most of the software that we have 
accumulated over the years was available through a simple emerge command. 
I really enjoyed the way Gentoo dealt with software dependencies. Under 
our Redhat distribution sometimes we would have to hunt down packages in 
order to get an application up and running. With Gentoo it lists the 
dependencies and, at the installers request, proceeds to download, compile 
and install all the dependencies along with the application. Another 
feature of Gentoo is that it is a source distribution and so all the 
sources are readily available in a compact form that can be easily be 
expanded and viewed for debugging purposes. Since the conversion of 
sources to binary is accomplished through the use of ebuild scripts, it is 
possible to control the way your system compiles and where the various 
package components are installed.
 
Finally and most importantly I was pleased that Gentoo played well with 
our diskless environment. One thing that made converting to a diskless 
environment easy was the ability to have named run levels. This allows us 
to start up computers running different services by passing an argument to 
the kernel at boot time. For each of our specialized environments (eg. 
dual boot computers, single boot computers, Beowulf systems, firewalls, 
dial up ISP computers and kiosk computers), the symlinks to the specific 
start up scripts are simply placed into an appropriately named directory 
and the diskless client then takes on the requested functions based on the 
boot up parameter. Another thing I liked was the way that you could fake 
the start up of a particular component of the run time start up sequence. 
This is important when booting disklessly as things like the network 
services are already configured before init even starts.
 
Where We Are
 
We have just started the roll out of Gentoo into our lab environment. We 
are currently running a modified Gentoo image on a few computers in one of 
our Computer Science labs and will turn more on as we work out the 
wrinkles. We will soon be starting to build our master Gentoo server that 
will sync out software to the application servers. As we switch one lab 
from Redhat to Gentoo we will simply point the labs application server to 
the Gentoo master sync server. It will probably take a month or two to 
complete the switch over depending on how busy we are and how many 
problems we run into. Again we like to make sure things are working well 
before inflicting change on our users.
 
Comments
 
As to whether Gentoo is the distribution for you, well that depends on a 
number of things. As you can well imagine we have a lot of experience with 
Unix and Linux and we also like to do unusual things with our computers. 
Gentoo is ideal for this kind of situation. The portage system does make 
things very smooth so I can certainly see neophytes being able to install 
a Gentoo system without much effort but for the guy who just wants to turn 
on the computer and have it work then I can see a real advantage in the 
traditional binary distribution. One of the big advantages of Linux is 
that there are multiple ways to set up your computer. Hopefully there will 
be a way, whether it be Redhat or Gentoo, that meets everyones needs so 
that some day most people will actually choose Linux over Microsoft when 
selecting an OS.
 
My other hope is that there will be greater support for running Linux in a 
diskless environment. What is needed is a standard way of doing Linux 
disklessly so that software developers can write their software in such a 
way as to facilitate the running of their applications in a diskless 
environment. The /dev file system and /dev/shm have certainly gone a long 
way towards facilitating the diskless transition. The adoption of the /var 
as the directory of choice for applications to write to, has made the task 
quite easy but occasionally some applications still do something that 
messes up. But from a systems management point of view going diskless is 
worth the effort. It offers truly distributed computing with truly 
centralized management control and it is something that Microsoft does not 
offer. It is therefore something that the Linux world should promote.

4. Gentoo Security
==================
   
GLSA: mod_php
-------------
  
PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially 
suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. If the server 
configuration "php.ini" file has "register_globals = on" and a request is 
made to one virtual host (which has "php_admin_flag register_globals off") 
and the next request is sent to the another virtual host (which does not 
have the setting) through the same apache child, the setting will persist. 
This may lead to leaks of global variables. 
 
Depending on the server and site, an attacker may be able to exploit 
global variables to gain access to reserved areas, such as MySQL 
passwords, or this vulnerability may simply cause a lack of functionality. 
As a result, users are urged to upgrade their PHP installations. Gentoo 
ships PHP with "register_globals" set to "off" by default. This issue 
affects both servers running Apache 1.x and servers running Apache 2.x. 
 
 * Severity: Normal 
 * Packages Affected: <=dev-php/mod_php-4.3.4-r3 
 * Retification: emerge sync; emerge -pv ">=dev-php/mod_php-4.3.4-r4"; 
emerge ">=dev-php/mod_php-4.3.4-r4" 
 * GLSA Announcement[19]

Indian Languages in Gentoo
 
Aniruddha Shankar akaKream[20] isn't exactly new to the Forums, in fact, 
he's been one of its first users, mere days after forums.gentoo.org's 
initial setup in April 2002. Despite this early involvement, he's only had 
very little over a dozen posts - and as it turns out just this weekend, 
that's to be seen as a clear victory for quality over quantity: His 
modified scripts for enabling Indian language support are in the 
Documentation, Tips & Tricks section now, a must-have for Indian Gentoo 
users. Original author Guntupalli Karunakar's IndLinux[21] scripts, font 
and tool packages aim at providing Panjabi, Tamil and other languages to 
the Linux desktop, too, but for the time being Hindi is the only language 
supported, and it only works in a limited number of desktop environments.

Libraries and Binary Packages.
 
Use many binary packages? Ever have trouble with broken library links? 
Well, this is the post for you. Enter the world of binary packages in 
Gentoo. More often than not, we compile here in Gentoo land, but sometimes 
(kde, gnome, openoffice please take the stage) it's just as easy to use 
pre-compiled packages. However, this can provide it's own fun adventures 
when it comes to library dependancies. Have a look[28] for more ideas.

One of our favorite accessories, etc-update, usually makes life a whole

system specific - configuration files like /etc/fstab, /etc/group and 
/etc/passwd? Should etc-update leave those alone regardless? Should the 
default be to make "example" files of the new files? Check it out[29].

Just like last year, lots of Europeans on the Gentoo team take the 
opportunity to be at Europe's number one developer conference[30] quite 
seriously. This is the best venue for a meeting of those who are actively 
participating in advancing Gentoo Linux on a planetary scale, and besides 
Brussels does have a rather interesting gastronomical infrastructure, too. 
Though it's mostly a conference and not an exhibition as such, there will 
be an even bigger and better Gentoo booth than last year. If you want to 
make sure you meet the right people, be there on both Saturday 21 and

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Job Control
 
This week's tip shows you how to use the basics of job control in the 
shell by putting processes in the background and returning them to the 
foreground. 
 
Whenever you execute a command at the command line, that's a job that has 
to be run. Most commands execute quickly and return you to the command 
line. But some commands (for example, using cp to copy a large amount of 
data), can take a long time. When that happens, your terminal will be 
unaccessible unless you put the job in the background. 
 
To put a job in the background, type <Ctrl>-z to suspend the job (and 
regain control of your terminal), and then type bg to put the job in the 
background.
