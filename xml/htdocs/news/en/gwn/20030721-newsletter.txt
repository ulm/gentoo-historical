Open positions in the Gentoo Linux project
------------------------------------------
  
Gentoo Infrastructure team
 
The Gentoo Infrastructure team is currently seeking volunteers for the 
following positions: 
 
 * qmail/ezmlm-idx administrator This person should be well-versed in 
qmail administration and ideally, also well-versed in emzlm-idx 
administration. This position does not require large amounts of time, but 
it does require consistent small chunks of time throughout a typical week. 
Volunteers should expect to spend 10-20 minutes every day or 20-30 minutes 
every 2-3 days handling various mail administration tasks. 
 * cfengine architect/administrator This person should be well-versed in 
implementing and administering cfengine[3], a high-level policy language 
and tool used for system administration.  
 3. http://www.cfengine.org

If you're interested in one of these positions, please send an email to 
Kurt Lieber[4].

OpenAFS
 
The Gentoo Linux project is looking for developers to maintain the OpenAFS 
package. Please email recruiters@gentoo.org if you are interested.
    
Introducing the Gentoo Server project
-------------------------------------
  
This week we'd like to introduce the Gentoo Server project, a community 
effort started by users who felt the need for a solid documentation base 
for the use and administration of Gentoo Linux in a production 
environment. Their new Wiki[5] already contains much useful information 
contributed by regulars of the gentoo-sysadmin@gentoo.org mailing list and 
#gentoo-server IRC channel on irc.freenode.net, but is looking for more 
contributors to help it become the one-stop guide for serving with Gentoo 
that it aims to be. Definitely a great place to go to if you have a 
server-related question, or if you've just experienced a networking 
epiphany you'd like to share with your fellow Gentoomen.

Bytemark Hosting begins offering Gentoo Linux
---------------------------------------------
  
Bytemark Hosting[6], a provider of UML(User-Mode Linux[7])-based virtual 
hosting solutions, has now begun offering Gentoo Linux as a distribution 
option for new and existing users. They've also donated a 256MB host to 
the Gentoo project, which is now hosting a European mirror of the main web 
site, and are continuing to offer a 10% discount to authors of open source 
software.

=================================
  
Kurt Lieber
 
Figure 4.1: Kurt Lieber
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20030721_klieber.jpg
 
This week, we're particularly pleased to feature Kurt Lieber. Kurt 
recently handed over responsibility for the Gentoo Weekly News, for which 
he served as inaugural editor, initiating the project with a post[11] to 
the forums. The GWN has grown into one of the most popular and useful 
resources for the Gentoo community, thanks largely to Kurt's initial 
vision. 

 11. http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=25113
 
Kurt began working with Gentoo by serving as moderator of the nascent 
forums. His effectiveness there prompted the role to grow into 
responsibility for Gentoo's infrastructure. Kurt and his team work 
tirelessly (and, too often, thanklessly) at maintaining the network of 
servers and mirrors that such a download-intensive distro as Gentoo 
requires to be successful. This accomplishment is a source of pride for 
Kurt. In his own words, "I'm proud of the team that we've slowly put 
together to work on infrastructure issues. It's still a work in progress, 
but we have a team of motivated, committed professionals who do an 
outstanding job of making me look good." The accomplishment is even more 
notable if we recall that there is no budget for infrastructure and that 
the team needs to somehow maintain an enterprise-class system using 
donated computers and hand-me-down equipment. 
 
In June, Kurt was amongst those named to form Gentoo's new management 
structure[12]. Kurt will be one of six top-level managers, taking 
responsibility for strategic management of portage and Gentoo's Public 
Relations efforts, as well as his continuing role in managing Gentoo 
infrastructure. Kurt will also serve as a backup for developer relations 
management. Kurt took the time to comment on the new management structure 
for us: 

 12. http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/management-structure.xml
 
"My personal goal and one that I think I share with the rest of the team, 
is finding the minimum level of management required to effectively run 
this project. I'm not a big fan of complex structures, overly-burdensome 
rules and yards and yards of red tape. That said, I do appreciate and 
recognize that some amount of structure is needed to effectively steer a 
project of our size." 
 
Although he has contributed bug fixes to several OSS projects, Gentoo was 
Kurt's first formal role on a significant project. His favorite 
applications reflect his background as a system administrator: screen, 
irssi, cfengine and nagios. He uses KDE for his Window Manager and the 
venerable mutt for mail. An ironic twist to his sense of humor is 
displayed in the favorite quote he offered us: 
 
 * Linux System Administration Rule #1: "There is always more than one way 
to accomplish the same task." 
 * Corollary to Rule #1: "Someone always thinks that your way is wrong." 
 
Kurt lives in New York City, working for a Fortune 500 financial 
institution. He likes to tinker with old cars and takes special pleasure 
in his restored 1972 GMC Suburban.

1.4 Release at LinuxWorld
 
Releases don't play a very important role in the Gentoo concept, but some 
features are related to distinct version numbers, most importantly the 
Gentoo Reference Platform (GRP) packages and the LiveCD. Plus everybody 
outside the realm of Gentoo Linux keeps ogling the numbers, anyway, and 
therefore need to be reminded of progress by bumping numerological 
evidence. Gentoo users have greeted the announcement of Gentoo 1.4 to be 
released in time for LinuxWorld in San Francisco on 5 August with a debate 
in the Forums, candied with a few completely irrelevant, albeit funny 
remarks about the thermodynamics of hell: 
 * Gentoo 1.4 @ LinuxWorld Expo[13] 
 * Gentoo 1.4 kommt 5. - 7. August raus :)[14] (in German)

When USE Flags Don't Work 
 
Many of us who run Gentoo on our headless servers utilize Gentoo's USE 
flags to tell Portage not to install anything graphical in nature on them. 
Loopingz, a command-line PHP user was curious why even with a "-qt" USE 
flag, PHP was still requiring QT. Robin Johnson, the PHP ebuild maintainer 
got involved and explained it all out for everyone. Link here[15].

Becoming more involved with Gentoo's development
 
Looking to contribute back or get more involved with the Gentoo project? 
User sdesseaux was. While looking for ways to contribute, he noticed how 
Gentoo's install procedure can be long and winding for those fairly new to 
Linux. He proposed a project to create a graphical installer and looked 
for feedback on such a project. Quickly, other users presented similar 
projects, such as the Gentoo Linux Install Script[16] Project and a tool 
called InGen, which is provided on Gentoo's CVS server under 
gentoo/users/luke-jr/ingen/. Link here[17].

NYFIX Goes Gentoo on the Desktop!
 
Aberdeen Group[19], a Boston-based technology consultant and market 
analysis firm, reported last week that an electronic stock trading system 
provider, NYFIX[20], has started transitioning their systems from Windows 
to Linux, for reasons quite understandable in their business: According to 
Aberdeen consultant Bill Claybrook, they were just tired of the downtime 
involved in applying patches to Windows systems... Now servers that used 
to run Windows or Solaris will be based on more conservative Linux 
distributions, but the desktops for traders will run Gentoo Linux. Read 
the whole article at Claybrook's blog[21], and join the discussion at the 
Forums[22].

Italian Linux Magazine Covers Gentoo
 
"Gentoo GNU/Linux - The Power of Optimization" is the title of an article 
written by Gentoo devs lu_zero and brain, aka Luca Barbato and Michele 
Balistreri that appeared in this month's Linux & C. magazine (issue #33). 
The seven page article gives an overview of what Gentoo represents and who 
it is designed for, and goes on to describe the installation process from 
the LiveCD in detail, with many tips and tricks on configuration issues, 
closing most appropriately with a wish for users to -- have fun. Bon 
divertimento indeed, check Linux & C.'s website[23] for details on how to 
order a copy of the magazine that also contains four CDs, two of which are 
filled with Gentoo 1.4_rc4 and lots of additional Gentoo packages.

Austria: Gentoo Vienna Community Holds Next Meeting on 5 August
 
And the wagon train moves on. Once more the Gentoo users of Vienna have 
decided to switch locations for their next meeting scheduled to take place 
on 5 August. The scarcely clad waitresses at the Vienna Hooters[24] will 
quite possibly be a distraction similar to the weirdos populating the 
Austrian communist party venue of the first Gentoo user group meeting 
earlier this year (see GWN report)[25], but some of the organizers seem to 
expect a higher motivation for people to turn up if they can be promised a 
glimpse of female bellybuttons over the rim of their laptop screens...

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Accessing the Kazaa network without Wine
 
This week's tip shows you how to use giFT[44] to access the Kazaa network 
without using WINE. 

 44. http://gift.sourceforge.net
 
The first step is to install giFT itself and the plugin for Kazaa network. 
giFT-fasttrack developers have not made an official release yet and the 
only way to get the plugin is through CVS. To install giFT run the 
following: 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.1:                                                       |
|Getting giFT                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                         |
|    # ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge gift                                 |
|    # ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge gift-fasttrack-cvs                   |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Note:  In both cases replace "~x86" with your architecture. 
 
Because giFT is only a daemon we need to install some client. There are a 
number of choices available. In portage you can find: 
 * giftcurs - console client based on ncurses library 
 * giftoxic - gtk2 client 
 * giftui - one more gtk2 client. 
 
The are other clients available as well (check giFT project page), but 
these are the ones available in portage. 
 
In order to configure giFT run giFT-setup. On the step when you will be 
prompted for the plugins enter: OpenFT:FastTrack. OpenFT has to be there, 
otherwise the whole thing won't work. 
 
Now, when we have installed and configured giFT you can run it by issuing 
this command: 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.2:                                                       |
|Running giFT                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                         |
|    % giFT -d                                                            |
|    gift_client_here (e.g.: giFTcurs for giftcurs package)               |
|    % giFTcurs                                                           |
|                                                                         |
