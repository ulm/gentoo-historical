Transition to NFP organization
------------------------------
  
Daniel Robbins[1], chief architect of Gentoo Linux is now heading an 
effort to make a transition to a NFP (not-for-profit) organization. The 
gentoo-nfp mailing list has been set up and discussion is already 
underway; the list has been archived[2], and is open to subscription: 
those interested should send a mail to gentoo-nfp-subscribe@gentoo.org. 
Daniel is targeting the end of April for finalizing the NFP effort, and 
has submitted a detailed proposal[3] to the mailing list, which has been 
discussed and clarified there.

 3. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.nfp/25
 
In the proposal, Gentoo Foundation, Inc. will hold the intellectual 
property of the project. It'll have a board of trustees, and will be an 
open membership trade association. The initial board of trustees will 
serve for a year, after which a new one will be elected. The Gentoo Store 
will pay for the establishment of this not-for-profit, as well as for the 
Gentoo Foundation's legal fees in applying for 501(c)(6) federal 
association status, which is expected to take around $5000. In addition, 
Daniel will retain royalty-free rights to use of the "Gentoo" trademark 
and the "G" logo, allowing him to continue him to run the Gentoo Store if 
he wants, in order to support his family and attempt to pay some of the 
$20,000 in debt he accumulated during his tenure as Chief Architect.

2. Gentoo Security
==================
  
CVS Server and Client Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------
  
There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the 
client. These vulnerabilities allow the reading and writing of arbitrary 
files on both client and server. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[4]

Multiple format string vulnerabilities in cadaver
-------------------------------------------------
  
There are multiple format string vulnerabilities in the neon library used 
in cadaver, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code when connected 
to a malicious server. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[5] 

 5. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200404-14.xml
    
XChat 2.0.x SOCKS5 Vulnerability
--------------------------------
  
XChat is vulnerable to a stack overflow that may allow a remote attacker 
to run arbitrary code. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[6] 

 6. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200404-15.xml
    
Multiple new security vulnerabilities in monit
----------------------------------------------
  
Two new vulnerabilities have been found in the HTTP interface of monit, 
possibly leading to denial of service or execution of arbitrary code. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[7]

Figure 3.1: Lance Albertson (aka ramereth)
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20040419_ramereth.jpg
 
This week we are featuring Lance Albertson [8] (aka ramereth), who is 
doing general system administration and monitoring for Gentoo. This 
involves managing monitoring tools for the Infrastructure Project[9], such 
as Nagios[10] server and implementation, Catci graphs, and whateverelse 
they come up with. He also helps with general system administration using 
cfengine and other tools. Furthermore, he helps infrastructure team in 
setting up new servers, when such need arises. He is making his first 
steps in ebuild maintenance by helping out with WOLK Kernel[11] and 
various ebuilds, which belong to netmon herd. Apart from all this Lance is 
taking part in Gentoo server project, throwing ideas and suggesting 
strategies.

Lance considers himself to be new to Linux, as his first serious 
experience with this OS started in January 2001. His first distro was 
Mandrake, on which he applied a so called "let's install everything 
strategy". However, he admits that he got bored with it and switched to 
Debian, which was a suggestion of his boss. Lance came across Gentoo 
sometimes in 2002, seeing his friend building it on a dual Pentium Pro 
box. In the beginning he found the idea to be "nuts" but 6 months later 
decided to give it a try (it was version 1.2 at a time), and as he says 
"fell in love instantly".
 
ramereth started his way to becoming a dev on #gentoo-server channel on 
freenode, where he was spending some time. That was when  Kurt Lieber[12] 
asked him if he wanted to help Gentoo with Nagios implementation.

 12. klieber@gentoo.org
 
He is most proud of the project he did once for the school. That was an 
irc- like server/client with xml-based message format. The commands where 
based on IRC standard, so one could join the channel become an op, 
kick/ban people etc. Moreover he was using flashes for the client which 
made it even more interesting. Even though he had a few known bugs, he 
still got a straight 'A' on it.
 
There are about 15 computers in his house, including x86/SPARC/PPC/Alpha, 
and all those he ever used run Gentoo. Lance prefers Gnome[13] desktop and 
first things he runs are evolution[14], gaim[15] and xterms. cfengine[16], 
irssi[17], screen[18], nagios[19] and cacti[20] are among his favorite 
tools.

Lance was attending a school school at Kansas State University, from which 
he graduated in May 2003 with a degree in Agricultural Technology 
Management with minors in Agronomy and Computer Science. Now he is working 
for RHS Inc., doing technical documentation and IT security. Apart from 
that he is also doing full- time farming with his family. Driving semi 
truck, combine and various tracktors is also on list of his skills.
 
When he doesn't work and doesn't do anything for Gentoo, Lance enjoys 
playing trumpet in jazz ensembles. He has been in the top big band jazz 
ensemble at k- state for several years plus was in the latin jazz combo. 
Also he likes playing racquetball, poker and hanging out with his friends. 
Now he lives in his own house in a small community Hiawatha, which is in 
northeast of Kansas. Though he considers his life to "laid back" it's 
quite easy to get away from it, cause Hiawatha is just two hours from 
Kansas City. And he does actually go there quite often! His favorite quote 
is "Where ever you go, there you are".
 
When I asked Lance to give me a sentence about Gentoo, he said: "Gentoo is 
the solution to total control."

Gentooified coLinux 
 
In an bid to add yet another way to run Gentoo under impossible 
circumstances, Danish Gentoo user janlaur[21] has volunteered a Howto on 
running Gentoo Linux as a native Windows thread, using coLinux (and 
involving a complete Gentoo installation contained in a 2 GB image file to 
be downloaded at some point). Anyone patient enough to try this, check the 
thread in the Documentation, Tips & Tricks section:

New Finnish Forum 
 
The Great Scandinavian Unification that the Forums saw about a year ago 
was intended to create a lively atmosphere among the nordic faction of 
Gentooism, mostly under the impression that Swedish was sort of a lingua 
franca for most of the region and looked like a good common denominator at 
first. But now the Finnish users, linguistically very different from, err, 
most of the planet's other humanoids, have achieved critical mass and 
decided they deserve a forum in their own language. Pleased to announce 
jaska[23] and Mikessu[24] as the new forum's inaugural moderators, 
tervetuloa 'n all that:

Linux Partiton Resizing Utilities  
 
There are plenty of commercial partition-resizing utilities on the market. 
But what about Linux ones? Here's a  thread[26] that talks about 
commercial and free utilities for all your resizing needs.

Ebuild overflow?  
 
Some capable Gentoo users have noticed that user-contributed ebuilds have  
not[27] been making their way into Portage on a timely basis. It comes 
down to developer overload, so if you've got some free time... become a 
Gentoo Package maintainer!

Italy/Switzerland: Joint GECHI and Ticino LUG Meeting 
 
On Friday and Saturday, 16 and 17 April, the notorious GECHI[28] group of 
Italian Gentoo users will join forces with the Ticino Linx User Group to 
organize a friendly event at one of three SUPSI (Scuola Universitaria 
Professionale della Svizzera Italiana) sites in Switzerland, this one 
located in a town called Manno, not far from the Italian border. Dates and 
times are to be taken with a grain of salt (check the TiLUG site[29] for 
details), but the Forum coordination thread[30] appears to have everything 
under control. And in any case, springtime in Ticino is supposed to be 
lovely....
