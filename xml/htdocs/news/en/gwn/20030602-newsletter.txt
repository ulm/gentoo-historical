North America gets two new source mirrors
-----------------------------------------
  
As most Gentoo users in North America know, source mirrors for Gentoo 
Linux have often been overloaded as the distribution continues to gain in 
popularity. Fortunately, the load will be eased somewhat with the addition 
of two new source mirrors, provided by the University of California, Santa 
Barbara[1] and pair Networks[2]. 

 1. http://www.ucsb.edu/
 2. http://promote.pair.com/click.pl
 
UCSB, located in sunny Santa Barbara, California, was recently ranked the 
14th best public university in the United States. Renown for its 
scientific research, UCSB professors recently won three Nobel Prizes in 
chemistry and physics for their landmark research. 
 
pair Networks provides world-class web hosting services to customers 
around the globe. With over 140,000 unique web sites and customers from 
150 different countries, pair Networks has established a reputation in the 
industry for outstanding service at reasonable prices. 
 
Gentoo Linux wishes to thank both pair Networks and the University of 
California, Santa Barbara, for their generous support of the project. 
Without their support, along with the support of our other sponsors, 
Gentoo Linux would not be the successful distribution that it is today. 
Users interested in taking advantage of these new mirrors can find more 
information on our mirrors[3] page.

CFLAGS/cpuinfo collection project
---------------------------------
  
One of the projects being worked on within the Gentoo Linux project is an 
application that will generate a recommended set of CHOST/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS 
for a given system. In order to make this application as useful and 
accurate as possible, we are in need of much sample /proc/cpuinfo data. To 
facilitate this, a web page[4] has been created with both submission forms 
and a quick submission tool. Users are encouraged to submit their 
information. The web page contains additional information about specific 
systems for which we particularly need more data.

Upcoming infrastructure changes
-------------------------------
  
The infrastructure that supports Gentoo Linux will be undergoing a number 
of changes over the coming weeks. These include: 
 
 * Migrating our DNS to an outsourced provider. 
 * Load balancing and failover services for the multiple servers that run 
   www.gentoo.org[5]. 
 * Moving bugs.gentoo.org[6] to a new, dedicated server. 
 * Moving cvs.gentoo.org[7] to a new, dedicated server. 
 * Distributing and de-centralizing our mail infrastructure, placing list 
   mail on one server and other mail on another server. 
 * Significant changes to the security infrastructure, including kernel 
   patches, chrooted environments for many of our public services,
   iptables scripts and other areas. 
 * Many other smaller changes.

 6. http://bugs.gentoo.org/
 7. http://www.gentoo.org/

Considerable effort will be put into ensuring these changes are as smooth 
as possible, with little or no direct impact to the user community. 
However, as with all things technology-related, unforseen circumstances 
and Murphy's Law generally crop up at the most inopportune times. Your 
patience as we work through these changes will be greatly appreciated.

2. Gentoo Security
==================
  
Summary
-------
  
 * GLSA: heimdal 
 * GLSA: nessus 
 * New Security Bug Reports 
    
GLSA: heimdal
-------------
  
A crytographic weakness in Kerberos 4 allows an attacker to impersonate 
any principal in a realm through using a chosen-plaintext attack. This 
vulnerability extends to the implementation of mit-krb5 (see the the GLSA 
in the April 7th GWN[8]) and the Heimdal implementation. 

 * Severity: Critical - Authentication compromise. 
 * Packages Affected: app-crypt/heimdal prior to heimdal-0.6 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge heimdal, emerge clean. 
 * GLSA Announcement[9] 
 * Advisory[10]

    MITKRB5-SA-2003-004-krb4.txt
    
GLSA: nessus
------------
  
The scripting engine in the Nessus security scanner has several 
vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary 
code would require a malicious user to have a valid account as well as 
tricking a user into running a script. 
 
 * Severity: Moderate - Arbitrary code execution, mitigated by requirement 
   for privileges by exploiter. 
 * Packages Affected: net-analyzer/nessus prior to nessus-2.0.6a 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge nessus, emerge clean. 
 * GLSA Announcement[11] 
 * Advisory[12]

A little reminder
 
Sadly we received no submissions for a user story during the last week. :( 
So it seems like a good time to remind you to send your experiences with 
Gentoo Linux which might be interesting to fellow Gentooers to 
user-stories@gentoo.org like Kai[16], Kenneth[17] and Mathy[18] did!

Fortunately we already have a candidate (who will be quite interesting, 
promise!) for the next issue, we just ran out of time for this week...
   
=================================
4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Jon Portnoy, aka avenj
 
This week we feature Jon Portnoy[19], whose duties in the Gentoo 
development team include recruitment and management of developers (along 
with Development Manager Seemant Kulleen[20]), coordination of releases, 
caretaking of the distfiles repository, and maintenance of some thirty or 
so ebuilds, including ICC[21], Intel's C++ Compiler. As developer 
recruiter and manager, Jon is the person project managers talk to when 
they want to get someone on the team, and oversees the training of new 
recruits (which is conducted by the original sponsor/mentor). He and 
Seemant also handle much of developer policy creation. As release 
coordinator, Jon oversees the entire release process, delegating tasks 
like stage building, QA, GRP building, and works to keep the release 
process flowing smoothly. All the while he makes sure the distfiles 
repository is in shape as much as possible, and has been working to 
integrate ICC into Gentoo Linux's current GCC-focused environment ever 
since he joined the development team. Jon had stopped in at freenode's 
#gentoo seeking help with a tricky initrd problem, ended up staying and 
helping people with their problems, and eventually got noticed by Seemant 
and joined the team as ICC implementor. He's proud of everything he's done 
for Gentoo, especially his management of developers and coordination of 
releases. 

 19. avenj@gentoo.org

Jon uses Enlightenment 0.16.5 with the Maw theme, as well as X-Chat 2, 
Mutt, Mozilla, XMMS, screen, and slrn (he's very active on 
comp.os.linux.advocacy and alt.os.linux.gentoo) on his workstation - 
cerberus, a P3 866mhz with 384MB RAM. He also finds the game Icebreaker 
very addictive. He also uses three other boxen: tempest, a P3 
development/testing box, eris, a K6-2 nameserver/proxy server, and 
lucifer, a celeron 1.8ghz dedicated to compilation. A student living out 
in the middle of nowhere in New Hampshire, Jon enjoys spending time 
outdoors away from his monitors, whether it be walking, biking, or 
kayaking. He also spends lots of time reading and studying history, 
especially Russian history. An aficionado of a variety of kinds of music, 
from Bob Dylan to Lucinda Williams to Juno Reactor to KMFDM, Jon is a 
particularly big fan of industrial music.

Spam, Spam, Spam, Baked Beans and Spam
 
Did you know that Episode 25 of Monty Python's Flying Circus is the reason 
we call it that? SPiced hAM has become a synonym for unsolicited, 
obnoxious commercial email clutter that enrages the Internet community. 
Gentoo users are no different, albeit a little more versatile in anti-spam 
combat, and the forums are witness to some of the more inventive ideas how 
to deal with the no. 1 nuisance on the Internet these days:

something new is not immediately reflected by the official Gentoo

OSnews Poll: And the Winner Is...
 
Whatever the significance of this may be: Gentoo beat all the other major 
distributions in this year's Linux popularity poll at OSnews.com, up from 
11 percent last year to exactly twice that share of the cake this time 
around. Interestingly enough, the thread that solicited Gentooists to go 
and vote (which at the current traffic experienced inside the Gentoo 
forums may well have contributed to the clear lead in the poll) even 
triggered one of the rare but welcome visits of Eugenia Loli-Queru[29], 
head mistress of everybody's favourite website, and Gentoo forum user with 
one of the earliest membership numbers around...

Performance of nVidia cards
 
In an uncommonly active thread, Spider called for the -user community to 
submit glxgear benchmark results of their Nvidia graphics cards. The 
submissions provide a good way to compare your hardware to others, 
allowing you to gauge any configuration errors that may be sucking 
precious FPS(frames per second). I'm sure we all appreciate Ernie Schroder 
whoopin' it up[32] in the 3D world.

** fixpackages **
 
As portage travels down the road of becoming the best package manager for 
Linux -- ever --, new features are thrown into the mix. After Tom 
Veldhouse updated portage, he was soon confronted with an unfamilar prompt 
to 'fixpackages'. Other community members may have experienced similar 
confusion. Brett Holcomb notes[34] that, "It's a new feature that fixes 
things when packages move from one category to another" and is located in 
/usr/lib/portage/bin/fixpackages. The gentoo-forums also developed a 
thread[35] discussing the new feature.

XFree
 
Seemant Kulleen posted[37] a message announcing the r3 (masked) release of 
v4.3.0.

 37. http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/8905
 
The plan for this 3rd release of xfree is to move all font building into 
seperate packages. However, though it has been released it still needs 
some work.
 
Menu system for all gentoo wm's
 
Also an exciting idea[38] was brought up to implement a 
windowmanager-independent menu layout system. A system which maintains 
entries for installated / removed programs in a non wm specific way. Much 
like the .desktop system from freedesktop.org.

Assigning unique system uid/gid for new ebuild
 
Considerable discussion took place regarding how to decide what 
uid/gid[39] the new package should run as. The plan apparantly is to make 
the installation process more flexible to include dynamically modifying a 
list of uids/gids. However for now everything is fixed around /etc/passwd, 
which is part of baselayout.

Documentation Translations
 
Fresh off the presses: Makoto Yamakura has announced an up-to-date 
Japanese version of the Gentoo Installation Guide (x86), available via the 
main Gentoo website. While the Japanese, Dutch, French and German 
translators have thus pretty much synchronized their documents with the 
current state of things, documentation in Spanish, Italian and Swedish is 
lagging behind by a few steps. If you want to contribute to the 
translation efforts for the Gentoo documentation, either by brushing up 
existing language versions or adding new ones, please contact John P. 
Davis[40].

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Export an X Session
 
This week's tip shows you how to run GUI programs remotely by exporting an 
X session and tunneling it over SSH. Note that this is heavily dependant 
on the speed of your network connection. If you're trying to run Mozilla 
off of a box on the other side of the country on a 56K modem it is 
probably not going to work very well. The best application for this is 
running programs over the same LAN or possibly a high-speed WAN. An easy 
example application is running gvim remotely so you can have a GUI editor. 
 
For this example we assume the local machine has an IP of 192.168.1.2 and 
the remote machine has an IP of 192.168.1.3. On the local machine you're 
going to need to give the remote machine access to connect to your X 
server. Use the command xhost to do this. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

|This command allows the machine with the IP 192.168.1.3 to connect       |
|# xhost +192.168.1.3                                                     |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
On the remote machine, you need to export the $DISPLAY variable to your 
local machine. After that, you should be ready to run GUI programs 
remotely.

|# gvim /etc/passwd                                                       |
|You should see gvim open on your local machine with the contents         |
|of the remote machine's /etc/passwd file.                                |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is very unsecure and not recommended since everything you type 
including passwords will be transmitted over the network unencrypted. 
To tunnel the connection over SSH and thus encrypt the traffic edit your 
/etc/sshd2_config file. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.3:                                                       |
| /etc/sshd2_config                                                       |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|Add or edit the following line                                           |
|ForwardX11     yes                                                       |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now connect from the local machine to the remote machine via ssh and start 
your X application. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.4:                                                       |
| Remote machine                                                          |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# gvim /etc/passwd                                                       |
|You should see gvim open on your local machine with the contents         |
|of the remote machine's /etc/passwd file.                                |
|                                                                         |
|Notice that you don't have to set the DISPLAY variable, ssh automagically|
|does that for you. You do however have to allow access to your local     |
|machine's X server (see above).                                          |
|                                                                         |
