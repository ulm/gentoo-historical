Gentoo Weekly Newsletter

This is the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter for the week of October 27, 2003.

1. Gentoo News

Summary
-------
  
 * Improved support for virtual hosting and web-based applications 
 * 2.6 kernel LiveCDs available for x86 and amd64 
 * Open kernel developer positions in the Gentoo Linux Project 
 * GWN seeking additional contributor 
    
Improved support for virtual hosting and web-based applications
---------------------------------------------------------------
  
In the coming weeks, the Gentoo Linux project will be releasing updates 
for Apache and all web-based packages, to make it easier to use Gentoo 
Linux on servers that host more than one website at once. As part of these 
changes, the default location of the 'htdocs' directory - the directory 
where your website goes - will change from /home/httpd to 
/var/www/localhost. For servers needing to support more than one website 
at a time, new tools - webapp-config and vhost-config - and a 'vhosts' USE 
flag will be introduced to help with managing and installing web-based 
applications and virtual hosts. 
 
The full technical details can be found in GLEP #11[1]. We'll be 
publishing webserver and virtual-hosting guides in the near future, as 
well as a new developers document explaining how to write ebuilds for 
web-based packages."

2.6 kernel LiveCDs available for x86 and amd64
----------------------------------------------
  
Thanks to Bob Johnson[2]'s hard work, we now have LiveCDs available for 
x86 and amd64 that use the 2.6 kernel. The x86 LiveCDs can be downloaded 
here[3], and the amd64 ones are here[4]. The 2.6 LiveCD for amd64 should 
be preferred over the 2.4 LiveCD because the 2.4 kernel did not provide 
the necessary hardware/driver support. Enjoy the new CDs!

Open kernel developer positions in the Gentoo Linux Project
-----------------------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Linux Project is seeking additional kernel developers to fill 
in some holes in the kernel team. Applicants should have a fair amount of 
experience with the Linux kernel. Send an email to Brian Jackson[5] if 
you're interested.

GWN seeking additional contributors
-----------------------------------
  
The Gentoo Weekly Newsletter is looking for one or more contributors to 
compile the Gentoo Linux Security section each week. No security expertise 
is needed because the information is gathered from GLSAs and bug reports; 
all you need is a solid command of written English. Send us[6] an email if 
you're interested.

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Michael J. Cohen
 
Our featured developer for this issue is Michael J. Cohen[7] (mjc), who 
some users may recognize as the maintainer of the -mjc kernel tree, is 
described on the Gentoo Developer List[8] as the "Resident Kernel 
Colonel". His primary responsibilities have been fixing things for the 
forthcoming move to the Linux 2.6 Kernel, QA, user support, and a brief 
bout with LiveCD development. Michael is also one of the Linux kernel[9] 
contributors and has contributed to userland filesystem utilities like 
e2fsprogs and reiserfsprogs. He is proud of his contributions to the 
kernel, particularly the opportunity to consult with kernel luminary Rik 
van Riel[10] about the rmap VM.

 10. riel@nl.linux.org
 
Michael is a long-time Linux user, having successfully (after 14 tries) 
installed RedHat 5.2 from floppies in a bid to move from FreeBSD. In 
January of 2001, Michael was approached by Daniel Robbins[11] to take 
responsibility for kernel maintenance for the nascent distribution. 
Michael accepted, and (after taking time to install it) began working as a 
Gentoo developer. He is only 19, having graduated from the McFatter 
Technical High School in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA. He is currently 
attending the University of Central Florida in Orlando, studying Computer 
Science and living on campus. He also works as a system administrator for 
an ISP. 

 11. drobbins@gentoo.org
 
Michael is currently using KDE, but claims Gnome as his favorite DE. He 
communicates using kmail and xchat-2. For his favorite apps, he selected 
k3b ("the first CD burning application that has worked as well as [he] 
expected"), the transcode video processing utilities, and the cscope 
source code browser. He also enjoys skateboarding, windsurfing, 
mountain-biking and working on his BMW or any Porsches that happen to be 
handy. For his favorite quote, Michael reminded us that Linus has asserted 
that "we all know Linux is great. It can do infinite loops in 5 seconds.". 
He also told us that "Gentoo is fast becoming the single distribution to 
offer both bleeding edge software and ease of use".

Choosing Compiler Flags Carefully 
 
Gentoo user Matt noticed something odd when running his C++ program on 
Gentoo... it was slower than Debian! Being that Gentoo is highly optimized 
compared to other distros he was somewhat confused by the results. He 
asked the gentoo-user mailing list for help, and what we all got was a 
very informative thread. Read it  here [15].

Headers and Tailers.
 
Here is an interesting post about whether it is possible to insert just 
the header files from a specific kernel version. Have a look[16] to see 
the results of the conversation.

Which dev to use?
 
No we aren't choosing between developers, they're all wonderful! :) 
However choosing between different /dev file system daemons is a choice 
for the future of gentoo. The existing one, devfs, has some competition 
from udev. Have a look here[17] to see the benefits and criticisms of both.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Displaying Runlevels
 
This week's tip is about a couple of utilities to help you deal with init 
scripts and runlevels. Gentoo Linux has four main runlevels: boot, 
default, nonetwork, single. To manipulate these, use the /sbin/rc-update 
command. While rc-update add and rc-update del are covered in the Gentoo 
Docs, you may be wondering how to see the runlevels a service is in. This 
is done with the rc-update show command. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.1:                                                       |
| rc-update show                                                          |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|Show all services and their runlevels                                    |
|# rc-update show                                                         |
|             apache2 |      default                                      |
|                 atd |      default                                      |
|         authdaemond |                                                   |
|            bootmisc | boot                                              |
|             checkfs | boot                                              |
|           checkroot | boot                                              |
|...many more lines truncated...                                          |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Note: You can also look in /etc/runlevels. Each runlevel is a separate 
directory and in those directories are symlinks to the various services in 
/etc/init.d. 
 
Another useful tool is rc-status which made its way into baselayout with 
Bug #4222[49]. It tells you which services are currently running:

|Show which services are running                                          |
|# rc-status                                                              |
|Runlevel: default                                                        |

|  cupsd                                                    [ started ]   |

|  ddclient                                                 [ started ]   |
|  local                                                    [ off     ]   |
|...and many more lines...                                                |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Finally, sometimes you may want to start all the services in your current 
runlevel that aren't running (because you stopped them). Simply type rc to 
start al the missing services.
