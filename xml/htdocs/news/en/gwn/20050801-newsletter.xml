    <title>Wanted: Translators for German documentation</title>
    <body>
      <p>The German translation team is looking for new translators.  According
        to our webstats the German docs are the most read after its original
        language English.  So they should be updated as good as possible, but
        unfortunately some of them are already badly outdated.  For updating
        the translations some more helping hands and brains are needed.  If you
        are good in English and German and want to help out, please send an
        email to the German lead translator <mail

    <title>Second Bugday anniversary!</title>
    <body>
      <p>August 6th, 2005 marks another exciting milestone for the Gentoo Bugday
        project - a very successful project that helps bring the community a bit
        closer.</p>
    </body>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>A trip down memory lane...</title>
    <body>
      <p>It all started as an idea by Gentoo Developer <mail
          link="iggy@gentoo.org">Brian Jackson</mail> a little more than two
        years ago. Digging in various mailing lists the first traces seems to be
        from around July 2003 when Brian posted a request for comments to the
        gentoo-dev mailing-list on <uri
          link="http://glep.gentoo.org/glep-0006.html">GLEP 6</uri>.  The thread
        can be read at <uri
          link="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/9880">in the
          gmane archive</uri>. Everybody seemed to like the idea and the GLEP
        was accepted in record time - it took less than a month from submitting
        the GLEP to getting it accepted.</p>
      <p>The very first Gentoo Bugday was held on August 2, 2003 and was quite
        successful in many ways. Lots of bugs were fixed and several new devs
        were recruited.</p>
      <p>When Brian Jackson took a brief break as a Gentoo Developer, Bryan
        Østergaard took over coordinating Bugday activities and have been in
        charge of Bugday since May 2004.</p>
      <p>The next big chance came in September 2004 with the grand opening of
        <uri link="http://bugday.gentoo.org/">http://bugday.gentoo.org</uri>.
        The website was mostly implemented by <mail
          link="gurligebis@gentoo.org">Bjarke Istrup Pedersen</mail> and looked
        almost exactly like it does today.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Bugday in numbers</title>
    <body>
      <p>Figuring out how many bugs are squashed due to Bugday is probably
        impossible but there's some interesting (or at least amusing numbers) to
        be gained from bugzilla. Asking bugzilla how many bugs (in a closed
        state) were changed during every Bugday so far, we will get a few (not
        very scientific) statistics:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <ti>Most bugs closed during one Bugday period:</ti>
          <ti>344 (feb 2005)</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Least bugs closed:</ti>
          <ti>124 (aug 2003)</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Average bugs closed per Bugday:</ti>
          <ti>229</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Average bugs closed in 2003:</ti>
          <ti>173</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Average bugs closed in 2004:</ti>
          <ti>226</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Average bugs closed in 2005:</ti>
          <ti>274</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Developers recruited from participating in Bugday:</ti>
          <ti>15+</ti>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </body>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Looking forward</title>
    <body>
      <p>Fast forwarding to summer 2005 Bryan slowly realised that he needed
        some help if he wanted to take Bugday any further. So he recruited <mail
          link="tannewt@gentoo.org">Scott Shawcroft</mail> and <mail
          link="gurligebis@gentoo.org">Bjarke Istrup Pedersen</mail> to help
        with a few of Bryan's ideas. Fortunately they have a few ideas of their
        own as well!</p>

      <p>One of the main goals of holding Bugdays is to build the community
        while solving bugs.  In its current state Bugday participation is
        limited. With some changes we hope to increase involvement, build the
        community and groom new developers. Some of the changes we plan on
        implementing include a from-scratch rebuild of the website and an IRC
        interface to the new site.</p>

      <p>Our goal with the new website is to provide more direction for Bugday
        participants and allowing a greater degree of participation. One way
        we are going to do that is by classifying bugs by level of difficulty
        and the coding-language requirements of bugs. This should allow users to
        filter bugs by their own skill level.</p>

      <p>In addition to bug classification we are also going to provide a bug
        voting interface. In short, it will allow users to vote for their
        favorite bug(s) and thus (hopefully) increase the chance that somebody
        submits a fix for that bug.  We hope this will get some of the more
        annoying bugs fixed quickly as it should be evident which bugs people
        want the most to get fixed. It's important to note that this 'bug
        voting' feature will only be implemented on the <uri
          link="http://bugday.gentoo.org">Bugday website</uri>.</p>

      <p>We hope some of the planned website features will be ready by September
        and would appreciate all comments, suggestions and questions regarding
        current and upcoming Bugdays.</p>

      <p>Join us on <uri
          link="irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo-bugs">irc.freenode.net at
          #gentoo-bugs</uri> and check out the website at <uri
          link="http://bugday.gentoo.org/">http://bugday.gentoo.org</uri>.</p>

      <p>Remember, everyone is invited to celebrate both the two year
        anniversary and a new beginning for Bugdays on the upcoming
        Saturday!</p>

  <title>User Stories: Interview with George K. Thiruvathukal</title>
  <section>
    <body>
      <p>This time in featured Gentoo User Stories we present you <e>George K.
          Thiruvathukal</e>, professor of computer science at Loyola University
        Chicago.  Gentoo Developer <mail link="patrick@gentoo.org">Patrick
          Lauer</mail> did the interview which has been arranged with the help
        of Gentoo Developer <mail link="kingtaco@gentoo.org">Mike
          Doty</mail>:</p>

      <p><e>Tell us about you. Who are you, where do you work?</e></p>

      <p>”I'm a professor of computer science at Loyola University Chicago. We're
        based in…ehem…Chicago, IL USA.“</p>

      <p><e>What is your job? What computer-related tasks does that
          involve?</e></p>

      <p>”Professor and Graduate Program Director. I'm also the de facto director
        of computer systems who has a lab manager, Miao Ye, working with me on
        Linux and open source stuff. Because my research is in parallel and
        distributed systems, I basically have spent about one third of my life
        as a sysadmin/hacker.“</p>

      <p><e>When did you discover Linux? When Gentoo? What convinced you of
          Gentoo?</e></p>

       <p>”I discovered Linux in 1991. I was working in a company while
         completing my Ph.D. studies here in Chicago. A colleague of mine and I
         installed one of Linus' early kernels and were hooked ever since. I
         started using Gentoo a couple of years ago at the steadfast insistence
         of one of my students, Sean McGuire. I had already realized (Sean just
         pushed me over the edge!!) that most of the other distros, while nicely
         packaged in some cases, were not using a good foundational approach
         that made it easy to build everything from source and keep packages
         up-to-date.  Worse, the other approaches were fundamentally limited for
         my work in high-performance computing, which depends on being able to
         squeeze every last drop of performance when absolutely required. I was
         particularly with Gentoo's ability to compile both kernel and packages
         easily for the processor (family) of interest.</p>

       <p>At present, two small computing clusters are running Gentoo
         exclusively.  Mike Doty (KingTaco) and I are working on a completely
         PXE/netbooted setup, which should be deployed within the next few
         weeks.“</p>

       <p><e>On what machines have you deployed Gentoo? What are your plans for
           the future?</e></p>

       <p>”Everything Linux in our department is running Gentoo—even our Linux
         lab machines. We have a transparent setup that uses OpenLDAP as the
         authentication strategy, large-scale storage running on Dell PowerEdge
         servers (yes, we got Gentoo working on them with some minor
         pain/suffering along the way.) and several home built servers for
         e-mail and web access.</p>

       <p>My future plan—a dream at this point—is to have a 1000+ 64-bit system
         running Gentoo. :-) Think big!“</p>

       <p><e>How do you handle updates etc.?</e></p>

       <p>”Eek, I knew you would ask me a tough question. Well, at present, we
         sync metadata automatically on most critical servers at least once a
         month.  With system/world updates, we do tend to exercise caution on
         critical systems, and limit updates to once every 3-6 months. With more
         experimental machines (ok, our clusters) we update early/often. As
         we're now going to more of a netbooted setup, we can prepare the image
         (more or less once) and then just reboot machines to absorb the
         updates.</p>

       <p>Obviously, updating <path>/etc</path> files is one of my minor gripes
         with Gentoo, but I am seeing this as an opportunity to help the Gentoo
         team in the future. As I do a ton of work with Python and XML, I have
         in mind a tool that, I think, will make /etc maintenance a little less
         troublesome and error-prone.“</p>

       <p><e>In general, what problems did you encounter? Where does Linux (and
           Gentoo in general) have advantages?</e></p>

       <p>”In general, we've encountered few problems. I feel particularly
         blessed that I still have good hacking/coding instincts as I am now in
         my late 30's and trying to keep up with all you crazy 20-somethings.
         I'm also blessed to have had talented folks like Mike and Sean around
         to help with certain kernel and desktop matters.“</p>

       <p><e>Where does Linux fail? What (solution|deployment|hack) are you most
           proud of?</e></p>

       <p>”I'm most proud of our LDAP setup. The Gentoo documentation at the time
         more or less said it couldn't be done, and I was able to get it
         working—and securely, to boot. There were some broken ACLs that I was
         able to fix and demonstrate are working properly. We now use it for
         many of our systems within the department.</p>

       <p>I'm also proud of the work I've done with my colleague, Prof.
         Konstantin Läufer, which amounts to having built our own "hosting"
         service within the department. We are able to do v-hosting of various
         community/academic portals within our department, which includes
         e-mail, web, and content management via Plone. All of it works entirely
         on Gentoo, better yet.“</p>

       <p><e>I heard that you made some computers available for Gentoo
           development - what convinced you to do this?  What hardware? What do
           you get in return? </e></p>

       <p>”Well, a big part of my university is an emphasis on service to others.
         It's our great honor to repurpose the Sun E250 hardware for Gentoo
         development purposes. We hope that one day students who want to study
         about open source technologies will consider our department as a good
         choice. Not only do we teach about open source in many of our classes,
         we actually use it!“</p>

       <p><e>How are the responses from others when they hear that you are using
           Gentoo on "critical" systems? How do you see the OpenSource /
           commercial software split? Any reasons to (not) use
           OpenSource?</e></p>

       <p>”Well, most people assumed I was insane to begin with, so the responses
         are about the same. :-) My view is that you are at risk regardless of
         what you use for critical systems. If you don't keep software
         up-to-date, keep track of key security advisories, or don't employ best
         practices, can you really say that you are committed to "mission
         critical" results?</p>

       <p>Our view is that critical systems also require the best hardware. In
         reality, the OS is only as good as what it's running on. For critical
         systems, we use high-end hardware with strong processor, memory, and
         I/O performance. I've seen no evidence that Gentoo is any more or less
         secure than the others. Seemingly, the folks at Gentoo think security
         is important, judging by the weekly updates mentioned in the
         newsletter.  Are all of the other distributions doing the same thing to
         keep their users informed?</p>

       <p>We don't discriminate against commercial software. However, in a time
         where budgets are tight, there needs to be a case that commercial
         software is worth the trouble. Also, I wish to point out that students
         get plenty of support for the commercial alternatives (and way of
         thinking) from our IS department, which provides ample support for the
         Windows desktop. Our CS department also has a membership in the MSDN
         Academic Alliance so our students can choose to learn about open source
         or commercial technologies. We're not ideologues but think our students
         <e>should</e> learn about open source as part of a CS education.“</p>

       <p><e>What are your experiences with support? What makes Gentoo good,
           what makes it difficult? What (dis)advantages would a commercial
           distribution like RedHat or SuSE offer?</e></p>

       <p>”Gentoo does need to rethink a few things:</p>

       <p>1. Syncing metadata is beginning to take too long. This isn't a big
         deal when there is one system, but it's a big deal when there are many.
         There should be a clear/documented way to sync one "master" copy, which
         can be used to perform local syncs.</p>

       <p>2. The <path>/etc</path> updating problem is a serious one for
         servers. I have a workaround but often find myself having to check
         manually to ensure key <path>/etc</path> files (e.g.
         <path>conf.d/net</path>, <path>fstab</path>, and
         <path>modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path>) don't get broken.“</p>

       <p><e>Thank you for the interview.</e></p>

    <title>”Best practices for portable patches“</title>
    <body>
      <p>Gentoo Developer <mail link="flameeyes@gentoo.org">Diego
          Pettenò</mail> wrote an article on <uri
          link="http://programming.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/07/19/1713230">”Best
          practices for portable patches“</uri>, based mostly on his experience
        as a Gentoo package maintainer and the Gentoo/BSD port. It offers a nice
        overview of common problems and how to prevent them, which is especially
        important for Gentoo as it runs on many different processor
        architectures.</p>

    <title>Catching emerge messages with enotice</title>
    <body>
      <note>Gentoo's Tips and Tricks is not responsible for breaks on your
        system, although we test the printed Tips and Tricks.  The online
        version should be preferred over the email version, as it may contain
        updates.</note>
      <p>One thing portage is lacking for a long time is catching all the
        notices and warnings during compilation, so that you know what changed
        during your latest nightly update.  You know the bugs where something
        isn't working any more since the latest update, just because you didn't
        read the warning that scrolled up the screen while you didn't watched
        the compile-process?  Here is a solution: <c>enotice</c>!</p>
      <p><c>enotice</c> is a tiny script from Gentoo Developer <uri
          link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~eldad/">Eldad Zack</uri> and has been
        updated by Lindsay Haisley.  For installation you should download 
        Thomas Bullinger's <uri
          link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~eldad/enotice/install-enotice.sh">enotice
          installation script</uri>.  After downloading, call the script:</p>
      <pre caption="Install enotice">
# <i>sh install-enotice.sh</i>
      </pre>
      <p>This script downloads and copies enotice to
        <path>/usr/local/sbin/</path>.  It also adds the variable
        <c>PORT_ENOTICE_DIR</c> to your <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.</p>
      <p>Now, after your nightly update you can just call <c>enotice</c>, which
        gives you a nice list of notices and a self-explanatory menu.  Usually
        only warnings will be shown, but you can change the level in order to
        show also further notices.</p>
      <p>Finally the GWN team heard rumours that something like enotice will be
        included into the next big version of portage…</p>
