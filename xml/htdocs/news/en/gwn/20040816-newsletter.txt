This is the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter for the week of August 16th, 2004.

Various Infrastructure Upgrades for Gentoo
------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo infrastructure received some good news this week with the 
donation of two new servers. One seerver, a dual Xeon with 2GB of RAM, 
will be used to augment capacity in the main rsync.gentoo.org rotation. 
The other server, a quad Xeon with 1GB of RAM, will be used as a master 
bittorrent server. Gentoo Linux would like to thank Melior, Inc.[1] for 
providing these servers to the Gentoo Linux project.

Additionally, Gentoo Linux recently received a donation from EMC[2] for a 
license of VMWare GSX Server[3], which will be used to assist in 
development efforts of our various internal projects.

Finally, a new, custom list archiving solution is now in closed beta and 
will be released to the public soon. This archive solution will allow 
public, read-only access of all our mailing lists, including the 
gentoo-trustees mailing list. We expect to have this solution publicly 
available within two weeks. 
    
==================
2. Projects Update
==================
   
Documentation
 
The Documentation Team have recently completed a work cycle to review a 
large number of the "bugs" reported for documentation, and have 
implemented a large number of minor corrections to wording or content in 
the documents. They also have a new Status Update[4] that describes a 
number of major revisions, including: a new Quick HOWTO on su with X, 
extensions to the Gentoo Installation Tips 'n Tricks, major edits to the 
Gentoo Security Guide and several updates to the Gentoo Handbook.

Infrastructure
 
The Infrastructure team are currently working on moving the Forums server 
to faster hardware - this upgrade will consist of moving the Apache server 
(currently a a dual PIII 1GHz/1GB) and database server (dual Xeon 2.4 
GHz/2GB) to new platforms: a dual 2.4GHz/1GB and a 3.0GHz/4GB, 
respectively. This should substantially improve Forums performance, 
especially during peak loading. 
 
Security
 
Gentoo is currently working towards inclusion on the vendor-sec[5] mailing 
list, a limited-access mailing list that includes many major Linux 
vendors. Membership on the list would permit early access to security 
alerts and related discussions, prior to general release of the issue.

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Benjamin Judas
 
Figure 4.1: Benjamin Judas

This week, we feature Benjamin Judas[17](beejay), the Gentoo Release 
Co-ordinator for the x86 architecture. This responsibility involves 
managing and developing the x86 release media, including the stage 
tarballs, Live-CDs and GRP installation sets, as well as working with the 
documentation team to ensure that the install documentation is current. 
For the recent 2004.2 release, Chris Gianneloni[18] managed the creation 
of the LiveCD images, allowing Benjamin to focus on the other aspects of 
the release. This new division of labour, including the sharing of release 
engineering responsibilities, is likely to be maintained for future 
releases. However, Benjamin retains primary responsibility for managing 
and scheduling release points for the x86 platform. 

 17. beejay@gentoo.org
 18. wolf31o2@gentoo.org
 
Although Benjamin had been reading about Linux since 1994, it wasn't until 
1998 that he took the opportunity to install and use it. His initial 
introduction was somewhat prosaic: he was "walking through Friedberg (a 
small town nearby) trying to find some new shoes." He then recounts that 
"since I didn't find any good looking shoes, I went into a computer store 
to spend my money there instead." The result was a spanking new set of 
SuSE-Linux 5.3 Mini-Edition install media. "Hey, 30 bucks...you can't do 
anything wrong with that price for 6 CDs." He then tells us that it took 
him 6 months to have the OS working properly and the remainder of a year 
to strengthen that knowledge. A few years later, an article by Thomas 
Raschbacher[19] in a German Linux magazine lead him to Gentoo. On August 
18th, 2002 (he recalls the date because he ran his first emerge system 
while at a friends birthday party), Benjamin downloaded and installed the 
new distro and never looked back. 

 19. lordvan@gentoo.org
 
Benjamin's first contribution to Gentoo took the form of an apache-based 
online help system, which he asked Alexander Holler, who managed 
www.gentoo.de[20], to post for him. Alexander gave him rights on the 
server and encouraged him to contribute, so Benjamin continued by 
assisting with translating materials for the German website. By the Fall 
of 2003, Benjamin had begun using his nascent python skills to hack 
portage with an interest to developing a Web-based portage front-end. 
While working on his first task, a package search engine, he was 
approached by Seemant Kulleen[21] and asked if he would work on Gentoo in 
a more formal capacity. Benjamin started out as a QA assistant for x86 
releases, testing the Live CDs, stages and packages. When Seemant gave up 
his role co-ordinating the releases, the responsibilities were picked up 
by Benjamin. In addition to his work on www.gentoo.de and the Release 
Engineering Team, Benjamin was  co-founder[22] of the German Gentoo-NFP 
(Not-For-Profit) Organization, Friends of Gentoo e.V.[23]. This group 
represents a formal organization to collect and manage contributions, 
financial and otherwise, toward fostering and protecting Gentoo 
development in Germany.

Benjamin works on a collection of four computers that reside around his 
home desk: an Athlon-Thunderbird 1300 and an IBM Thinkpad R40 are his main 
working platforms. These are supported by a Sun Ultra 5 which provides 
DNS, SMTP and IMAP services and an SGI Indy "which doesn't have a 
particular task - It just sits there and tries to look good." He has 
recently fallen in love with the zsh shell, and uses vim and catalyst 
while developing. Evolution, rxvt-unicde, tvtime and Mozilla round out the 
list of his most-used applications - excepting the occasional round of 
UT2k3, Simcity 3000 and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2. 
 
In real life, Benjamin works at the University Medical Centre of 
Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, providing desktop application support. 
He has a formal qualification as an Assistant for Information Technologies 
- roughly equivalent to a practical diploma in Computer Science. He 
describes himself as a "typical couch potato". He enjoys watching 
television and movies - with a penchant for Science Fiction and Horror, 
with the occasional helping of televised Car Racing. He is an avid reader, 
and is currently negotiating China Melville's "Perdido Street Station", 
which he recommends. Benjamin lives in Muecke-Merlau, a small village 
about 80 Km from Frankfurt, in the Vogelsberg region of Germany - situated 
on an ancient dormant volcano. He asked for the opportunity to thank 
Seemant, Daniel, John and Jeff: "Thanks for trusting me and believing in 
me, helping me and providing constructive Critics!" He also had a message 
for the Gentoo devs collectively known as "The German Conspiracy": "Thanks 
for all the hard work to make Gentoo look good in Germany!". And finally, 
for the rest of us: "Gentoo is like a Goodyear-tire: if it doesn't run 
straight anymore, you refresh the profile and it will work again."

5. Heard in the Community
=========================
  
gentoo-user
-----------
  
Always Working as Root
 
Many hardend Linux and Unix people know that consistently logging in as 
root isn't a good idea. However many newcomers from the Windows world are 
not really sure why this is not a good idea. On Windows, most people log 
in with administrative privileges more often than not. So why should it be 
any different on Linux? A Linux newcomer asked this question on 
gentoo-user and got some great reasons, and suggestions for simplifying 
his transition to a Unix way of life.
