<title>New USE defaults in the making</title>
<body>
<p>
For some packages portage has auto-use entries, which means that
unless you explicitly override a USE flag it will be enabled after
emerging a package and disabled after unmerging it. Example: after
"<c>emerge sqlite</c>" the <path>sqlite</path> flag will show up as 
enabled in "<c>emerge info</c>" and "<c>emerge -vp</c>" of something
that has <path>sqlite</path> in <path>iuse</path> unless you have
"<path>-sqlite</path>" or "<path>-*</path>" in USE in <path>make.conf</path>. 
If you unmerge <c>sqlite</c> the USE flag will show up as disabled 
again (unless you have <path>sqlite</path> in USE in <path>make.conf</path>
of course).
</p>
<p>
This has caused some annoyances as USE flags tend to "randomly" jump
when a new package triggers auto-use (either because you emerged or
unmerged it or because the <path>package.use</path> file in the tree was
edited). Many bugs have been filed, the general consensus is to phase
out auto-use.
</p>
<p>
The change will happen in one of the next Portage 2.1 releases - it is
in the tree and marked ~ARCH on almost all arches. "Stable" users will
stay unaffected for some time since Portage 2.0.x will not change its
behaviour, but upgrades can and will change USE flags. If you just
upgraded to a portage 2.1 release you will probably want to look at the
"<c>emerge -DuvpN world</c>" output and add flags that you want to keep
enabled to <path>make.conf</path> if they show up as "<path>-foo*</path>".

<title>Baselayout changes</title>
<body>
<p>
The Gentoo baselayout team is pleased to release <path>baselayout-1.12.0_pre14</path>
to the eagerly awaiting public. Here's a summary of the major changes since 1.11:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Network backgrounding support from wpa_supplicant, ifplugd and 
netplug with service dependency restart</b> -- Typically <c>ifplugd</c> is 
used to monitor ethernet cable being in/out and start/stop the network service 
accordingly, along with the services depending on that network service. The 
problem was that when <c>ifplugd</c> re-started the network service it didn't 
restart the services it stopped! Now <c>ifplugd</c> and <c>netplug</c> support 
have been merged into <path>baselayout</path>, we have more direct control and 
can remember which services were stopped by the network service so we can 
re-start them. <c>wpa_supplicant</c> can now do this too.
</li>
<li>
<b>Separate network configuration per interface</b> -- Each interface is 
now able to have its own <path>resolv.conf</path> and default route. We 
also prioritize wired over wireless and merge resolv.confs together. This 
works great for roaming laptop users.
</li>
<li><b>Interactive startup</b>  -- Do you have a service that causes serious 
issues when booting? You should not, but if you do then you can now choose 
to start, skip, continue or drop to shell for each service interactively. 
Using generic <path>stty</path> and shell calls we do this in a non-blocking 
way without the need for a daemon. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Parallel startup/shutdown improvements</b> -- Parallel startup and shutdown 
didn't really do what it claimed to in previous releases, but now it's very 
parallel and much faster than before. Which leads us onto ....
</li>
<li><b>Improved service dependency ordering (albeit slower)</b> -- Thanks to 
parallel startup, we found that our service ordering was totally wrong. So we 
had to re-write it entirely. So far it's in its fourth re-write using a 
topological sort written in bash and has been doing a very good job for around 
three months now so we think we've finally cracked it.
</li>
<li><b>Service daemon status checks</b> -- Services that launch daemons via 
start-stop-daemon now ensure that they really start instead of start - become 
daemon - die due to invalid config fooling <c>rc</c> into thinking they have 
started. Also, if you check a service status we check if the daemon is still 
running or not. If not then we stop the service and dependencies. We also 
really stop the service, which fixes an issue where you start <c>cups</c>, 
re-emerge <c>cups</c> and then it cannot stop or restart.
</li>
</ul>

<title>Gentoo PPC meeting defines roadmap for 2006.0 and beyond</title>
<body>
<p>
The PPC developers spent three hours on Sunday night to discuss what lies 
ahead of them. The 2006.0 release for PowerPCs will include generic stages 1, 
2 and 3, specific stage3 tarballs for G3 and G4, both a minimal and a complete
install CD, plus GRP packages on a separate CD image. All 2006.0 profiles,
generic and optimized, will include NPTL support.
</p>
<p>
The PPC team will tackle some of the open bugs when another PPC bugday will focus 
the efforts of developers and users. If you'd like to participate in weeding out 
some of the undergrowth, tune into <path>#gentoo-ppc</path> on <path>irc.freenode.net</path> 
next Saturday, 21 January 14:00 UTC. Before starting a recruitment campaign for 
new develpers, the team is currently evaluating who among the 21 listed PPC devs 
is currently active or de-facto retired. Along with boosting the activity level 
within the team, they're also planning to enhance communication with other 
architectures and users by starting a mark-up of their blog posts and sending 
heads-up to the GWN team on a regular basis.

<title>AMD 64 project update</title>
<body>
<p>Major highlights from the Gentoo Linux for AMD64 activities have been included 
in a status report published by the Gentoo AMD64 project last week. As the hardware
has become more affordable, 2005 saw the user base grow a lot, and the number of
developers didn't stand back: The AMD64 team started with nine developers 
at the beginning of 2005, and currently counts 32 active developers, plus 16
"arch testers", i.e. power users putting the development under close scrutiny and
filing bug reports. The "arch testers" concept works so well that the idea has 
gained popularity with other architectures who are now considering setting up tester 
teams of their own. See <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/amd64/status/status_20060110.xml">the entire 
report</uri> for more accomplishments of the AMD64 team.

<p><b>New toolchain on SPARC</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo SPARC developers are getting ready for the 2006.0 release. 
<uri link="gustavoz@gentoo.org">Gustavo Zacarias</uri> has marked a 
new <c>gcc</c> (3.4.5) and <path>glibc</path> plus 2.6.11 kernel 
headers stable. The change will not affect those still using the old 2005.1 
profile, but as this upgrade demands users to re-emerge their entire 
system, you may want to check the thread for useful information before 
you get bitten by anything that didn't go as planned:

<title>USA: Utah Gentoo user group</title>
<body>
<p>
<mail link="sdibb@myway.com">Steve Dibb</mail> is the founder of a group of 
Gentoo users in Utah. Located in West Jordan, he's recently set up <uri 
link="http://utah-gentoo.org">a website</uri> that uses "a vanilla install of 
Geeklog" to provide state-wide support and articles about Gentoo (first entry 
is a review of <mail link="dams@gento.org">Damien Krotkine's</mail> <c>flagedit</c> 
tool), and serves as a starting point for future activities like meetings and 
installfests. "Utah is actually a cool place for all the Linux support going 
around," says Steve, which orginally made him worry a bit: "I had sent out <uri
link="http://uphpu.org/pipermail/uphpu/2005-October/004078.html">an e-mail</uri> 
a few months earlier to see if there was any interest, and to my surprise there was quite 
a positive response to the idea, despite that fact that there are already
a lot of local Linux, Unix or other FOSS groups and mailing lists in the state." 
The one-month-old Gentoo Utah group now counts eleven members, all of whom use 
Gentoo in both production and private environments. On top of the website Steve
is hosting a mailing list where "we don't get flamed for using Gentoo like we 
would on the other local mailing lists" and which benefits from being small and
local: "The list gives us a chance to discuss Gentoo, without being flooded from 
a larger userbase."

<title>Allround PC (9 January 2006, in German)</title>
<body>
<p>
Building a home theater PC (HTPC) with Gentoo Linux is a typical example of the 
benefits obtained from setting up only a minimal installation. It's been done 
several times before, of course, but this <uri
link="http://www.allround-pc.com/index.php?reviews/06009/bericht.htm">step-by-step 
description</uri> of the process provides a concise overview of which hardware 
to use, where to configure which modules, how to integrate remote controls 
and more. As some of the elements used are not yet part of the official Portage 
tree, the article also points to the <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.de/main/de/downloads.xml">gentoo.de overlay</uri> that 
contains additional VDR plugins needed for the HTPC setup.

Ladislav Bodnar from Distrowatch picked up a piece of Gentoo documentation,
the new <uri link="/doc/en/liveusb.xml">Gentoo Linux LiveUSB Howto</uri> that 
"has now become part of the project's official documentation," and which <uri
link="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20060109#1">he finds</uri> 
"particularly useful for installing Gentoo Linux on a modern laptop with no 
CD-ROM drive."
