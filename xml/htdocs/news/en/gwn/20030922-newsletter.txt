 * Gentoo 1.4 maintenance release 1 for x86 
 * Experimental IA-64 stage1 available 
    
Gentoo 1.4 maintenance release 1 for x86
----------------------------------------
  
New 20030911 builds of Gentoo 1.4 are now available on mirrors[1] and at 
the Gentoo Store[2] so this may be a good time to reburn your CDs or to 
order some copies of the LiveCDs. This maintenance build has the same 
functionality as the 1.4 release but fixes many bugs. Also, if you 
installed Gentoo with the 1.4 release there's no need to worry because the 
releases are only relevant for the LiveCDs and GRPs; run emerge rsync; 
emerge -u world and your Gentoo system will be as up-to-date as anyone 
else's.

Experimental IA-64 stage1 available
-----------------------------------
  
The IA-64 port can now be fully built from stage1, and an experimental 
IA-64 stage1 tarball is now available under experimental/ia64. There's no 
LiveCD, but users are encouraged to try building a system, see how it 
works, and submit bugs to Bugzilla[3].

 * GLSA: mysql 
 * GLSA: exim 
 * GLSA: pine 
 * GLSA: openssh 
 * GLSA: sendmail 
    
GLSA: mysql
-----------
  
Quote from advisory: 
 
"Anyone with global administrative privileges on a MySQL server may 
execute arbitrary code even on a host he isn't supposed to have a shell 
on, with the privileges of the system account running the MySQL server."
 
 * Severity: High - execute arbitrary code. 
 * Packages Affected: <mysql-3.23.57-r1 <mysql-4.0.13-r4 
>=mysql-4.0.14-r2(masked) 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge dev-db/mysql/<mysql version>; emerge 
clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[4] 
 4. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-announce&m=106362878312500&w=2

GLSA: exim
----------
  
"There's a heap overflow in all versions of exim3 and exim4 prior to 
version 4.21. It can be exercised by anyone who can make an SMTP 
connection to the exim daemon."
 
 * Severity: Low - heap overflow 
 * Packages Affected: <exim-4.21

 * GLSA Announcement[5] 
 5. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-announce&m=106363184515705&w=2
    
GLSA: pine
----------
  
"A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists within the parsing of the 
message/external-body type attribute name/value pairs. Failure to check 
that the length of the longest attribute is less than the space available 
allows a maliciously formed e-mail message to overwrite control 
structures."
 
 * Severity: High - Remotely exploitable buffer overflow 
 * Packages Affected: <pine-4.58 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge pine, emerge clean. 
 * GLSA Announcement[6]

GLSA: openssh
-------------
  
"All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7.1_p1 contain a buffer 
management error. It is uncertain whether this error is potentially 
exploitable, however, we prefer to see bugs fixed proactively."
 
 * Severity: Low - Buffer Management error 
 * Packages Affected: <openssh-3.7.1_p1 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge ssh, emerge clean. 
 * GLSA Announcement[7]

GLSA: sendmail
--------------
  
"Fix a buffer overflow in address parsing. Problem detected by Michal 
Zalewski, patch from Todd C. Miller of Courtesan Consulting."
 
Fix a potential buffer overflow in ruleset parsing. This problem is not 
exploitable in the default sendmail configuration; only if non-standard 
rulesets recipient (2), final (4), or mailer-specific envelope recipients 
rulesets are used then a problem may occur. Problem noted by Timo 
Sirainen."
 
 * Severity: High - Buffer Overflow 
 * Packages Affected: <sendmail-8.2.10 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge sendmail, emerge clean.

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Brian Jackson
 
Figure 3.1: Brian Jackson
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20030922_iggy.jpg
 
We are pleased to present Brian Jackson[10], who has gone by the handle 
iggy for the better part of a decade. Brian maintains the courier MTA 
package, as well as working on the gentoo-cluster project[11] and 
assisting with patch maintenance for the kernel team. He modestly 
describes his duties as "mostly bug-fixing" and kernel "patch monkey", and 
keeps an eye peeled for prospective new developers while participating in 
the recently-inaugurated Gentoo Bugdays[12].

Brian lives in Montgomery, Texas, just outside Houston. His home enjoys a 
surfeit of mammals: three cats, 300 lbs of Great Dane (in two discrete 
packages) and a wife share the space. He also seems to have an infestation 
of computers, with an Athlon XP 2600 (2 GB, NForce2) main workstation, 
Athlon XP 1800 (1 Gb, Radeon) media server, P2 450 file server, two Epia 
boxen for cluster testing and a pair of test servers. Given the situation, 
his lament that he has "poor air conditioning" seems particularly poignant.
 
He is a professional network administrator and programmer who has 
unfortunately recently been numbered among the victims of IT startup 
failures - a situation unlikely to continue for long. He currently works 
from a home office decorated with a lava lamp and a sumo penguin. Brian 
attended the US Navy's Nuclear Power School, and enjoys working with sport 
compact cars when not working on his computers. When he finds time, he is 
a skilled cook. He also spends a lot of time with his pets, and generally 
starts his day by letting the dogs out before retiring to his office and 
computers.
 
Brian first began using Linux in the mid-1990's, trying out Red Hat and 
SuSE before a friend firmly admonished him to start using Slackware. He 
first heard about Gentoo on a Linux news-site about a year ago, and 
migrated to it once he had confirmed that lilo was available as a 
bootloader. Brian is a KDE user, generally having KMail and a number of 
Konsoles open at any given time. One of the Konsoles is invariably 
connected to a screen'd IRSSI client running on one of his servers. In 
addition, he uses Kate for editing, courier for his MTA, and is fond of 
the djbdns DNS server. When asked to provide a favorite quote, Brian cited 
Edmond Burke: "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good 
men do nothing."

Life on the Bleeding Edge
 
Accepting the ~x86 keyword is usually not near as unstable as people might 
think. Nonetheless: on occasion, very nasty things are known to happen. 
They may not be that big a deal if you're a developer and used to your 
system breaking apart every now and then, but ~x86 is being followed by 
newbyish to intermediate Gentooists, too. They like to stick to it to get 
the latest and greatest software across all genres, even if they know they 
could be in for a bumpy ride. Nothing wrong with that as long as you 
manage to stay in the saddle, but on occasion the horse turns its head and 
delivers some very painful bites...

KDE 3.1.4 and 3.2 Alpha
 
The forums have been teeming with threads about KDE last week, with the 
appearance of both KDE 3.1.4 (including a brief episode of chicken-and-egg 
blocking of Qt 3.2.1 ebuilds), and - more importantly - the first alpha 
version of the next major minor release bump scheduled for early December: 
KDE 3.2. The ebuilds for the latter are still masked, but Gentoo KDE lead 
caleb[14] who started both forum threads encourages people to test the new 
version...

Germany: Regional Gentoo Meetings
 
Separated by only 24 hours and 98,5 kilometres, two regional German 
Gentooist gatherings are going to take place in October. The Ruhrgebiet - 
a sprawl of dozens of loosely connected cities with a total of 5,5 million 
inhabitants - Gentoo faction elected a quite appropriately oversized steel 
and glass complex located in Oberhausen, the Centro[18], as their venue on 
8 October, 19:00 hours. Meanwhile, the Bonn bunch has (tentatively) 
decided to meet on 9 October in a classic grassroots community location, 
the Netzladen[19], just one day later, on 9 October. Details for both 
meetings are being swapped via forum threads, click here for 
Oberhausen[20] or here for Bonn[21]. Busy week for people who'd also like 
to attend the Practical Linux day in Gieéen[22] two days later - and 
another 155,6 kilometres west...

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
An introduction to info
 
This week's tip introduces the info command. Just about everyone has used 
the man command to look up information on a command, but the info command 
is less well known. However, it's actually the preferred documentation 
method of many programmers. So if man doesn't have what you're looking 
for, try using info instead. 
 
info uses the concept of nodes for information. Each page of information 
on a topic is a node and you can navigate between nodes using n to move 
forward and p to move backwards. To get started with info, just type info 
at the command prompt. There's an easy to follow tutorial you can view by 
typing h or, for just a list of available commands, type ?. 
 
If you're looking for documentation on a specific command, you can use 
info command (e.g. info tar). If you're not quite sure what the command 
name is, but want to search, add the --apropos=STRING option. For example, 
if you're looking for documentation on mysqld, you could use info 
--apropos=mysqld. This displays a list of nodes with information on 
mysqld. 
 
This is just an introduction to info, but hopefully it will help you get 
to know your system a little better. Remember, to get started with the 
primer, use info and the press h.
