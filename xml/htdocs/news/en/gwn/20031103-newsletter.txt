Embedded Gentoo seeking interested developers
---------------------------------------------
  
A group of Gentoo developers comprising Chris PeBenito[1], Arun Thomas[2], 
Ned Ludd[3], and Abhishek Amit[4] are looking for people interested in 
helping get Embedded Gentoo restarted. They've restarted the 
#gentoo-embedded channel and a proposal has been submitted, but some 
planning needs to be done before any projects are started. Send one of 
them an email if you want to help out, or post to the thread[5] on 
gentoo-dev if you have any ideas.

Patrick Kursawe

This week's featured developer is Patrick Kursawe[6] (phosphan), a 
frequent contributer and maintainer of ebuilds. When he has time, he also 
provides general bug-squashing services in the sci (scientific) and video 
herds. 

 6. phosphan@gentoo.org
 
Patrick grew up in Essen, Germany and now lives, works and goes to school 
in Bochum. He works for the Computing Centre of the Ruhr-Universit√§t 
Bochum, where he is currently a doctoral candidate in Analytical 
Chemistry. In fact, Patrick is scheduled to complete his studies in 
December, which accounts for his lack of significant time to devote to 
Gentoo just at the moment. He lives with his companion-in-life Natalia and 
enjoys the aquatic pursuits of canoeing, sailing, scuba diving and 
snorkeling. On land, he is an avid reader and fan of standard and latin 
dancing, as well as studying Aikido. He reflects that, despite being a 
professional and hobbyist user, "there's more to life than computers, even 
if they're running Gentoo Linux". 
 
The saga of Patrick's elevation to developer status is entirely documented 
in Bug 17019[7], and was summarized by him with the observation that 
"after a half a dozen or so ebuilds stuffed into bugzilla they maybe 
thought it was less trouble if they gave me CVS access". Patrick first 
tried Gentoo on a test server after reading about the distro in the spring 
of 2002, and within a few months he had converted four other computers to 
Gentoo, saving only a lonely SuSE box to serve a reference platform. This 
was a fairly substantial shift for someone who had been a dedicated SuSE 
user for the five years previous, and reflects his thoughts on Gentoo: "if 
you don't think one size fits all, you should give it a try." 

 7. http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17019
 
Patrick is a Windowmaker user, and lists as his favorite applications (in 
no particular order): mutt, vim, knews, mozilla, apache, kvoctrain, cups, 
perl and gcc. When asked what application he first launches on startup, 
Patrick responded "init". The author declines to comment on the sort of 
sense of humour that represents.

Gentoo-related Jobs Forum Created
 
It's not as if the other forum categories had been crumbling under the 
onslaught of job advertisements recently, but the Forum administrators, 
anticipating the future popularity of this particular type of postings, 
have now set up a forum for job offers directly related to Gentoo Linux. 
If you have jobs for developers in the field of Gentoo Linux available, do 
post a short message to this forum (after a good, long look at its very 
specific guidelines):

Centrino WLAN Chip Support in Linux
 
One of the main reasons for people staying away from laptops and notebooks 
using Intel's Centrino technology used to be the lack of Linux support for 
the wireless LAN mini-PCI card included in that platform. While Intel 
seems to be indifferent about it, Linuxant[10] (of Linmodem fame) has 
released commercial NDIS-driver wrappers for this and other hardware 
drivers in the open so that Linux users can actually benefit from the 
hardware features they bought with their portable PC, by using the Windows 
drivers inside their Linux configurations. Check this thread for a 
discussion of both Linuxant's and Intel's attitudes, and user experiences 
with Linuxant's drivers:

Desktops and Windows
 
While the first KDE 3.2 beta ebuilds are continuing to blossom on the 
portage tree, other leaner and meaner window managers do have their 
followers, especially among Gentooists traditionally fond of things with a 
small memory footprint. Flavour of the week seems to be XFCE4, but unlike 
most Linux support mailing lists that carefully avoid this type of 
discussion for fear of (f)lame wars, one of the strengths of a web-based 
forum is that people can explore and compare the virtues of window 
managers and desktop environments without getting scolded for cluttering 
bandwidth. Check some threads on current trends in making X look good:
 
 * KDE 3.2 now in Portage[13] 
 * Between a WM and a DE[14] 
 * Made the Switch to XFCE4[15] 
 * The F? Virtual Window Manager[16]

Locking a user out.
 
A problem with locking a user out of system with usermod commands is that 
often they can still log in using ssh etc. Have a look at this[19] post 
for some potential remedies for this ailment.

Russian Forum In Spe Looking for Moderators
 
The Gentoo Forums are busy looking for one or more Russian speakers to 
take on the responsibilities of moderating the new Russian forum in the 
works. The current global moderators are unable to watch over even the 
first few days of a new forum in a language none of them speaks all that 
well, which is why it'll only be created after someone managing it from 
the inside is found. Go to this thread[20] to announce your intentions.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Scheduling with "at"
 
This week's tip shows you how to schedule events in Gentoo Linux with the 
at command. While cron is the more common scheduling utility in Gentoo 
Linux, at is useful for scheduling one-time events, or simply setting a 
task to run at some date/time in the future. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.1:                                                       |
| Getting at                                                              |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# emerge sys-apps/at                                                     |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now that at is installed, the daemon must be started so that scheduled 
jobs can be run. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.2:                                                       |
| Starting atd                                                            |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# /etc/init.d/atd start                                                  |
| * Starting atd...                                                [ ok ] |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now you can start using at. 
 
Note:  For security you may need to edit /etc/at/at.allow and 
/etc/at/at.deny. See the manpage for more information on securing at.

Now there are two jobs scheduled which will be run 'at' the specified

don't want a job to run, you can can use the atrm command.
