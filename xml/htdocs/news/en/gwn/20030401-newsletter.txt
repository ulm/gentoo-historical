Portage 2.1 to adopt RPM format for LSB compliance
--------------------------------------------------
  
In what will likely prove to be a controversial decision, Portage 2.1 will 
adopt the RPM format for all packages moving forward. The use of ebuilds 
will be deprecated in favor of the defacto RPM standard. The primary 
driver for this decision was to ensure compliance with the Linux Standard 
Base[1] specification, which mandates RPM support for package management.

The developers have been hard at work to make this migration as easy as 
possible. Already a proof-of-concept ebuild2rpm script is in place and 
being tested by a pilot group of developers. Unfortunately, because of the 
architectural differences between the two formats, some features will not 
be supported once Gentoo moves to RPM. USE variables are one such feature; 
sandbox security is another. However, the added benefit brought about by 
full LSB compliance should far outweigh the loss of these two minor 
features. 
 
Additionally, because of LSB's required library support[2], the xfree86 
package will move to become part of the base Gentoo Linux system, rather 
than an optional addition. Users interested in learning more about the 
Linux Standard Base should read the LSB FAQ[3] or the full LSB 1.3 
specification[4].

Gentoo/PPC team restructuring
-----------------------------
  
As announced in last week's issue[5], Mark Guertin (gerk) recently retired 
from the Gentoo Linux project. Replacing Mark as the Gentoo/PPC lead will 
be Pieter Van den Abeele (pvdabeel). Assisting Pieter in the PPC 
development efforts will be Luca, Graham, and Seth, who have been 
appointed as second-tier leads for the group. The new structure provides 
for more distributed leadership on the PPC developer team and offers more 
flexibility and redundancy.

Release schedule announced for Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc4
---------------------------------------------------
  
Brad Cowan (bcowan) recently announced the release schedule for Gentoo 
Linux 1.4_rc4: 
 
 * Sun March 23rd - Package Upgrades Phase Starts - The development team 
is encouraged to move things from unstable ("~" masked) state to stable 
for the next 14 days. 
 * Sun March 30th - Build and Test Phase - Generic CPU stage tarballs are 
made and tested from the current CVS tree for the next 7 days with jhhudso 
and QA testers reporting any bugs found. 
 * Sun April 6th - End Package Upgrades phase - Start Build and Test Phase 
with an official CVS snapshot. 
 * Wed April 9th - Official Release Decision - a determination is made as 
to whether this next release will be an "official release" or release 
candidate. The Development Lead for each arch, the Release Coordinator, 
the Development Manager, and the Chief Architect all come to a final 
unanimous decision in this matter.

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Karl Trygve Kalleberg
 
 
Karl Trygve Kalleberg[23] maintains dev-lisp and dev-java with a few other 
developers, as well as several other languages and compilers and the 
eminently useful gentoolkit. This mostly entails fixing ebuild bugs and 
verifying new submissions; Karl also spends much time arguing with the 
other developers about how to improve Gentoo Linux's development process, 
a goal for which he has crafted tools like lintool and munchie. A Gentoo 
developer since summer 2001, Karl has worked on many other OSS projects, 
including the Savage3D driver for the Utah-GLX project[24], the Linux port 
to the Sega Dreamcast[25], a multi-language documentation system[26], the 
Norwegian translations of AbiWord[27] and the Gimp[28] (the first to 
Bokmål, the latter to Nynorks, two different dialects of Norwegian), and 
some other projects you can see listed on his personal page[29] at 
SourceForge, but most of these projects, as well as his involvement with 
Gentoo were preempted by his Master's thesis: transformations for the 
CodeBoost transformation system[30] which he presented on the 21st of 
March at the University of Bergen[31]. Now he's back in all of his 
capacities, including that of comic relief for the Gentoo development 
team.

Karl has a nice dual Athlon 2000+ box with a Kyro II video card and an IDE 
RAID, but as of late he only visits it through ssh. He's currently 
borrowing an Athlon 1800+ running Redhat (his excuse: it's nice to know 
what the other distros look like once in a while), and is waiting for a 
replacement for his iBook, which he bought in January and which has broken 
down twice (Karl says that Apple's customer support is the worst service 
he's come across, including the tax authorities, but will gladly use an 
iBook if Apple decides to send him a working one). He uses Fluxbox and KDE 
depending on the occasion, with Galeon and Sylpheed for browsing and mail. 
Karl's other favorite apps include zsh, most, irssi, and ssh, and he 
suffers from withdrawal symptoms whenevr he tries to ditch the bloated, 
horrible, emacs, which is nevertheless home. 
 
Karl used to design computer languages until the company he worked for 
caved in last summer, and afterwards he worked at a very cool ISP[32]. Now 
unwittingly applying for a PhD position in computer science, he continues 
to study medicine at the Norwegian university of Technology and 
Science[33] as a break from all the CS. Also, he enjoys various forms of 
roleplaying, generally Ars Magica interspersed with some happy-go-lucky 
Sci Fi stints. Believe it or not, his girlfriend's name is Tilde; the fact 
that she works for an evil cell phone company[34] is offset by her 
understanding of obscure Unix jokes[35], and she lives with him in 
Trondheim, Norway[36]. Karl was born in the coastal town of Haugesund but 
escaped to Bergen when he discovered that not all city halls were supposed 
to be pink[37]. The city hall in Bergen[38] was nondistinct, and there he 
was subjeced to Solaris and IRIX before he accidentally installed Linux 
and was not able to get it off. 

Karl left the link between Bergen and Trodheim in a shroud of mystery, as 
to appear inscrutable.

CFLAGS Central Revival
 
Floating point conversion functions in GCC, the standard C compiler suite, 
are susceptible of creating bugs when compiling with -march=pentium4. Some 
people circumvent this by "downgrading" to -march=pentium3, some deny 
bugginess altogether. Say hello to a renewed discussion of compiler 
optimizations: 
 
 * gcc 3.2.2 and Pentium4[39] 
 * -march=pentium4 issue[40] 
 * -fomit-frame-pointer[41] 
 * Making full use of cpu registers in CFLAGS[42]

Gentoo Migration Strategies
 
Matt Garman asked about migration strategies[46] for moving from Debian to 
Gentoo. The resulting thread[47] gave Matt some helpful hints and also 
touched upon the "requirement" of having a separate, 100MB boot partition.

Money Dance is Not Dead
 
Alex Combas inquired[49] about running Money Dance[50] on Gentoo. There 
was some confusion about whether or not Money Dance was still an 
actively-developed program, but it was eventually clarified[51] that Money 
Dance is, in fact, still an active product.

Gentoo Hanami
 
Cherry blossom season in Japan. While the weather report of Japanese TV 
stations still brings daily coverage of the full-bloom-front that is 
slowly moving towards the north of the country, the usual GentooJP 
suspects have already fulfilled their traditional "hanami" duty last 
Friday. For those unfamiliar with the expression: Hanami is a cherry 
blossom viewing event better described as an annual mass hysteria with the 
aim of getting seriously drunk in a park with preferrably large numbers of 
cherry trees and watching the petals float gently to the ground while 
noisily dancing around on much too blue plastic sheets. Roughly a dozen of 
GentooJP activists decided on Shinjuku Gyoen as a venue, a particularly 
nice and fairly central spot in Tokyo, but believe it or not: nobody 
brought a camera... Hoping for next year then, lads. 
 
German Police Runs on Gentoo-ARM
 
Government agencies in Europe are known to be much more open towards Linux 
and Open Source Software than those of other countries. In their latest 
move, the BKA[57] (the German equivalent of its more universally known 
cousins FBI or Scotland Yard) has started deploying Gentoo-ARM-based PDAs 
for use of its officers in the field. "They will mainly use it for playing 
MP3s of phone conversations in abduction cases", says Hein Bloed, head of 
the IT department at BKA's headquarters in Wiesbaden. PDAs have been part 
of the standard equipment at the BKA for many years, but the sudden 
decision to replace PocketPC with ARM-based Gentoo Linux came as a 
surprise. The Gentoo-ARM developer team says there are rumours of a 
PocketPC virus accidentally spread throughout the organization by their 
own computer crime department following a raid on illegal software 
importers in the port of Hamburg two months ago.

==================
  
Synchronizing System Date/Time with rdate
 
This week's tip shows you how to keep your system's date and time synced 
without the hassle of NTP. The command rdate allows you to get the time 
from a server running NTP but doesn't require you to set up your own NTP 
server.

To sync your computer clock, run rdate -s. You should probably change 
which server you use so as not to overload one particular one. Here is a
