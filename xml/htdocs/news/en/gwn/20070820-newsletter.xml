<!-- Question 1 -->
<p>
<b>In what way do you see yourself helping to fulfill the role of the 
council?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><c>Wernfried Haas (amne):</c> Communication, decision making, having a 
strong council, and resolving the Code of Conduct situation. Communication: 
While the council is the governing body of Gentoo, it is important to stay in 
touch with the people who voted for the council in the first place. That means 
announcing meetings, posting logs and summaries thereof so people know what you
are doing. If no one else does, I would be willing to take care of this. 
Decision making: As I see it, the council is supposed to make decisions, but 
not work them out by itself. The best way to do so is gathering input from the 
whole community and decide what's best instead of having a closed process that 
only involves the council members and a select few. Having a strong council: I 
think the council should be strong in its decisions, but they should be made 
based on the input from the community. Get the CoC situation fixed: Without 
specifics, I'm interested in finally having a solution that enforces the CoC on
both users and developers and has clearly defined roles and authorities without
overlaps between different projects. That doesn't mean moderating opinions, but
clearly saying no to abusive behaviour, from whomever it's coming. I also think
that social problems should and cannot be solved with technical solutions 
alone, but only human interaction.</li>
<li><c>Petteri Räty (betelgeuse):</c> For the most part, taking part in the 
discussions and actively pushing things forward as needed.</li>
<li><c>Donnie Berkholz (dberkholz)</c> declined to answer, alternatively he 
suggests that you read his 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/voting-logs/council-2007-nominees.xml">manifesto</uri></li>
<li><c>Tobias Scherbaum (dertobi123):</c> As I'm a silent-guy who's following 
lists and discussions constantly, I do not take part in most of them; however, 
I recognize the pro's and con's of suggestions from an other point of view than
people have when they're actually involved with this specific discussion. This 
allows me to make decisions based on what's good for Gentoo or on what's a 
better technical implementation.</li>
<li><c>Diego Pettenò (flameeyes):</c> I really don't, as it is, as the past 
council's have had no actual role, just one more bureaucratic organ. I hope 
things change this time, but I won't count on it.</li>
<li><c>Markus Ullmann (jokey):</c> As being part of the dev crowd for about one
and a half year now, including being lead of a project for more than a year, I 
think I have seen enough tops and flops to know what is good for Gentoo and 
what is bad.</li>
<li><c>Roy Marples (uberlord):</c>By providing level headed judgement in 
technical decisions. I may also brandish a large stick when necessary.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<p>
<b>What drives you to run for the Gentoo Council?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><c>Wernfried Haas (amne):</c> Because I care. I guess some people may 
disagree with what I'm suggesting or what I did before, e.g. as the proctors 
lead. Feel free to do so, no offence taken. In any case my motivation is that I
care about Gentoo and its future. If you think my ideas are bad and I suck, 
feel free to vote for someone who sucks less.</li>
<li><c>Petteri Räty (betelgeuse)</c> declined to answer, alternatively he 
suggests that you read his 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/voting-logs/council-2007-nominees.xml">manifesto</uri></li>
<li><c>Donnie Berkholz (dberkholz)</c> declined to answer, alternatively he 
suggests that you read his 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/voting-logs/council-2007-nominees.xml">manifesto</uri></li>
<li><c>Tobias Scherbaum (dertobi123):</c> The time I've spent with Gentoo in 
the past few years has shown my involvement. Starting as a user, helping others
in the forums and on mailing-lists, I quickly started contributing. First with 
German translations of GWN and documentation, for which I became responsible 
quite fast. Afterwards I took the ebuild quiz and helped our PPC team in 
maintaining the stable-tree and started building the release-media for HPPA, 
plus I'm maintaining several packages. Running for the council is another 
logical step of involvement.</li>
<li><c>Diego Pettenò (flameeyes):</c> I made clear in the past, in my blog, 
what I think of the council and the way it's currently useless; if my fellow 
developers will decide to vote for me, it would be a clear sign that enough of 
them wants to see something done, for good or bad.</li>
<li><c>Markus Ullmann (jokey):</c> In the opensource community you don't moan 
about others not doing the right thing, you simply do it yourself.</li>
<li><c>Roy Marples (uberlord):</c> I didn't run for Council, I was nominated by
more people than I thought possible. So you could say I'm driven by the 
community.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Question 3 -->
<p>
<b> What qualifications do you have for running a large open source 
project?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><c>Wernfried Haas (amne):</c> I've been one of the Gentoo Forums leads for 
a while, and so far they haven't kicked me from that job. I think I understand 
the social processes within Gentoo quite well, including integrating the forums
mods officially into Gentoo, and some first hand experience from spending some 
time in devrel and the proctors project.</li>
<li><c>Petteri Räty (betelgeuse)</c> declined to answer, alternatively he 
suggests that you read his 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/voting-logs/council-2007-nominees.xml">manifesto</uri></li>
<li><c>Donnie Berkholz (dberkholz)</c> declined to answer, alternatively he 
suggests that you read his 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/voting-logs/council-2007-nominees.xml">manifesto</uri></li>
<li><c>Tobias Scherbaum (dertobi123):</c> I was responsible for managing German
documentation translations within Gentoo a while ago, but no real experience in
running a large OSS project.</li>
<li><c>Diego Pettenò (flameeyes):</c> None, I suppose; I'm not one of the 
longest time developers, I don't have much experience with leading projects, 
opensource or otherwise, I'm more a simple jack, and I like being one. But 
jacks might be something the council needs more, to stop caring about the 
"political" views and start tackling technical issues.</li>
<li><c>Markus Ullmann (jokey):</c> As already pointed out in the first 
question, I am lead of more than one project already and they seem to work out 
nice so it must be okay how I handle things. Other than that, I've lead and 
organized some larger projects with 60-80 people, so even managing larger 
groups of people is not completely new to me.</li>
<li><c>Roy Marples (uberlord):</c> 2.5 years of Gentoo baselayout development I
lead the Gentoo/FreeBSD effort. Both of these involve a large amount of 
interaction with other Gentoo projects and our user community.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Question 4 --> 
<p>
<b>How do you think that your participation will help Gentoo resolve it's 
problems or attain its goals?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><c>amne</c> declined to answer but suggests you reference his answers to 
question #1.</li>
<li><c>Petteri Räty (betelgeuse):</c> I am usually cool headed and base 
decisions on facts, not emotions. As for the goals, they should be defined 
first.</li>
<li><c>Donnie Berkholz (dberkholz):</c> By proposing solutions to the problems 
and concrete suggestions for reaching our goals, then putting them into action.
I've already begun some of this on my blog with a recent post on improving our 
code quality.</li>
<li><c>Tobias Scherbaum (dertobi123):</c> Gentoo doesn't have any general goals
we're trying to achieve. Based on the input I got after my talk at the Gentoo 
UK Meeting, defining such general goals and getting people to agree on them is 
nearly impossible, or at least very difficult. Defining goals within projects 
(and lots of projects already do this!) will help Gentoo much more in my 
opinion. But we need to be more open about this. The problems include 
gentoo-dev flamefests and the constant lack of manpower. The first one is 
partly resolved with splitting up -dev into the -dev, -project, and 
-dev-announce mailinglists. The other part of that particular problem isn't 
solvable, we'll always have to deal with - lets call them - "special" people, 
they're part of our community like everyone else. We can't change them, we need
to change or way of interaction and communication with them. The second one can
only be solved by being more open and trying to get even more people involved 
with Gentoo. Sunrise was a good start, we need more projects and ideas like 
this! I'm aware that we have some other problems as well, but yeah .. I've 
chosen these two.</li>
<li><c>Diego Pettenò (flameeyes):</c>Not by being in the council: goals are 
attained by doing what needs to be done, not by discussing no one knows what. 
Most of the problems of Gentoo are technical and are usually solved by 
analysing the issue and implementing a solution. Up to now most of the issues 
were analysed and over-analysed, solutions were proposed, and discussed 
"ad nauseam", but never actually implemented. I know, it sounds harsh and 
negative, but I made myself clear before on thinking the Council hasn't been 
doing anything good, me included, so it shouldn't come as a surprise.</li>
<li><c>Markus Ullmann (jokey):</c> People seek for goals to work towards. We 
have both users and developers with quite good ideas which just either sit 
around or are dropped due to inabilities or no motivation. I'd like to pick 
those up and motivate people to get back to them or find other options like 
involving others. From what I see, at the moment, we just lack motivation. We 
have many really skilled devs already and the group still grows more. So the 
aim for me is obvious.</li>
<li><c>Roy Marples (uberlord):</c> My participation with solve neither, but 
hopefully make the eternal journey smoother.</li>

This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri

packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
