<title>1000 days: Gentoo Forums</title>
<body>
<p>When it went online as <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=2">gentoo.frozenliquid.net</uri> 
on 6 April 2002, Kyle Manna aka <mail link="nitro@gentoo.org">nitro</mail> had set up the first Gentoo forum server 
on a 2 mbit/s down, 380 kbit/s upstream cable connection, and was hosting it out of his home. A thousand days 
later, the forum statistics look almost frightening, with more than 70,000 registered users and more than 1.8 million 
posts in the database. The <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Forums</uri> are the most popular support 
forum of any single Linux distribution, and one of the biggest implementations worldwide of the <uri link="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</uri> forum software 
they've been running on from day 1.</p> 

<figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_forumstats.png"
  short="Stats" caption="Forum statistics on 2 January 2005 - 1000 days!" />

<p>Gone are the glorious days of M5, the machine that hosted the Forums after their migration to 
NYU in June 2003, which also accommodated the Gentoo Bugzilla and rsync5.us, the fastest rsync 
server under the sun of its time because it was running rsyncd out of the ramdisk... Last August, 
the Gentoo Forums had to migrate again, to their current location at <uri 
link="http://www.osuosl.org/">OSU OSL</uri> on two hyperthreading Dual 2.4GHz and 3GHz Xeon 
servers with several gigabytes worth of RAM and plenty of disk space. With 2000 posts a day  
contributed by up to 1800 concurrent users, the administrators and moderators have been sleeping 
much better since the move. </p>

<p>Speaking of whom, this GWN <uri link="#doc_chap2_sect2">proudly presents</uri> portraits of a number 
of Forum moderators and administrators. Not all of them wanted to give up their anonymity, some didn't 
include pictures. But no matter what their background, affiliation or resident country may be, together they've been 
providing the platform for one of the most coveted aspects of Gentoo Linux: its outstanding user community 
and their Forums. </p>

<title>Website redesign mailing list</title>
<body>
<p>Sven Vermeulen (<mail link="swift@gentoo.org">Swift</mail>) has announced the next steps in the process
of implementing the website redesign contest results at the actual Gentoo website. "I hope to
welcome lots of contributors that are willing to donate some of their free time to the development 
of this redesign." says Swift, who set up a new mailing list to coordinate the effort, currently
composed of the original designer <uri link="http://www.aaronshi.com/gentoo/">Aaron Shi</uri>, the Gentoo 
developers involved in the decision on which design to retain, and already a handful of determined 
non-dev contributors with experience in web design.</p>

<p>"This mailinglist is primarily meant for discussions on the layout of the
Gentoo website (from which we can deviate a bit, but not much, since it was
elected by our community), the structure of the Gentoo website (think
sitemap) and the backend of the Gentoo website (the underlying XSLT code and
XML formats)." continues Swift. If you're a knowledgeable web designer, content
aggregator or generally good with XSLT and XML, and would like to join the group 
that looks into the tasks at hand, please contact Swift directly. </p>

<title>Gentoo Documentation Project update</title>
<body>
<p>New highlights have been added to the collection of Gentoo documentation, most notably two contributions
by <mail link="airuike@gmail.com">Eric Brown</mail> who wrote a remarkable <uri link="/doc/en/keychain-guide.xml">user manual</uri> for Gentoo's own <c>keychain</c> and a <uri link="/doc/en/cron-guide.xml">Cron Guide</uri>. Other updated documents include the <uri
link="/doc/en/distcc.xml">distcc guide</uri>, the <uri
link="/doc/en/guide-to-mutt.xml">quickstart guide to mutt</uri>, the <uri
link="/doc/en/altinstall.xml">Alternative installation guide</uri>, <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml">Gentoo FAQ</uri>, the <uri
link="/doc/en/virt-mail-howto.xml">Virtual mail hosting HOWTO</uri>, and the <uri
link="/doc/en/migration-to-2.6.xml">Migration to Linux 2.6 Guide</uri>, and of course all available language versions of the 2004.3 handbook that have been updated to reflect the same status as the English original.</p> 

<p>The status update also speaks of a split of the installation instructions, into one release-specific (networkless from disk) installation handbook, and instructions for a current Portage based installation via the Internet. Check the <uri link="/proj/en/gdp/status/status_20050102.xml">Project update page</uri> for other interesting details.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <body>
                <p> Every wonder about the real identities of the shadowy demigods that rule the
                        <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Forums</uri>? GWN staff, in a
                    hazardous undercover exclusive, have uncovered some of the true faces of the cabal that
                    have taken it upon themselvves to ensure the orderly and efficient progress of
                    what <uri link="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/awards/">Linux Format</uri> has
                    identified as one of the best support resources of 2004. The article below
                    identifies a few of those who have tirelessly pursued duplicate posts, sorted
                    threads into the proper categories, and walked boldly unarmed into OTW
		    (except for Pilla and his trusty lead pipe).</p>

            <title>Moderator Profiles</title>
            <body>
                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_akar.jpg" short="Akar Chen S.L." caption="Akar Chen S.L."/>
                <p>
                    <e>Akar Chen S.L. (akar)</e> is one of the Gentoo Chinese forum moderators. He
                    also is the leader of Open Source Hong Kong Fonts Project, a sub-project of
                    the Unifonts initiative led by Arne G&#246;tje (CJK TrueType fonts). </p>
                    
		    <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_haas.jpg" short="amne" caption="Wernfried Haas"/>
                    <p>
		    <e>Wernfried Haas (amne)</e> is currently studying at the University of
                    Technology in Graz and working on his diploma thesis. He read about Gentoo in
                    November 2002 on the mplayer-users mailing list just when SuSE no longer met his
                    needs. He uses Gentoo at home and work for everything, including a workplace
                    backup and printserver. Wernfried joined the moderator team in December 2003 in
                    the German forum and became a Global moderator in Spring 2004. ( "Report a Dupe
                    every now and then until someone is fed up with moving your Dupes and makes you
                    mod.") He usually visits these forums in the following order: German, Networking
                    &amp; Security, Gentoo Chat, Gentoo Forums Feedback, OTW. If time is left,
                    he takes a look at some other forums as well. </p>
                    <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_bonezthegoon_avatar.jpg" short="BonezTheGoon" caption="BonezTheGoon"/>
                <p>
                    <e>BonezTheGoon</e> is a largely self taught "nerd" who studied at the
                    University of New Mexico. He enjoys cutting-edge hardware and describes building
                    a new machine as "the greatest rush to me in the computer industry". He games to
                    justify the cost of his cutting edge hardware. He attempted his first Gentoo
                    installation in mid-May of 2002 and had an installation that was actually
                    bootable in late May. He says he "had a LOT to learn when [he] started". Gentoo
                    was actually last on his list due to some misinformation he got on the web, so
                    he tried pretty much everything else first. He uses Gentoo primarily to
                    familiarize himself with GNU/Linux and "the wonderful world of Open Source". He
                    became a moderator as a result of a constant and prolific presence in the
                    Forums. His favorite is the Gamers forum.</p>
                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_deathwing00.jpg" short="Ioannis Aslanidis" caption="Ioannis Aslanidis"/>
                <p>
                    <e>Ioannis Aslanidis (Deathwing00)</e> got in touch with Gentoo in Easter of
                    2003, after hearing people at his University evangelize about how cool and
                    personalizable Gentoo is. He currently works for the <uri
                        link="http://www.etse.urv.es/recerca/banzai/">Banzai Research Group on
                        Artificial Intelligence</uri> where he'll stay and get his PhD. He became
                    moderator of the Greek forum when it was created in the Fall of 2004, by virtue
                    of having proposed it. Months later, he also began moderating the 'News
                    &amp; Announcements' forum as he liked the idea of posting GLSAs as fast as
                    possible in order to have forum visitors up-to-date in security matters. About a
                    month later he became a global moderator. His favorite forums (aside from the
                    Greek language one) are Installing Gentoo, Kernel &amp; Hardware and Portage
                    &amp; Programming. He also takes care of the organization of the as yet
                    unofficial translation of Gentoo documentation into Greek and the <uri
                        link="http://hellenicgentoo.sf.net">Hellenic Gentoo</uri> site.</p>
                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_erichsu.jpg" short="Eric Hsu" caption="Eric Hsu"/>
                <p>
                    <e>Eric Hsu (EricHsu)</e> used to be a user of Redhat/Fedora Core, until in the
                    beginning of the year 2004 a friend showed him how cool Gentoo Linux could be.
                    Since then he has never looked back, even having converted his sister and
                    parents to use of the distro. His favourite forum is the Chinese forum, followed
                    by Desktop Environments, and Multimedia - but he visits all of them. A great
                    place for sharing the excitement of Gentoo!". He does whatever he can do to push
                    Gentoo in China, including taking it upon himself to translate the Gentoo
                    Handbook (x86) into a Simplified Chinese version.</p>
                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_fedeliallalinea.jpg" short="Marco Genasci" caption="Marco Genasci"/>
                <p>
                    <e>Marco Genasci (fedeliallalinea)</e> started using Gentoo 3 years ago, because
                    of the advice and installation assistance of a friend of his. He loved it from
                    the beginning and tries to use Gentoo for everything and everywhere. His
                    favourite forum is obviously the Italian one, but he often visits
                    "Documentation, Tips &amp; Tricks" to brush up on useful tips and scripts.
                    He also helps in developing and updating the <uri
                        link="www.gentoo-italia.net">Gentoo Italian website </uri>. He is a member
                    of <uri link="http://www.gechi.it">GeChI</uri> (Gentoo CHannel Italian), a
                    Gentoo users group for the area Italy and the Italian part of Switzerland.</p>
                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_ian.jpg" short="Christian Hartmann" caption="Christian Hartmann"/>
                <p>
                    <e>Christian Hartmann (ian!)</e> heard about Gentoo in late 2003 while 
		    searching for a replacement of SuSE Linux for server environments. He 
		    was working as a coder at the time. After installing and playing around 
		    with Gentoo Linux on several machines he became addicted to it, and created 
		    his Forum account in early 2003. The great support community and the fun of 
		    helping others let his postcount rise steeply, leading to his becoming a 
		    moderator in the German forum first, in September 2003. "I'm a community guy." says
		    ian!, who together with many other developers from Germany founded the 'Friends of
		    Gentoo e.V.', the not-for-profit association promoting the use of Gentoo
		    in Germany. He was made a global moderator a little later in 2003 and became one of the
		    forum's administrators in April 2004,is part of the Gentoo Infrastructure project team
		    and (partially) responsible for the phpBB installation running the Forums. He's 
		    using Gentoo for his desktop and the servers at work, and for private use, of course. 
		    Outside of the Forums he's equally busy supporting Gentoo in many ways, not the least 
		    important being his contributions to the GWN in the past few months. He was the booth
		    coordinator at LWE 2004 (Frankfurt) after helping out at every single exhibition, conference
		    or trade fair last year that he could make it to, and you definitely want to check out some 
		    of his artwork for labels of last year's FOSDEM, Linuxtag, and LWE special Gentoo LiveCD 
		    editions.

                <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_kallamej.jpg" short="Anders Hellgren" caption="Anders Hellgren"/>
                <p>
                    <e>Anders Hellgren (kallamej)</e> first came into contact with Gentoo when he
                    got a new computer in May 2003. He had originally planned to dual boot Linux and
                    Windows, but as he only had NT4 available. Since NT4 doesn't like to be
                    installed on large partitions, the computer became Gentoo only. In July 2004 he
                    became a global moderator, largely because he had been quite active reporting
                    duplicates so that the admins and the rest of the mods thought he might as well
                    take care of it by himself. Frequently Asked Questions and Portage &amp;
                    Programming are Anders' favourite forums.</p>
                    <figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_mikessu_avatar.jpg" short="mikessu" caption="mikessu"/>
                <p>
                    <e>Mikko Yliniemi (mikessu)</e> got interested in Gentoo when he heard about it
                    from IRC. He was told about portage and the helpful community so he decided to
                    give it a try. Now he uses Gentoo at home for his personal use. He became a
                    Finnish forum moderator in the middle of 2004. His favourite forums are the
                    Multimedia forum and of course the Finnish forum. </p>
                <p>
                    <e>Krzysiek Pawlik (Nelchael)</e> settled happily on Gentoo after a friend's
                    demonstration. He uses Gentoo on his workstations as well as on servers and for
                    playing around. In December of 2004 another Polish forum moderator was needed -
                    Krzysiek was suggested by the other mods and was added to the moderator group a
                    few days later. His favourite forums are the Polish ones, but he occasionally
                    visits Networking &amp; Security and Portage &amp; Programming. He
                    sometimes contributes ebuilds to Gentoo, and one of Nelchael's OSS projects is
                    on its way into portage (<uri
                        link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68953">Bug #68953</uri>).</p>

                <p>
                    <e>Kyle Manna (Nitro)</e> is currently a freshman at University of Wisconsin
                    Madison. He is majoring in Electrical Computer Engineering and in his free time
                    he likes to work on his car. He got involved with Gentoo around release
                    candidate #6 of the 1.0 release. Ended up starting a forum on his home webserver
                    and I think we all know what happened with that. He mostly uses Gentoo in server
                    applications. Nitro has been a Moderator and Site Admin since the beginning as
                    he started the forums. His favourite forums are Networking &amp; Security as
                    well as Documentations, Tips &amp; Tricks. Originally he was the sole forum
                    administrator, but that changed quickly as other admins came onboard to help.
                    After the forums started to get big he became a developer as well and worked on
                    some networking ebuilds.</p>

                    <e>Mauricio Lima Pilla (Pilla)</e> received his PhD Degree in Computer Sciences
                    from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) last June, and is
                    still working there in the <uri link="http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/clumssy/">Clumssy
                    Project</uri> (HP/UFRGS) as well as lecturing in the CS Department. His previous
                    appointments included an internship in the University of Pittsburgh. After using
                    Debian, Red Hat and Conectiva, he was looking for a distribution which was easy
                    to update and also give total control to the user. He gave Gentoo a try and fell
                    in love with it. He joined the "terrific" forums in August 2002 and spends
                    considerable time in OTW and Gentoo Chat, but his Forums of choice are Desktop
                    Environments and Kernel &amp; Hardware.</p>

                    <e>Fabrizio Masia (randomaze)</e> was born in Sardinia 35 years ago. He studied
                    at the University of Pisa and now works in Milano as technical adviser. He
                    learned about Gentoo in 2003. He enjoys browsing Documentation, Tips &amp;
                    Tricks and moderating the Italian forum. He is also a member of <uri

                    specialist in Public Administration, taking care of networks and security. He
                    discovered Gentoo approximately two years ago, while surfing the web looking for
                    a new distribution that could satisfy his requirements. He became a prolific
                    poster to the fourms, and was proposed as a moderator after a few months. He
                    considers Gentoo the only true and valid alternative to MacOS X. He has
                    collaborated with the translation of Gentoo documentation, and took part in the
                    foundation of <uri link="http://www.gechi.it">GeChI</uri> (GEntoo CHannel
                    Italian) of which he is President.</p>

                    <e>Tom Knight (tomk)</e> has been using Gentoo since September 2003, after
                    discovering that he needed more than what OBSD on the Desktop could offer. He
                    originally used Gentoo for personal work, but now he runs it on his servers, at
                    work and for his development work. Tom joined the forums at the same time and
                    became a moderator at the end of March 2004. He spends a lot of time in Portage
                    &amp; Programming, as he is a programmer. He is also a Gentoo developer,
                    part of the net-mail herd and maintainer of the Joe's Own Editor (joe) ebuilds.</p>

                    <e>Erik Ekman (Yarrick)</e> started using Gentoo the summer of 2002, after
                    checking out the options for running Linux full-time. He uses it on his personal
                    all-in-one box at home, and on almost every box when he can and is allowed to.
                    He was around at the time when the Scandinavian forums started, and volunteered
                    for to moderate them - he says that "the users behave, so it's not hard work."
                    Erik says that the Documentation, Tips &amp;Tricks forum brings him lot of
                    valuable advice. He also enjoys the Gentoo Chat forum.</p>

<p><b>Rsync-ing selectively</b></p>
<p>
People with low-bandwidth connections may be interested in our 
first thread selection in this issue! Is it possible to rsync 
only parts of the Portage tree?  What are some of the conditions 
under which you would prefer to do so?  Read this thread for the 
pros and cons of doing so.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Excluding package updates</b></p>
<p>
In light of our first topic this week, we bring you another 
Portage-related thread.  Occasionally a package that you do not 
necessarily want to update will become available in the Portage tree.  
PHP5 is one example, Apache2 is another.  VMWare 5 is the one given 
in this thread.  What Portage options are available to consider what 
you already have as up-to-date so one can "emerge -u world" without 
worry?  Read on!</p>

<title>Japan: GentooJP Bounenkai report and photos</title> 
<body>
<p>The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.gr.jp">GentooJP</uri> year-end party
was held in the Shibuya district of Tokyo on 28 December 2004. Twelve Japanese
Gentooists from all Japan joined in the fun, had many drinks, laughed and smiled 
a lot, and discussed in all seriousness the planned publication of the second (!)
Gentoo book. Even <mail link="nakano@gentoo.org">Masatomo Nakano</mail>, one of Japan's
most active Gentoo developers, could attend the Bounenkai during his brief visit 
from London where he currently lives.</p>

<figure link="/images/gwn/20050103_gentoojp.jpg" short="GentooJP" caption="The Bounenkai crowd in a Shibuya pub, complexions not entirely void of beverage influence"/>

<p>2004 was an exceptional year for the Japanese Gentoo community, with a number of 
featured Gentoo articles in Linux magazines, thanks to Nakano and Mamoru Komachi 
(see below). 2004 also saw the first Gentoo book <uri 
link="http://www.sbpnet.jp/books/products/detail.asp?sku=4797324945">"My first Gentoo"</uri> 
by Softbank Publishing, many translation improvements including the latest Gentoo 
Handbook, and the Japanese GWN translator team being back in business and on track 
with timely deliveries of the weekly newsletter. As people gradually understand what 
the benefits from a source-based distribution are, expectations for Gentoo to gain 
even more popularity in Japan in 2005 are high among the Japanese Gentooists.</p>

<p>Two articles in a series written by Gentoo developer <mail

Management in Gentoo." What started in the December issue of Software Design is
continued in the current January number available at newsstands in Japan: a description 
of Portage using practical examples, helpful tips and tools not only for Portage newbies, 
but also for weathered admins just recently migrating from other distros. The article
focusses especially on detailed explanations of new features in Portage version 2.0.51,
to further boost people's awareness of Gentoo in Japan.</p>
