<title>Genesi starts shipping PegasosPPC with Gentoo Linux preinstalled</title>
<body>
<p>The Luxemburg-based company <uri link="http://www.genesi.lu">Genesi S.à.r.l.</uri> has announced that sales of their PegasosPPC Open Desktop Workstations (ODW) equipped with Gentoo Linux 2004.3 will start this week. Just hours after ordering of the ODW had become "quietly" available on the Freescale (i.e. the CPU manufacturer's) <uri link="https://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?nodeId=018rH3bTdG8653&amp;code=PPCG40001">website</uri> on Thanksgiving Day, orders started pouring in, says Bill Buck, Genesi's CEO. The units are to be shipped to South Korea and will be the first to sport Gentoo Linux, on top of the previously included Debian and Yellowdog. </p>

           caption="Fan-less assembled Pegasos II motherboard" />
<p>According to Genesi, the PowerPC-based ODW offers "an anchor for the whole enterprise infrastructure." Optimized performance and lower price levels are the prime objectives, offering a solution to collapse the IT infrastructure into one family of scalable and upgradable hardware, and an open-source operating system and application base. "We think there will be a lot of interest in this concept, especially for national IT infrastructures where a progressively developing software resource based on GNU/Linux can significantly reduce the total cost of ownership," says Bill Buck. He wants a low-foot-print, low-power 32bit PowerPC solution "with a strong link to Gentoo and other non-commercial GNU/Linux distributions as a foundation." Genesi and Freescale foster development on their current Open Desktop Workstations, with the next hardware generation being tuned to market: The PegasosPPCs donated last month to Gentoo Linux and other developers are predominantly positioned as development machines, but they can serve as thin clients, workstation, netcom devices, file servers or clusters alike.</p>

<p>Amidst MySQL servers and efforts at building Pegasos blade clusters, Gentoo developer <mail link="dholm@gentoo.org">David Holm</mail> and colleagues have been working on a Linux/PPC-based network firewall and mail filter application running on the Pegasos hardware. By utilising AltiVec to do parallel processing of data they hope to increase the maximum throughput of both network packets and e-mails. Developers at the Romanian subsidiary of <uri link="http://www.freescale.com">Freescale</uri>  are integrating their AltiVec enhanced VPN enciphering modules with this product. The base system is built by using the Gentoo uclibc stages in order to minimise the footprint so that it will fit on flash storage. Parts of the code developed for this project will be released as (L)GPL, the systems are scheduled to ship in early 2005.</p>

<title>Gentoo script repository</title>
<body>
<p>As the script-aided administration of Gentoo systems is clearly a very useful concept, the idea of a central script repository had already been formalized in an early <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0015.html">Gentoo Linux Enhancement Proposal (GLEP)</uri>. Lack of manpower has prevented this from finishing yet, but Gentoo developer Patrick Lauer now offers <uri link="http://gentooexperimental.org/scripts/">a provisional repository</uri>, awaiting integration into the official collection when GLEP #15 is finally implemented. This space is open to all users, not just official developers. For the time being, if you want to contribute, send your script(s) with a short description (and in case they are not in the public domain, some license information attached to it) directly to <mail link="patrick@gentoo.org">Patrick</mail>.

<body>
<p>With the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.gr.jp/jpnews/main/20041128-GentooHandbook-x86.xml">announcement of the Japanese translator team</uri> that their version of the Gentoo Handbook for x86 now reflects all changes done for the 2004.3 release, there are currently six alternative languages available with a mostly or even completely up-to-date translation of the English default handbook. While the German version had already been in sync with the English documentation since the day of the release, Danish, French, Spanish and traditional Chinese have been added over the course of the last two weeks. Other languages are bound to follow, and you can speed up things by helping the translation teams in your language: contact the project leads <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp/international.xml">listed here</uri> if you would like to contribute your time.

<title>Shifting to 2.6 kernel as default</title>
<body>
<p>Traditionally, our installation documentation has instructed users to install a Linux 2.4 kernel to power their Gentoo installation. Linux 2.4 is now in maintenance mode and has been superseded by Linux 2.6.</p>

<p>Linux 2.6, initially released at the end of 2003, is the result of years of rapid development, providing many new features and improvements. Notable changes include much improved desktop interactivity, multimedia improvements such as new sound drivers (ALSA), improved hardware and architecture support, additional security capabilities, improved multi-processor (SMP) efficiency, and many other changes. Linux 2.6 is still under constant development and has now reached a mature stage.</p>

<p>Gentoo Linux has always provided and semi-supported Linux 2.6 for an option for users, and a few architectures have recently moved to making this their recommended kernel (ppc, ppc64, amd64, ia64). For other architectures such as x86, the default supported kernel is still Linux 2.4. For the 2005.0 release, the Gentoo kernel developers are working to make Linux 2.6 the default kernel for all supported architectures upon which 2.6 runs well. All new installations will run Linux 2.6, and at time of 
release, existing 2.4 users will be encouraged to migrate.</p>

<p>Preparation for this switch has already begun. Our 2004.3 LiveCD, unlike previous releases, runs the Linux 2.6 kernel internally by default, and feedback from this has been very positive. Our Gentoo-supported Linux 2.6 package, gentoo-dev-sources, has been extended to be supported by as many 
architectures as possible, whereas its 2.4 predecessor (gentoo-sources) is really only aimed at x86 users. Thankfully, the process of migration from Linux 2.4 to 2.6 is relatively simple, but documentation is in development to <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/migration-to-2.6.xml">highlight caveats in the migration</uri>.</p>

<p>For the 2005.0 release, the 2.6-based gentoo-dev-sources package will be merged into gentoo-sources. Other kernel packages will undergo similar operations (e.g. development-sources merging into vanilla-sources), and the 2.6 releases will be the default kernels under these package titles. Linux 2.4 will still be supported, and will be selectable through an alternative Portage profile. We have some more work to do beforehand, but we will provide complete documentation when this change settles into place.</p>

<p><b>Gentoo on low end systems</b></p>
<p>Gentoo is primarily installed on modern hardware because it demands CPU power when doing most Portage operations. However, Gentoo's "only what you need" approach is great for systems that only need a select set of services running, or machines with meager hardware available.  Check out this quick thread for a few tips if you're planning on installing Gentoo on an aging machine.</p>

<p>
Here's a quick tip that we've mentioned before; but can be such a time saver that it is worth bringing up every so often. When upgrading Linux kernels, use the command stated in this thread to carry over the settings from your previous kernel version.</p>

<title>Turkey: New Gentoo website, GWN mailing list</title>
<body>

<p>Gentoo Türkiye, the Turkish Gentoo User Group, has announced their soon-to-be <uri link="http://www.gentoo-tr.org/">website</uri>, still very much under construction at the time of this writing. According to admin Bahadır Kandemir (who is doubling as lead GWN translator for Turkish), the team running the site is working on their own XML content management system, and will go live as soon as possible. More importantly, the revived Turkish GWN version can now be subscribed to, via a brandnew mailing list "bulten@gentoo-tr.org" (bulten = newsletter), operational only since last week. If you would like to receive the Turkish GWN regularly (with a delay of just a few hours compared to the English original), send an empty mail to <mail link="bulten-subscribe@gentoo-tr.org">bulten-subscribe@gentoo-tr.org</mail>. Interestingly enough, Gentoo Türkiye's website and mailing list are sponsored by a Moscow-based hosting company, <uri link="http://www.iqchoice.com">IQChoice.com</uri>. In case you'd like to support their efforts, come and meet the Turkish Gentoo user community where they usually hang out: in the <path>#turklug</path> channel on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<title>Poland: Bialystok EVDT conference</title>
<body>

<p>Last Saturday, 20 November 2004, a group of open-source amateurs using the colorful label "Electric Vodka Developer Team" (EVDT) held a conference on <uri link="http://szarik.rr.nu/evdt/alt04.html">"Alternative platforms and operating systems"</uri> in their home town Bialystok, an all-day event hosted at the local Technical University. Papers on the history of operating systems, on cluster, embedded, and real time systems, and about the differences between x86 and PowerPC architectures were being presented to about 80 participants. The PPC side was further explored in talks about the Altivec units in PowerPC G4 processors and how to make use of them with the help of gcc, and in a closing presentation about the PegasosPPC platform (see above) and its native MorphOS system. Between the sessions and after the last one had finished, visitors were able to see and touch some live hardware and software. There were PowerPC (G3 and G4) with MorphOS on display, and x86 desktops with QNX, Slackware, Debian, and of course Gentoo Linux installed. Everyone was free to check the differences between several Linux flairs, alternative operating systems, and assorted hardware. Some photos and a longer report from the event are available <uri link="http://szarik.rr.nu/evdt/alt04.html">here</uri> (polish only).

<title>Tips and Tricks</title>

<title>Portage GUIs</title>
<body>

<p>Larry the Cow became just a bit frustrated with Portage and its textual frontend. There used to be the legendary <c>KPortage</c> to sooth his craving for a graphical user interface, but its development stalled, and it vanished from the Portage tree a long time ago. </p>
<p>Then Larry tried <c>guitoo</c> and <c>porthole</c>. He was impressed. He found two up-to-date Portage frontends with ongoing development. All of a sudden, Larry the Cow was in control. And he liked it.
</p>

<p>First off, <uri link="http://guitoo.sf.net">Guitoo</uri> is a KDE application offering most functions 
of Portage, such as views of installed and generally available packages. It helps you keep your system up to date, lets you view logs and keeps its own queue for the installation of multiple packages. Very interesting and rather more advanced than its predecessor KPortage it's equipped with a systemtray ("kicker") application called Gentoo Watcher, which is pulling in <c>rss</c> feeds from the Gentoo website, raking in all available information on the latest packages and the Gentoo Linux Security Advisories (GLSA). Using the watcher, pending security updates are just one click away as they can be pushed to Guitoo for emerging.</p> 
<pre caption="Emerge Guitoo">
# echo "app-portage/guitoo ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords <comment>(if necessary)</comment>
# emerge guitoo
</pre>

<p>And then there's <uri link="http://porthole.sf.net/">Porthole</uri>. GTK+-2 rather than Qt-based, it gives you control over the basic Portage features, i.e. <c>emerge</c>, <c>unmerge</c>, <c>sync</c> and <c>update</c>. While <c>guitoo</c> only gets the output of <c>emerge --pretend</c> to show you the dependencies a package has, <c>porthole</c> can show you directly which dependencies are met and which are not. </p>
<pre caption="Emerge Porthole">
# echo "app-portage/porthole ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords <comment>(if necessary)</comment>
# emerge porthole
</pre>
<p>Larry, being happy about having the tools in the first place, is rather indifferent at this point as to which one is preferrable. He suggests you try both, and decide for yourself. Choice to the user. </p>
