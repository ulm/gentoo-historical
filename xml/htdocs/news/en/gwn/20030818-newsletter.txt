Gentoo migrates to a more robust DNS infrastructure
---------------------------------------------------
  
Recently, Gentoo Technologies switched from running in-house DNS servers 
to using outsourced DNS service powered by UltraDNS[1]. This new 
outsourcing relationship offers Gentoo a more reliable, scalable DNS 
infrastructure and allows us to spend more time developing Gentoo Linux 
and less time administering infrastructure servers. 

 1. http://www.ultradns.com
 
In addition, UltraDNS offers us several new features and capabilities 
previously unavailable in our BIND name server environment. These features 
include SiteBacker[2] and DirectionalDNS[3]. Gentoo is currently using 
SiteBacker to ensure that users are always able to access 
www.gentoo.org[4], which currently comprises four servers. When one server 
goes down, such as for planned maintenance, SiteBacker automatically 
redirects client requests to one of the other three servers, minimizing 
disruptions to our users.

 4. http://www.gentoo.org
 
Gentoo is also currently experimenting with DirectionalDNS as a means of 
offering targeted responses to DNS queries for rsync.gentoo.org. Based 
upon the success of this test, we will be looking to expand the use of 
DirectionalDNS to other domains as well. 
 
UltraDNS servers currently respond to nearly 5 million Gentoo-related DNS 
queries per month, and their service and support have been exceptional 
throughout. We'd like to take this opportunity to thank UltraDNS for their 
support of the Gentoo Linux project.

Gentoo Linux developer Kevyn Shortell[5] has put up more photos from Linux 
World Expo 2003 here[6] on his site, as well as letting us know that the 
PPC team had a PowerMac G4, an iBook and a Total Impact Briq, not an iBook 
and a PowerMac G3, as we said in last week's newsletter. At time of 
writing, Kevyn hasn't yet put up captions or thumbnails or captions, and 
the page is 11MB including images, so surf on down there at your own risk. 
:-) Thanks to Kevyn for putting up the photos and pointing out the error.

GLSA: gentoo-sources
--------------------
  
Quote from advisory: 
 
"The route cache implementation in Linux 2.4, and the Netfilter IP 
conntrack module, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service 
(CPU consumption) via packets with forged source addresses that cause a 
large number of hash table collisions." 
 
"The ioperm system call in Linux kernel 2.4.20 and earlier does not 
properly restrict privileges, which allows local users to gain read or 
write access to certain I/O ports." 
 
"A race condition in the way env_start and env_end pointers are 
initialized in the execve system call and used in fs/proc/base.c on Linux 
2.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash)."
 
 * Severity: Critical - multiple vulnerabilities. 
 * Packages Affected: <gentoo-sources-2.4.20-r6 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge gentoo-sources; emerge clean. After 
that, compile, install and reboot your computer to complete the upgrade. 
 * GLSA Announcement[7] 
 7. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-announce&m=106086565405212&w=2

    
GLSA: semi
----------
  
"The (1) semi MIME library 1.14.5 and earlier, and (2) wemi 1.14.0 and 
possibly other versions, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files 
via a symlink attack on temporary files."
 
 * Severity: Medium - insecure temporary files creation. 
 * Packages Affected: <semi-1.14.5-r1 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge semi, emerge clean. 
 * GLSA Announcement[8]

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Nick Hadaway
 
Figure 4.1: Nick Hadaway
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20030818_raker.jpg
 
This week, we are featuring Nick Hadaway[12] (raker), a very active and 
prolific developer. Nick started working on Gentoo in early 2002, 
initially taking responsibility for maintaining most of the packages in 
/net-mail, and a few other packages. He has now expanded that role into 
work with /media-*, /net-ftp, Windowmaker and LDAP packages. Apart from 
the usual dev duties of maintaining ebuilds, Nick contributes C and C++ 
code patches and testing. He perceives his primary role as dealing with 
bugs by "listening to what users want and mak[ing] their wish a reality", 
if he can.

 12. raker@gentoo.org
 
Some years ago, Nick began working on his own Linux source-based distro 
(Give Me Some Linux). His idea will sound familiar: using shell-scripts 
and higher-level languages to automate package installation from source. 
Upon discovering Gentoo, Nick abandoned the increasingly complex task of 
maintaining his distro, because "Gentoo filled [his] every desire", and 
because of his delight in its distinction from Red Hat. He promptly made a 
point to begin contributing to the Gentoo project. Over the past two 
years, Nick has earned the respect of his peers as an effective and able 
contributer.
 
Nick works as a computer consultant in Chicago, and occasionally 
moonlights as a manager/jack-of-all-trades for his mother's restaurant 
near Milwaukee. He has an additional night job as a rock musician in 
Madison, WI. He currently is in the process of maintaining or establishing 
residences in all three cities. He studied Electrical Engineering and 
Music Performance at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and has taken 
Computer Science courses at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.
 
When not patching bugs or dealing with pizza (insert obligatory Hiro 
Protagonist reference here), he is usually creating music. He plays 
trumpet, bass and drums - even contributing vocals. He enjoys hard-core 
and "real techno" and was active in the rave scene when it was a little 
more current. He enjoys clubs and parties and will often travel a fair 
distance to attend a significant one. 
 
Nick uses an aging PII-450 at home, and a variety of boxen in other 
places. The first app he launches is the appropriately retro "xterm -bg 
black -fg green". He uses Windowmaker as his WM, and Pine or SquirrelMail 
for mail. He concluded our interview by reminding us that "Gentoo is ... 
FNORD!".

Gentoo Forums Now With Italian User Interface
 
Forum moderatrice Brandy[13] announced on Thursday that Italian has been 
added as an interface language for the Gentoo Forums. Besides English and 
now Italian, available board languages include Dutch, French, German, 
Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. Users who wish to see the menu 
texts in their native language can switch the default in their profile[14].

Yet Another Portage Debate
 
There were times when the Forums went weeks without someone asking why 
Portage isn't rewritten in C++, but this week was clearly not one of them. 
Check this thread for an assessment of this and other proposed variations 
to Gentoo's package management technology:

Xvnc Terminal Server Installation Guide, Diskless Gentoo Installation
 
On occasion, tutorials about things that are not yet covered by the 
general documentation are being donated by Forum users. This week 
lines[17] explains the procedure for setting up a VNC server that 
automatically spawns sessions when someone is connecting to it, a clever 
way to prevent having to start a new VNC server for each user. 
Contributions like that can lead to more than just 15 minutes of fame: 
Another installation guide posted by Swiss.Mage[18] back in June, this one 
talking about a diskless Gentoo installation, must have been so convincing 
that it ascended to be a chapter of the official Alternative Install Guide 
last week:

Disabling Anti-Aliasing in Evolution 
 
For many XFree86 Linux users, the benefits of anti-aliasing often come 
down to personal preference. Some like it, some do not. Unfortuantely, 
there's still not a global method of controlling AA in X due to the 
modular structure of Linux in general. Some gentoo-user contributors 
offered some creative and clever solutions in this  post [22] that could 
be used elsewhere as well.

Gentoo user a_k_b was having problems using a Linux VGA framebuffer 
console along with Nvidia's accelerated XFree86 drivers. The thread that

Donations to Gentoo 
 
Donating to the Gentoo project is a great way to help our favorite distro 
get even better. Gentoo-user list member Tom Wesley posted a simple 
question asking where the donations "go". It may have not been the most 
liked thread on the list this week, but it was definitely the largest.

Canada: Adelie Linux - Gentoo Single System Image Project
 
A little sidelined by other news surrounding Gentoo's Linuxworld Expo 
(LWE) involvement two weeks ago, the Gentoo Cluster Project certainly 
deserves more attention. After all, the remote cluster system that showed 
graphics rendering with a parallel version of POVRAY at the booth in San 
Francisco was proof for an exceptionally well done collaboration between 
academics, corporate backers and Gentoo developers: The driving force 
behind it all is an initiative known as Adelie Linux[25], part of the 
University of Montreal's Center for Research on Computation and its 
Applications (CERCA[26]), an institute specializing in parallel and 
distributed multi-processor systems. When CERCA's High Performance 
Computing Group needed an environment for their own Beowulf systems, they 
chose Gentoo Linux "because it is a young, innovative, and very well 
designed distribution that give their users a great deal of flexibility, a 
clear upgrade path and a very high level of hardware optimization, which 
makes it especially attractive for all kind of high performance 
applications". A local IT-solutions firm, Cyberlogic[27], joined CERCA in 
conducting the Single System Image project that is now fully operational, 
running on the university's own and an external industrial Beowulf[28]. 
According to Cyberlogic, the Adelie/SSI cluster management system allows 
for a centralization of all operations on the server, providing a single 
point of control for the whole distributed environment, offering a 
performance increase of up to 30%, easier administration and expansion, 
fast bootup and enhanced robustness. Cyberlogic's complete cluster 
solutions, based on Gentoo and Adelie, are available with processors 
ranging from Xeon and Pentium 4 to Athlon MP/XP, and - thanks to Olivier 
Crête[29]'s AMD 64 port of Gentoo - even Opteron CPUs.

Germany: Interview with Gentoo PPC Lead Developer Pieter van den Abeele
 
The German online Linux magazine PPCNUX (obviously focusing on Linux for 
the Macintosh platform) has conducted an interview with Pieter van den 
Abeele, lead developer for Gentoo PPC. Pieter describes his involvement in 
producing a Gentoo LiveCD aiming for bootability on every single Macintosh 
out there, and has a lot to say about how Gentoo differentiates from other 
Linuces for the PowerPC, about the MetaPkg project[30] porting Portage to 
Mac OS X and other aspects of Gentoo Linux development for the most 
popular non-x86 platform. Difficult to overlook is also his call for help: 
developers who would like to offer time, expertise and possibly hardware 
to expand Gentoo PPC to hardware from Eyetech (AmigaOne), Genesi 
(PegasosPPC), IBM (RS/6000) and oldworld Macintoshs should contact him 
right away[31]. No need to be afraid to click on the link to the magazine 
if you don't speak German, by the way: They decided to publish the 
interview[32] in English.

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Creating ScreenShots with import 
 
This week's tip shows you how to take screenshots of your desktop or 
individual windows using the import command. import is provided by 
ImageMagick so you'll need to install it from portage. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.1:                                                       |
| Getting ImageMagick                                                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# emerge media-gfx/imagemagick                                           |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now that ImageMagick is installed, you can use it to take screenshots of 
either your entire desktop, parts of it, or just individual windows. 
First, let's look at taking a screenshot of your entire desktop and saving 
it as the file desktop.png. 
 
Note:  To use other image formats such as jpg, simply specify that file 
extension and import will create it in that format (i.e. desktop.jpg). 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.2:                                                       |
| Desktop Screenshot                                                      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|% import -window root desktop.png                                        |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Next we'll look at taking a screenshot of just one window. To do this, use 
the import command and click on the window you want to capture. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.3:                                                       |
| Window Screenshot                                                       |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|First, specify the file to save                                          |
|% import gvim.png                                                        |
|Now click on your gvim window to take the screenshot                     |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This should get you started but there are many other things you can do 
with import and ImageMagick. To see a list of the many options that can be 
passed to import, see the man page (man 1 import).
