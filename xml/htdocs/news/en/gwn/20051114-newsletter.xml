<title>Switched to stage3 as the default installation method</title>
<body>
<p>
During the last week the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp/index.xml">Gentoo Documentation
Project</uri> changed the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/index.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>
in a way, that the installation of a stage3 will be default.  Prior to this
change the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/index.xml">Release
Engineering team</uri> asked for the change, as the number of users increased,
who messed up their base-system due to unrecommended changes during a stage1 or
stage2 install or not following the handbook completely.
</p>
<p>
The adviced method now is to do a stage3 installation and optionally recompile
the system after the installation.  That will create an optimized system as
well.  How to proceed a real stage1 or stage2 installation is still described in
the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">FAQ</uri>.
</p>
<p>
For further reading you can have a look at the <uri
link="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.documentation/2327">full
discussion</uri> about the change on the gentoo-doc mailing list, see the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xml/htdocs/doc/en/handbook/hb-install-x86-medium.xml?hidecvsroot=1&amp;search=&amp;hideattic=0&amp;sortby=file&amp;r2=1.41&amp;logsort=date&amp;root=gentoo&amp;diff_format=h&amp;r1=1.40">real

<title>Interview with Douglas Robertson from Zymeta Corporation</title>
<body>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20051114_zymeta-jukebox.jpg" short="Zymeta Video
  Jukebox"
caption="The Zymeta Video Jukebox in action" />

<p><e>A few words about you. Who are you, where do you work?</e></p>

<p>My name is Douglas Robertson and I'm the Director of Technology at <uri
  link="http://www.zymeta.com/">Zymeta Entertainment.</uri></p>

<p><e>What is your "product"?</e></p>

<p>Zymeta is an entertainment systems company. We have developed an on demand
  touch screen media delivery platform for public venues complete with a backend
  system for updating and managing the platform. And we can manage the platform
  as a whole or make changes for a single location.  Our first very successful
  product is a music video entertainment system called the "Video Jukebox" which
  is typically installed in pubs and bars.  The venues patrons are able to
  choose their music selections using a touchscreen and then watch the music
  videos on the bars televisions and advertisers can pin point their promotions
  to specific locations or groups of locations.   The service is completely
  licensed by the music industry.   It's flashy, it's interactive and it's built
  on top of Gentoo Linux.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to see the jukebox in action, our <uri
    link="http://www.zymeta.com/files/corporate-video-small.mov">corporate
    video</uri> also has a lot of cool shots.</p>

<p><e>How does Gentoo fit in there? Why did you decide to use it?</e></p>

<p>As far as technology is concerned, Zymeta is a Gentoo-driven company.  The
  development team all run Gentoo on their desktops, our servers are all running
  Gentoo and, most importantly, our jukeboxes all run Gentoo.   I brought Gentoo
  into Zymeta and mandated it be the distro used; trying to support multiple
  distributions is too much hassle. I chose Gentoo because of it's flexibility;
  it's a source-based distro with a great packaging system and a great
  user-base.</p>

<p>We update the jukebox client software over the Internet but we haven't been
  updating the Operating System on the jukeboxes. We haven't updated the OS
  because Gentoo has been so stable and as such there's been no real need to
  change anything.  We looked at setting up our own portage tree but decided
  that the best route to any major updates would be to build a new tarball of
  the OS and use that to update the jukeboxes. In the future we may look at
  doing minor updates of individual packages using a portage tree. This would
  allow us to keep the jukeboxes up to date in case of any security flaws
  found.</p>

<p>That said, we recently upgraded the software so that it works flawlessly on
  the 2.6 kernel and I have spent the last two days setting up a CD that boots
  the jukebox, mounts the hard drive and then updates the OS files.  The Gentoo
  community was very helpful with this, and as I mentioned, there is a tonne of
  documentation, which make it simple for me to modify the Gentoo 2005.1 LiveCD
  so that it is Zymeta branded and does the required updating.</p>

<p><e>What did Gentoo replace?</e></p>

<p>Prior to Gentoo, Zymeta was running Red Hat for servers and Debian on the
  jukeboxes.</p>

<p><e>Any experiences with other distributions? How do they compare?</e></p>

<p>I initially tried Gentoo in 2003 at my previous job because a co-worker
  decided to try it and then complained about how much trouble it was to set up
  and how it took him two days to get it working.  To prove him wrong I tried it
  and had a working Gentoo, complete with KDE, on my Dell laptop within the day.
  It was love at first sight with Gentoo so I never went back to my old Red Hat
  install.</p>

<p>A lot of people had issues with Red Hat's RPM system, but I loved it.  At
  least until I started needing the latest packages of various things (such as
  PostgreSQL and some networking tools) and the RPM wouldn't work because it was
  built on a different version of Red Hat. Or it would require updating three
  other packages, which in turn had their own dependencies.  Gentoo's package
  system is the real shining star as far as I'm concerned, and while updates
  take longer since packages are compiled, it's well worth it.</p>

<p><e>What are the big advantages? Where does it shine?</e></p>

<p>Gentoo offers flexibility. Don't need IPv6 support is your packages?  Just
  change your USE flags. No ebuild for a package you need? Just create your own
  ebuild and add it into your Portage overlay. How sweet is that for
  flexibility?</p>

<p><e>What do you see as problematic? Where could things be improved?</e></p>

<p>My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a long time to stabilize
  packages. I like that the maintainers ensure that packages compile and work
  properly before marking a package as stable, especially given that we run
  Gentoo on production/enterprise systems, but sometimes it seems to take a bit
  too long. But we get around that using Portage's flexibility (ie. USE flags
  and Portage overlays).</p>


<p><e>There are many projects like the installer, Gentoo/Alt (BSD,...).  What do
    you think of this expansion into new fields? How about different
    architectures?</e></p>

<p>I think that the more people using Gentoo the better. Part of the reason I'm
  excited about this interview is that I want to help spread the word that
  Gentoo can be used in any environment, whether it's on a desktop or on an
  enterprise server running a mission-critical database. Stability is key in
  most environments but I don't think that you necessarily need to use six month
  old packages to get that stability.</p>

<p><e>How do you see the community? What is the general perception of Gentoo in
    your company?</e></p>

<p>I love the Gentoo community.  There's a lot of support available and tonnes
  of documentation. And because at this stage it seems like the majority of
  Gentoo users have a fairly technical background, there's a different feel to
  the Gentoo forums as compared to say the old Red Hat forums.</p>

<p>As for Zymeta, everyone in the company knows Zymeta's product is built on top
  of Gentoo. And since our switch to Gentoo, the stability of our product has
  increased. Part of that is due to Gentoo and part of that is due to an updated
  kernel. But the end result is that the Zymeta team and our customers associate
  Gentoo with stability.</p>

<p><e>How can you be contacted?  And what can we expect in the near future?</e></p>

<p>If anyone wants to talk to me about deploying Gentoo in the enterprise, they
  can contact me at dr@zymeta.com. Also, I believe that Gentoo developer Corey
  Shields wants to create a Gentoo case study out of Zymeta so people should
  look soon for that.</p>

<p>Oh, and there's a Gentoo easter egg in an upcoming version of the Zymeta
  Jukebox client so if anyone wants to know how to do that, they can email me
  about that too.</p>

<p><e>Thanks for the interview!</e></p>
