Gentoo Linux Enhancement Proposals
----------------------------------
  
Grant Goodyear recently announced[1] Gentoo Linux Enhancement Proposals 
(GLEPs), which are intended to track and manage large-scale proposals, 
such as the "Herds[2]" proposal. Based on Python's system of PEPs (Python 
Enhancement Proposals[3]) this system will help ensure large-scale 
proposals don't get lost in the shuffle. Grant's GLEP proposal is still in 
draft form and subject to revision based on feedback from the user and 
developer community.

bugs.gentoo.org gets a new home
-------------------------------
  
As mentioned earlier[4], Gentoo Linux is undergoing a number of 
infrastructure changes designed to accomodate the increased load on our 
infrastructure servers. One of these changes was completed last week with 
the successful migration of bugs.gentoo.org onto a new, dedicated server. 
This change not only gives bugs.gentoo.org additional capacity, but it 
also frees up additional headroom for forums.gentoo.org since previously, 
the two services were sharing a single server.

Rev. Jeffrey Paul, Gentoo Linux in production environments and much more
 
This week we feature Jeffrey Paul, aka sneak[7]. He's currently 20 years 
old and lives in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. sneak's one of the core 
organizers of RUBI-CON[8], a data and network security conference, held 
each spring in Detroit. He plans to present a speech at RC6 about the use 
of Gentoo Linux in a production environment, and hopes to have a chance to 
use Gentoo Hardened/SELinux in production by then to incorporate it into 
his speech. He also was investigated by the FBI for cracking UNIX 
computers overseas when he was 14, although nothing ever came of it. Since 
that time, he's been nearly 100% whitehat. Besides that Jeffrey is a 
reverend of the Universal Life Church[9], a freelance photographer taking 
pictures of local events and a DJ playing Detroit techno exclusively. To 
find out more about him visit his website[10].

Gentoo Linux in production environments
 
sneak's been a freelance IT consultant for five years. His focus is on 
stability and security, which is why he chose Gentoo Linux. One of his 
clients, a sales and marketing firm in Troy, Michigan relies heavily on 
Gentoo Linux. Their infrastructure exists primarily to support their 
office LAN and the WAN between their three locations. Their two servers 
running Gentoo are responsible for their internet connectivity via proxy 
(Squid), their next-generation database system (MySQL/PHP/Apache), their 
public website (MySQL/PHP/Apache), their files and collaboration (Samba 
and netatalk), their backups (OpenSSH/scp), and their email (postfix). 
Gentoo's speed and convenience, cheap commodity x86 hardware, and the 
flexibility of Linux allow to keep the entire office running smoothly with 
limited IT resources. With Portage, Jeffrey says, system administration 
takes about a tenth of the time it did before the switch to Gentoo.
 
Another one of his clients is an IT services and application development 
provider in Oak Park, Michigan. Their infrastructure exists for hosting 
their client's sites, both as a hosting provider and as a web application 
development company. A mix of NT servers (only because Exchange doesn't 
run on Linux and VBScript works better on NT) and Gentoo, he provides 
consulting regarding their datacenter network and administrates all of 
their currently 3 Gentoo Linux servers. There, Gentoo is used for 
everything that matters, namely DNS, DHCP, IDS, and mail. This services 
are provided by qmail, sqwebmail, and qmailadmin (on Apache) for most 
clients. They also run ISC BIND9, ISC dhcpd, and of course OpenSSH. The 
administration machine runs Nagios (formerly Netsaint), MRTG, and some 
other custom monitoring tools.
 
Lately Jeffrey has been getting away from consulting, trying to find 
full-time employment in IT in the Detroit area. If you feel like plugging 
his jobhunt, he certainly wouldn't mind.
 
datavibe.net and the Gentoo community at Livejournal
 
For four years now, sneak has run datavibe.net[11], a nonprofit freenet 
provider of UNIX services. It's not running Gentoo already because he's 
been waiting for some new hardware, but this will change pretty soon. The 
plan is to use Gentoo Hardened on datavibe.net as soon as it's production 
ready.

sneak also is co-maintainer of the Gentoo community at Livejournal[12], a 
resource he is pleased to advertise in the GWN.

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Rob Holland
 
Rob Holland[13] is a member of the sound@g.o team that looks after 
media-sound. He participates in ebuild bug fixing, testing, and committing 
ebuilds, taking special interest in the ardour-cvs, jack-cvs, and other 
Digital-Audio-Workstation things as he uses them a lot at home. It was 
actually through his work with the ardour-cvs ebuild that Rob became part 
of the Gentoo team: when he submitted a few updates for it, he got talking 
to Jon Ellis[14], one of the more experienced developers of the sound 
team, who somehow convinced Rob to do his work for him. (Rob wants to say 
"Meh!", to Jon, explaining that it'll no doubt get Jon giggling to himself 
as he often does.) Rob also maintains the GNUStep colection of ebuilds and 
WindowMaker stuff, as well as the keychain and cyrus-imapd ebuilds. He 
used to do a lot of work with OpenBSD - not as a developer there, but 
locally, building embedded systems out of it, and also has made a couple 
suggestions to Paul Davis, the maker of Ardour, some of which have been 
implemented. 

 13. robh@gentoo.org
 14. jje@gentoo.org
 
A Unix Systems Developer and Systems Admin (Rob prefers the first) at LINX 
by day, he also runs a Linux consultancy in his spare time("spare 
time...hahaha", says Rob). Rob tends to run desktops with WindowMaker, 
Galeon, irssi, and ardour, Muse, timidity, and freqtweak for audio stuff. 
He runs a small network at home with his desktop, an Athlon XP 1400+ with 
512MB RAM and a delta midiman card, his fiancee's two Window machines and 
Apple Powerbook (all with wavelan), as well as a Compaq Evo N400c for his 
LINX work. For his business he runs five or six PCs, all x86s with various 
hardware configurations. They mostly run apache, cyrus imapd and exim with 
some glue code he wrote in Perl to handle virtual domains without having 
to fiddle with a bunch of configuration files. His favorite apps include: 
vi, because he'd feel lost without it, ardour because it lets him write 
music without worrying about crashes, Jack because it doesn't leave 
glitches in audio while recording, Mulberry because he's a sucker for GUI 
email clients and its good IMAP support, and irssi because it easily does 
everything he needs in an IRC client. 
 
A guitarist, bass player, and drummer, Rob says he likes being able to 
play and record his own songs. He enjoys watching evil films like Seven 
and Roadkill, playing on his XBox, and spending time with Jasmine, his 
cat. On August 31st, he's going to marry his fiancee, Sarah, at the tender 
age of 21.

Local Rsync and Distfile Server
 
Nominated for our "best first post by a Forum newbie" award, 
Grimthorne[15] has graced the Documentation, Tips & Tricks section of the 
Forums with an excellent Howto on setting up a "Portage gateway", a 
single-entry-point for rsync'ing the portage tree and central repository 
for distfiles. For anyone administering more than a single Gentoo host at 
home or the office, this could prove to come in very handy indeed:

XPM bug attempts to remove XFree
 
Fast reflexes on behalf of one of the Forum moderators, bsolar[17], helped 
prevent damage from happening to Gentoo users' desktops on Thursday. The 
XPM (XPixMap) package had been removed from the portage tree, which 
unfortunately caused all of Xfree to disappear if someone had autocleaning 
enabled, a nasty bug that could have bitten a lot more people:
 
 * media-libs/xpm removed from Portage[18]

Unified tool for Gentoo specific tasks?
 
Brain waves are out there carrying thoughts about a unified configuration 
tool for the Gentoo specific configuration tasks. Gentoo specifig, meaning 
configurations like say what mirror portage is to fetch pagkages from. 
Michael Kohl, the idea man, speaks further[19] about the UI.

Proposed md5sum change.
 
The md5sum is a checksum system for safeguarding data and to letting users 
know when that all important data has been corrupted. This way portage 
lets the user know if an md5'ed package has changed. Though, portage looks 
at the md5sum for the compressed file fetched from the mirror and not its 
contents. Read about the differences and the pros and cons[20].

 20. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-dev&m=105534737320942&w=2
 
Ebuild question...
 
How flexible[21] is the package compilation / installation process with 
portage? And what about the information passed to the user about the 
packages during a multi package emerge?

 21. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-dev&m=105529590008411&w=2
 
Is it possible to run scripts in between decompression / compilation and 
installation of a package?

New Website for Swedish Gentooists
 
Anders Olsson and a group of fellow IT students at the Royal Institute of 
Technology[22] in Stockholm recently acquired the gentoo.se domain and 
have started building a nice little website[23] around it. Sweden used to 
be an IRC-only country, i.e. sporting a very active Swedish language 
channel on irc.freenode.net, but nothing much in terms of documentation 
and other Gentoo info was available besides that. All the usual content 
you'd find on most national Gentoo pages is still in planning stages, but 
Gentoo.se already offers webmail services! yourname@gentoo.se, anyone?
