<title>Modular X entering ~arch (testing)</title>
<body>

<p>
The X team members plan to remove all 289 modular X packages from
package.mask soon. They will enter ~arch (testing)
for all the architectures for which they're keyworded: alpha, amd64,
arm, ia64, mips, ppc, sh, sparc and x86. To learn how to upgrade
properly, read the 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/x/x11/modular-x-howto.xml">migration guide</uri>
before starting the upgrade. It discusses how the USE flags changed, why X.Org
went modular and why <c>emerge xorg-x11</c> won't be quite enough yet.
</p>

<p>
Not all packages in the tree will work with modular X when it enters
~arch, although the most common applications already do. The X team
encourages users and developers to contribute fixes to their favorite
packages by reading the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/x/x11/porting-modular-x-howto.xml">
porting guide</uri>. Applications requiring the most work include games
and packages without a listed maintainer in metadata.xml or altogether
lacking metadata.
</p>

<p>
<mail link="spyderous@gentoo.org">Donnie Berkholz</mail> provides a list of
all unported applications along with their maintainers, updated daily, in his
<uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~spyderous/broken_modular/">webspace</uri>.
A graph of porting progress exists in the same location. If you encounter any bugs
with the migration, please report them at <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org">

<title>End of lifetime announcement for old-style configuration Apache packages</title>
<body>

<p>
In October, the Apache team made stable a new configuration style for
apache and its modules. While many users have made the switch, many
cautious users have not.
</p>

<p>
The Apache team is announcing that they will no longer support the
old-style configuration of Apache after March 1, 2006. Anyone who has
not upgraded to <c>net-www/apache-2.0.55</c> and higher, or
<c>net-www/apache-1.3.34-r10</c> and higher should do so before then.
For information on how to upgrade, we provide an

Upgrading Apache Guide</uri>.

<title>PHP Herd's January meeting</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo's PHP Herd held their first  meeting in 2006 on January 21st. Topics on
the agenda included election of herd leads, SLOTting of PHP minor versions and
the stabilization of <c>dev-lang/php</c>.
</p>

<p>
<mail link="chtekk@gentoo.org">Luca Longinotti</mail> has been elected as lead for
core-PHP packages and <mail link="sebastian@gentoo.org">Sebastian Bergmann</mail>
as lead for PEAR packages. The PHP Herd agreed to keep the SLOTting scheme as is,
i.e. only major versions of PHP (PHP 4, PHP 5) will be slotted. The most notable
decision made from a users point of view forces users to migrate from <c>dev-php/php</c>
to <c>dev-lang/php</c> as soon as possible as the PHP Herd decided to no longer support them.
The old <c>dev-php/php</c> packages will be package.masked as soon as the
architecture teams have stabilized the new-style PHP packages, which is
expected by the end of February, and removed from the Portage tree about
two months later.
</p>

<p>
The minutes of the PHP Herd's January meeting are available at the 
<uri link="http://tinyurl.com/cc964">PHP Overlay website</uri>. Their next
meeting is scheduled for February 7th at 19:00 UTC in
#gentoo-php on irc.freenode.net.

<title>Slotted MySQL</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo's MySQL maintainers plan to move <c>=dev-db/mysql-4.1.16-r30</c> and
<c>dev-db/mysql-5.0.18-r30</c> into ~arch (testing) soon. Those <c>-r30</c>
revision Ebuilds now allow installing several MySQL versions in parallel,
or in Gentoo speak: They support SLOTting. While all minor versions beyond
or equal to 4.1 will become slotted, <c>dev-db/mysql-4.0*</c> will stay at
<c>SLOT="0"</c>.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, new Eclasses and an <c>eselect</c> module for easy
switching between MySQL versions were written. Though you can run several
MySQL versions simultaneously you are still limited to one (the current)
<c>libmysqlclient</c> at a time. To learn how to upgrade properly, read the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-upgrade-slotted.xml">migration guide</uri>
before starting the upgrade. All packages in the tree that worked before
<e>should</e> also work with slotted MySQL when it enters ~arch.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter any bugs with the migration, please report them at
<uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo's Bugzilla</uri>.

<title>gentoolkit update</title>
<body>

<p>
A new version of <c>app-portage/gentoolkit</c> (<c>0.2.1</c>) containing significant
improvements has been marked stable a few days ago. These are the
major changes between gentoolkit-0.2.0 and gentoolkit-0.2.1:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A new tool called <c>eclean</c> for removing no longer needed distfiles and
packages has been added
</li>
<li>
<c>revdep-rebuild</c> now allows for more user interaction and customizing.
You can avoid rebuilding binary packages like <c>app-office/openoffice-bin</c>
by setting the <c>SEARCH_DIRS_MASK</c> variable in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>
to for example skip packages installed in the <path>/opt</path> directory.
</li>
<li>
One major fix optimizing memory consumption has been applied to <c>equery</c>.
Also many fixes made it more usable, though it is still not the fastest program
on the block. If the lack of speed bothers you, we would recommend investigating
the <c>app-portage/portage-utils</c> package
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A detailed listing of the changes for those interested is in
<path>/usr/share/doc/gentoolkit-0.2.1/ChangeLog</path>.

Almost exactly a year after reaching two million posts in

the Gentoo Forums hit three million posts on Jan 24th. A

not only features the answer to the question "Whose post was it?", but also
leaves space for wild conspiracy theories about a mysterious decrease in postcount
shortly before the three millionth post was reached. The Gentoo Forums
were noted to be among the largest phpBB installations on

<title>"Prefixed Portage" for Gentoo for Mac OS X</title>
<body>

<p>
For the last few months, the Gentoo for Mac OS X project has been
serving as the primary testbed for a "prefix aware" portage and ebuild
repository.  This basically allows for a configurable 'offset prefix' in
which portage and all software it manages can be installed, as any user,
without any interference with the 'host' operating system.  The need for
such functionality arose from the ever-increasing problems of using
Portage in 'foreign' environments such as Apple's Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
While in its current state, it is serving merely as a working and
functional prototype, it has opened up many exciting possibilities for the
future of Gentoo and Portage.  Although the Gentoo for Mac OS X project
is the first project from the Gentoo/Alt umbrella project to have a
pressing need for portage installations that leave the host operating
system unmodified, it has proved to be of great interest to users and
developers alike who are having excellent results running portage on a
multitude of OS - AIX, HP-UX, FreeBSD, BeOS/Haiku/Zeta, Solaris, and
Fedora Core Linux.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo for Mac OS X team hopes to have preliminary documentation
and developer installer packages available as soon as possible.

<p><b>sed vs. gsed</b></p>
<p>
In his quest for Gentoo/Alt improvements <mail
link="flameeyes@gentoo.org">Diego Pettenò </mail> asks for advice on how to
handle sed as some of the alternative hosts for Gentoo use non-GNU sed,
which has a  slightly different behavior in some cases.

<p><b>RFC: emerge snapshots</b></p>
<p>
If something breaks during an update the "repair" often takes quite some
time. Are there any methods for doing a "rollback" to the old state of
the system to undo the breakage? What would need to be done to make this
feasible, and why is quickpkg often not good enough?
