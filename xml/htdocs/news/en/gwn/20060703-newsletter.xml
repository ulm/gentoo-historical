      <title>Modular X.Org stable</title>
      <body>
      <p>
        The Gentoo <uri link="/proj/en/desktop/x">X11</uri> team has marked
        the modular X.Org stable. The amd64 and x86 architectures will update
        to 7.0, due to planned changes in the ABI (Application Binary
        Interface) that have broken binary drivers, and other architectures
        will update to 7.1. This allows for quicker upgrades in the event of
        bugs and also security problems as well as reducing the on-disk and
        in-memory footprint of the X implementation. This also allows for
        X-based packages to be installed on headless servers without
        requiring that all of X be installed, too.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a <uri link="/proj/en/desktop/x/x11/modular-x-howto.xml">
        guide</uri> for upgrading to modular X, as well as giving information
        on the design behind the changes. As usual, bug reports are filed to
        <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">http://bugs.gentoo.org</uri>.

      <title>New Knowledge Base (KBase) project</title>
      <body>
      <p>
        The Gentoo <uri link="/proj/en/kbase">Knowledge Base</uri> project has
        been formed to provide a facility for informing users about specific
        information on packages. Unlike a wiki, the Gentoo Knowledge Base will
        be written by the developers exclusively. This ensures that the
        information is accurate. Like ebuilds in the tree, topics in the
        knowledge base will be maintained by a specific developer, to keep
        information from becoming outdated. While the actual postings will be
        limited to developers, users are encouraged to participate in the
        project both by proofreading and also by giving their valued input. If
        you would be interested in helping with the project, please subscribe
        to the <c>gentoo-kbase@lists.gentoo.org</c> mailing list. Archives are
        online at both <uri
        link="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.knowledge-base">
        Gmane</uri> and <uri

      <title>New Java system</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The <uri link="/proj/en/java">Gentoo/Java</uri> team is pleased to
          announce that the new Java system is now unmasked in the tree.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin using it, you will need to follow the <uri
          link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/java/java-upgrade.xml">upgrade
          guide</uri>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For those not familar with that this means, here are some highlights:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Ability to switch the current VM on the fly</li>
          <li>Changes to the user and system VM take effect immediately, and no
          longer are tied to the shell environment, which means you no longer
          have to run env-update followed by source /etc/profile when you
          switch the system VM</li>
          <li>Now has the concept of a "build VM", which is used to emerge
          packages and is configured independently of the system VM</li>
          <li>For each version of Java, ie 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, etc, the build VM can
          be configured as to which vendor and version of a VM to use</li>
          <li>The VM at emerge time will be switched on the fly according to its
          configuration, as well as the dependency of the package. For example,
          some packages won't compile with 1.5. In these cases, a 1.4 VM will be
          used at build time</li>
          <li>Java packages which build with ant will have their build.xml
          rewritten at build time in order to ensure that the correct version of
          Java bytecode is compiled</li>
          <li>Will be able to unmask Java 1.5 soon and be able to handle Java
          1.6 when it comes out this fall</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Since its reemergence in earlier 2005, the Spanish Gentoo Weekly
        Newsletter has continued to be published thanks to the hard work of a
        few active translators. In order to ensure its constant publishing the
        Spanish GWN translation team is looking for new members to help with
        the task. If you are an advanced speaker of both English and Spanish
        (native not required) and you are interested in collaborating with us,
        please send an e-mail to <mail link="gwn-feedback-es@gentoo.org">

      <title>"I'm a crazy mad Russian. Dig it." - Tim Yamin (plasmaroo)</title>
      <body>
      <figure link="/images/gwn/20060703_plasmaroo.jpg"
        short="plasmaroo" caption="Tim Yamin, aka plasmaroo" />

      <p>
        Developer Tim Yamin, better known as plasmaroo, resides in the UK. At
        17, he can recall moving from Russia about 10 years ago. He lives with
        his family and has no pets. There's no wonder why as he refers to them
        as "furry cretins."
      </p>

      <p>
        Tim is studying mathematics and plans to obtain a degree in Computer
        Science. He does not currently work as it's hard to find a flexible
        part-time job to compliment his study schedule. Looking towards the
        future, his dream job would involve lots of blinking LEDs, funky
        hardware, and lots of dollar signs. (Need those dollar signs to fund
        his Gentoo hardware habit.) Not working allows him to devote most of
        his time to Gentoo and coffee ice cream. Who could blame him - it's
        coffee and ice cream!
      </p>

      <p>
        As he describes it, he is often found babbling on IRC, but does manage
        to get in a bit of gaming as he really enjoys playing Enemy Territory.
        He likes to listen to funky music, usually progressive
        DnB/House/Trance/Hip-hop. While plasmaroo doesnt travel much yet, he
        would enjoy going through national parks and the like.
      </p>

      <p>
        When asked what he likes most about Gentoo, plasmaroo replied, "It does
        what I want, and if it doesn't, it will after a five-minute cluebatting
        session." Plasmaroo has worked on Gentoo for three years now. He
        started off working on kernel stuff (gentoo-sources) and then branched
        into other areas. He is part of several teams, including, Release
        Engineering, Documentation, Developer Relations, Kernel, Security,
        Gentoo/IA64, genkernel, and sci-electronics. The contribution that he
        is most proud of is the GLSAMaker system, which has been used for over
        two years now and has pushed out over 700 GLSAs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plasmaroo's home machines, while obviously all running Gentoo, consist
        of a dual Opteron workstation with 4GB of RAM, a P4 box that compiles
        stuff at an amazingly slow pace and acts as a very overpowered router,
        and four SGI boxes that he plans on using for kernel work. He'd like to
        say that he's using all of these systems as a compile cluster, but he
        has had some rather uncooperative motherboards that keep him busy.
        After his first cup of coffee ice cream, the first application
        plasmaroo launches is konsole and his preferred shell is zsh.

      <p><b>Moving away from Freenode?</b></p>
      <p>
        Currently, some users dislike the Freenode IRC network and are
        discussing moving all of the gentoo channels to another network, such
        as OFTC. Would this be something that others would be willing to do or
        are we happy with the service Freenode provides to Gentoo?

      <p><b>How often do you --sync?</b></p>
      <p>
        Is it easier to manage Gentoo if you <c>emerge --sync</c> daily, or is
        it more productive to wait a few weeks or until a package you want
        appears on <uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org">
        http://packages.gentoo.org</uri> before you sync? Post how often you
