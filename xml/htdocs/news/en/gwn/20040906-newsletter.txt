New BugDay website
------------------
  
We're very pleased to announce the new BugDay website[1], where you'll 
find a list of bugs that the BugDay team have compiled for the benefit of 
BugDay participants. Many of these bugs shouldn't be too difficult to fix, 
so this might be a good way for you to get started if you're new to 
development. We'd like to thank Bjarke Istrup Pedersen[2], the BugDay 
participant who made the page. The next BugDay will be held on October 
2nd; contact Bryan Ostergaard[3] with any questions.

2. Projects Update
==================
   
Devrel
 
The monthly bugday has a new webpage[4] to help co-ordinate community 
activities. Packages with known bugs are categorized and linked to help 
users find things to work on.

Releng
 
Release Engineering has started work on the 2004.3 release. The initial 
version of the 2004.3 Release Information Page[5] is online and is 
expected to change a few times during the release cycle. Goals for 2004.3 
include minimizing the size of the LiveCD, especially the minimal LiveCD, 
using only a single 2.6 kernel for both x86 and amd64, switching to udev 
as the device manager on the LiveCD itself, using cascading profiles by 
default across all architectures, and fixing any bugs from the 2004.2 
release.

Security
 
Security set a new productivity record by releasing 27 GLSAs[6] last 
month. These security announcements documented fixes for a variety of 
packages, including Python and rsync, as well as potential information 
leaks in the kernel and glibc.

MySQL: Insecure temporary file creation in mysqlhotcopy
-------------------------------------------------------
  
The mysqlhotcopy utility can create temporary files with predictable 
paths, allowing an attacker to use a symlink to trick MySQL into 
overwriting important data. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[8] 

 8. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200409-02.xml

Ruby: CGI::Session creates files insecurely
-------------------------------------------
  
When used for CGI scripting, Ruby creates session files in /tmp with the 
permissions of the default umask. Depending on that umask, local users may 
be able to read sensitive data stored in session files. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[14] 

 14. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200409-08.xml

4. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
   
Deedra Waters

This week, we are pleased to introduce Deedra Waters[17](dmwaters),the 
Operational Lead for Developer Relations, itinerant recruiter, 
organization Trustee, manager of Gentoo's mail infrastructure and Lead for 
Gentoo's Accessibility project. Deedra is also a senior staff member for 
the freenode IRC network, and is in the process of moving from Florida to 
a new job in the Open Source lab at Oregon State University, where she 
will be enrolling as a student this Fall. 

 17. dmwaters@gentoo.org
 
Deedra's primary duties include identifying and recruiting new developers 
for the project, ensuring that developers have the resources and 
communication channels they need, and helping resolve any conflicts that 
arise. As a member of Gentoo's Board of Trustees, she is currently helping 
with copyright assignment and other legal niceties that are required for 
the smooth running of a non-commercial distro. For the accessibility 
project, she helps co-ordinate the identification and importation of 
accessibility software for handicapped Gentoo users, such as software 
packages for visually impaired users, or those who cannot use a standard 
keyboard. It is the latter endeavor that she is especially proud of having 
helped establish, characterizing it with the statement that "Linux is a 
wonderful thing for blind users for several reasons, and I think that 
Gentoo is the most accessible distro out there." 
 
Deedra began using Linux with Debian in 2001, and was given a 
self-directed crash course when the friend who had installed it for her 
left the country. When Kurt Lieber[18] introduced her to Gentoo (or, as 
she says, "bribed her to use it") last year, she switched over to using 
Gentoo. Shortly thereafter, she volunteered to help out, and began working 
on managing the mailing lists for the Infrastructure team, and later was 
named a Developer to assist with implementing accessibility features. 

 18. klieber@gentoo.org
 
Some of our standard interview questions, such as "what Desktop Engine do 
you prefer?" were mooted by the fact that Deedra is totally blind - which 
many people who have encountered her online will be surprised to hear. 
This has affected her choice of favorite apps, which tend to be 
"best-of-breed" console apps such as mutt, pine, irssi, zinf, subversion 
and keychain. She uses SpeakUp[19] for converting text to speech. She took 
a few moments to talk about people's reactions: "I'm totally blind, and 
have been since I was born.Some people feel sorry for me when they hear 
that, or feel bad for asking me questions about it, but it's one of those 
things that don't bother me. The way I explain it to people is a bit like 
'I don't really care about not being able to see. I've never been able to, 
so I don't miss it.'" Which is enough about that.

5. Heard in the Community

Web Forums

Gmail Tools
 
Well, no, Gmail stands not for Gentoo Mail, unfortunately. But Google's 
invited-beta-testers-only, 1GB-per-inbox webmail system has attracted many 
Gentoo users, who are now busy trying to figure out what to do with their 
accounts. Some things are barely legal (mounting the Gmail disk space as a 
file system most certainly isn't in compliance with Google's license 
agreement), others are more subtle in offering alert mechanisms for new 
messages in your Gmail inbox, for example. Not surprisingly, every change 
in the settings over at the Gmail servers breaks gtray and assorted other 
desklets, but they're suspected to catch up, of course. There's even an 
ebuild for libgmail, the foundation for any of those utilities, but the 
Gentoo developers have made it clear at the same time that it will not be 
part of Portage unless Google says it's ok to do so. In case you don't 
have a Gmail account yet, check towards the end of the "anyone want 
gmail?" thread, there are always Gentoo forum users offering fresh 
invitations.

Message User Agents
 
This week, gentoo-user list member David Vincent posed a few questions on 
his conversion from Microsoft Outlook to KDE's Kmail application. Where 
could he change settings for message color tagging? What about not 
immediately deleting messages? What about allowing HTML emails from only 
senders you specify? His questions were answered; but in typical community 
fashion it also spawned a varied discussion on how to accomplish these 
things and more with all types of messaging agents.
