distcc in a nutshell
--------------------
  
A question often asked by our readers is, "What is distcc?". In a 
nutshell, distcc[1] allows you to distribute compilation of C or C++ code 
across several machines on a network. For home users with multiple 
computers, this means you can distribute the load of compiling KDE 3.1 
across all your Gentoo machines. For embedded devices or older computers, 
it means you can build packages on a faster machine (or group of machines) 
to take advantage of the increased processing power. distcc works closely 
with gcc to ensure that distcc distributed compiles produce the same 
result as using gcc directly. 

 1. http://distcc.samba.org/
 
distcc 1.2.3 was recently marked as stable in the Portage tree, so users 
are encouraged to try it out and discover the wonders of distributed 
compiling. Obviously, there's a lot more to distcc than is described here. 
Users interested in learning more should check out the following 
resources:

Remarkable response to our call for developers
----------------------------------------------
  
In last week's GWN[2], we posted a number of open positions[3] in the 
Gentoo Linux project. The response to this posting was remarkable, with 
nearly 75 responses received. As a result, Gentoo Linux now has the 
assistance of two new documentation editors and a new kernel developer. 
We're still sorting through the respondents to the Web Developer position 
and will be contacting folks with regards to that in the coming days.

Where possible, we've tried to send individual responses to each of the 
respondents. If you haven't received a response, we apologize and thank 
you for offering to help Gentoo Linux. We'll continue to post open 
positions in future editions of the GWN, so keep an eye out for them.

gentoo-security
---------------
  
Arthur Britto started a persistent thread on the gentoo-security list by 
posting a message[13] complaining about GLSAs (Gentoo-Linux Security 
Announcements) being cross-posted to gentoo-security and gentoo-announce. 
The discussion quickly split into two camps - those arguing that 
redundancy in important messages was valuable and those insisting that a 
clearly defined single channel for GLSAs was more important. The 
conversation occasionally evolved into discussions about whether using 
filters and procmail to strip redundant messages was the right way to 
resolve it, and even included suggestions for setting up a third, 
dedicated, list for GLSAs. The thread finally concluded with a plea[14] 
for it to stop along with the official pronouncement that all GLSAs will 
in the future be posted only to gentoo-announce, and that gentoo-security 
should be confined to discussions about security issues rather than 
security announcements.

Figure 3.1: Jared H. Hudson
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20030310_jhhudso.jpg 
Jared H. Hudson[15], whom we feature this week, is the x86 QA Coordintor 
and the x86 stages/GRPs Coordinator as of Gentoo Linux's latest 1.4_rc3 
release candidate. This means he's responsible for making sure that the 
stages and GRPs work properly so that users can install Gentoo Linux. 
Jared's involvement with Gentoo (which happens to be the first OSS project 
he has worked on) began with his fixing a bug in a Gentoo package, 
impressing a senior developer. Accepting a subsequent invitation to join 
the team, Jared has been handling bug reports like the other developers, 
especially in PHP, DNS, emacs, and vim - his areas of expertise. He also 
created use.desc (located in /usr/portage/profiles/), which lists what the 
use flags in Gentoo do. 

 15. jhhudso@gentoo.org
 
Jared's last job was as a Linux sysadmin for a web hosting company that 
went bankrupt; now he's seeking employment. He lives in Fayetteville, 
Arkansas (though he would like to move to Europe) with two cats: Script 
(she's a script kitty) and Frankie, and a dual Athlon 1200 box running 
Waimea, and often xmms, emacs, gcc, mozilla, and gaim. Jared loves reading 
and has been playing Magic: the Gathering lately.

1.4-rc3-triggered Newbie Influx
 
Even the oldest hands seem to wear a badge saying "I'm friendly to 
newbies" these days, setting aside an extraordinary amount of patience and 
helpful advice for the many newcomers attracted by the third release 
candidate. Is it safe to use? Will it do what my <insert prior Linux 
distribution> could do? Will it change my life, water the plants, walk the 
dog? Just ask, somebody will answer without patronizing or spitting 
gratuitous flames at you:

New Dutch Forum Moderator Needed
 
The Dutch forum is in need of someone to crack the whip from time to time. 
Don't worry, they usually behave exceptionally well. It's all about 
spotting the occasional duplicate thread, making important announcements 
sticky and looking over the forum's well-being in general. Post 
applications to this thread or send a personal message to the site admin

Gentoo and the LSB

A hot discussion[17] took place recently regarding Gentoo's compliance 
with the LSB. Currently there are two issues holding Gentoo from being an 
"LSB Compliant" distribution. The first being that LSB requires the 
ability to install RPMs on a system. The second offender is that KDE and 
Gonome are in different directories, and that the LSB standard can easily 
be scrutinized ATM. A few suggestions[18] on handling the directory 
hiearchy of the GUI desktops made their way into the thread, which lead to 
worthwhile explanations of the different parts of a *nix file system. 
Remembering that both Gentoo and the LSB are new and developing projects, 
hopes of a brighter future will come. For now, the LSB experiences mixed 
attitudes within the Gentoo-user community, from enthusiasts to claims 
that the LSB is, and will always be a " straight jacket[19]".

CFLAGS... Get your CFLAGS...
 
As long as there is Gentoo, there will be questions about CFLAGS and 
compiler optimizations. Due to the fact that Gentoo is a source based 
distribution, and that these sources are likely to be compiled under the 
direction of a tweaked out penguin, a lot of emphasis is placed on 
choosing the best set of options for the system's hardware. For most of us 
the decision is made quickly by using one of the many examples available 
for all sorts of hardware. To delve further into the subject, and make 
sense of what these flags actually mean provides a very insightful read. 
Jason Giangrande's thread[20] not only surfaced many examples[21] , but 
provided some links to great explanatory resources.[22]

Cruft detecting script
 
Andy Arbon proposed[23] the creation of a cruft detecting script, i.e. a 
script that would detect all the files that Portage has lost track of and 
therefore will lay in the filesystem as long as we do not do something 
about it. A quick hack[24] was posted by Evan Powers but more tuning and 
exploring seems to be needed with this useful utility.

Open Gentoo Linux Development Positions
 
John P. Davis posted an announcement saying[25] that Gentoo Linux is 
recruiting new developers.

man vs. man-db
 
James H. Cloos Jr. mentioned[26] that Gentoo is currently using man[27] 
which seems quite outdated and that man-db[28] seems a better alternative 
and it is being used by popular GNU/Linux distributions like Debian and 
Suse.

Vienna Meeting Report
 
Fortunately, improvisation is second nature for Gentoo users: If you don't 
know how to solve a problem, you're not worthy of having one in the first 
place. Last week, the Vienna Gentoo user crowd had to change the venue for 
their meeting on the fly because the original location's staff, 
("presumably blonde"), had managed to misplace the reservation. As it 
turned out, the neighboring Community Center of the Austrian Communist 
Party, Cafe 7Stern, was more hospitable, featuring a waitress with strong 
beliefs ("Better take a beer like everyone else, laddie") and a wacko lady 
occasionally visiting the Gentoo table asking why the show on stage wasn't 
about to begin. Latecomers missed the fun because of the location change, 
but everybody else was visibly enjoying the meeting, and they're already 
discussing follow-ups. The full account (in German) is posted here[29].

You now have your own CA with which to sign certificates. Your CA public 
key is /etc/ssl/demoCA/cacert.pem and your private key is 
/etc/ssl/demoCA/private/cakey.pem. 

When using a certificate signed by your CA, you may get an error about 
an untrusted CA. In this case, you'll need to publish your CA public key 
to the client.
