Official Gentoo port to IA64 begun
----------------------------------
  
Earlier this week Daniel Robbins[1] announced[2] on gentoo-dev that HP had 
donated a dual-CPU Itanium 2 system to Gentoo and spelled out the steps in 
the porting plan, mainly consisting of getting Portage to work in 
Debian/IA64 and converting it to a native Gentoo installation, and 
expanding IA64 support throughout the Portage tree. What no one expected, 
though, was for someone to chime in[3] with a working stage1 tarball and 
enough ebuild patches to have a usable headless system. The donated 
machine is now set up on Daniel Robbins' LAN and is awaiting conversion to 
Gentoo. If you have experience with IA64 and wish to help in some 
capacity, please email Seemant Kulleen[4] and cc Daniel Robbins[5]. This 
port will probably proceed quickly because of the many developers 
interested in the port as well as this early boost; check future 
newsletters for information on its progress.

This week, we are featuring Adrian Almenar[10] (strider). Adrian works 
primarily with Gentoo's java team, fixing bugs and maintaining the 
packages in dev-java/*. He particularly focuses on maintaining the JDK 
packages and java-config, as well as xalan-j, xerces-j, ant, maven and 
jikes. Gentoo is his first major role as a developer on an open-source 
project, but he has collaborated on translating materials for 
Jakarta-Tomcat. The work he is most proud of was commencing the port of 
java-config to python, a task that was completed by Todd Berman[11] and 
Jason Mobarak[12].

Adrian lives and works in Caracas, Venezuela, where the climate encourages 
his fondness for cold beer. He is employed as a java programmer for a 
mobile Internet services company, where 90% of the production servers are 
now Gentoo-based. At night, he is studying Economic Sciences at the 
Universidad Central de Venezuela, after studying Computer Science for some 
years. Despite daytime work, night courses, and weekends working on 
Gentoo, he still manages to spend a little time with his girlfriend, 
Stella. He also claims to be able to find time to pursue hobbies in Ham 
radio, electronics and telecommunications as well as the more prosaic 
pastimes of reading, movies and going out with friends. 
 
Adrian prefers to use XFCE4 as his Window Manager at work, but uses KDE at 
home for his mother's sake (yes, his mother uses Gentoo). He uses 
Sylpheed-claws to manage his 5 email accounts, and prefers 
Mozilla-Firebird, Gaim, XMMS, J-Pilot, GKrellm, vim and kvim for other 
tools. His home computers are a Pentium IV 1.8 GHz (768 Mb, Geforce 2) 
development box and an Athlon 800 MHz (128 Mb, TNT2) that serves as a mail 
server, firewall, and computer for his mother. 
 
Adrian first began using Linux with Slackware in 1996, when he used it for 
Web development and Java programming in his first job. He became aware of 
Gentoo in April of 2002, and began using it that June, when the 1.2 
release was available. When he discovered how well it met his needs, he 
began using it at work, and eventually assisted with the migration of many 
of his company's computers to Gentoo. He offered us a quote from the movie 
Hackers, which he says describes Linux' role in the OS market: "Mess with 
the best, die like the rest."

The Race for the G5
 
When oubipaws[13] casually claimed he had been running Gentoo Linux on his 
Apple Macintosh G5, the Gentoo PPC developer elite flocked to the thread 
to see what was going on. Sadly, the skeptics prevailed in the end, but at 
least the excitement was real... And even the most fool-proof devs are 
definitely glad to see so many people trying Gentoo Linux on their new G5 
machines:

From Denmark with Love
 
Not everyone is looking for just fifteen minutes of fame... Rather than 
pushing their personalities to the front, some people are quite successful 
at using the Forum as a channel to get their work into the limelight. At 
20,000 regulars on board, and a rather grateful audience at that, this is 
often greeted with loud cheers and upped thumbs by Forum users. This 
week's most blatantly obvious example of a non-official development stint 
anchored in a Forum thread comes from Lovechild[15]. The Forum legend and 
notorious Breakmygentoo[16] contributor now even has his own kernel patch 
set out, and last week opened shop in a thread at the forums that has 
become second home to a merry bunch of desktop performance guerilleros:

Germany: "Practical Linux" Show on 11 October in Gießen
 
Benjamin Judas, aka Beejay[19], a Gentooist living a mere half hour from 
the conference venue, has announced Gentoo's participation in this year's 
Practical Linux Day[20], an annual event at the Fachhochschule Gießen[21] 
(University of Applied Science), located about 80 km north of 
Frankfurt/Main. Beejay will give a presentation during the main session, 
and a Gentoo booth will undoubtedly be manned by the usual suspects. A 
shipment of freshly minted LiveCD is rumoured to be on its way for sale at 
the show. Tell the other lads you're coming at at the corresponding forum 
thread[22] (in German).

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
An introduction to sudo
 
This week's tip demonstrates some common uses of sudo which allows normal 
users to run commands with elevated privileges. This week we look at using 
sudo to view log files and handle basic user administration. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.1:                                                       |
| Getting sudo                                                            |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|% emerge app-admin/sudo                                                  |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The first thing to do is set up the /etc/sudoers file which controls all 
the privileges handled by sudo. Instead of editing this file directly, use 
the visudo command. For a full list of configuration options, see the 
sudoers man page (man 5 sudoers). 
 
This file is just an example and demonstrates how to create command and 
user aliases. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.2:                                                       |
| /etc/sudoers                                                            |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# sudoers file.                                                          |
|#                                                                        |
|# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.            |
|#                                                                        |
|# See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.|

|                                                                         |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now that your /etc/sudoers file has been created, you can issue commands 
using sudo command. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Adding a new user as the user jfox                                       |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
While this is no means comprehensive, this should introduce you to some of 
the many possibilities of sudo. For more examples and options see the man
