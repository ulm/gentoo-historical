<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</uri> recently <uri
link="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2007/01/flash_player_9_for_linux_x86.html">released</uri>
the final version of Flash Player 9 for Linux. Gentoo developers were quick to
add it to the tree. Note that this version of Flash does not include a debug
version, and it is still hard-masked. Thanks to <mail
link="jakub@gentoo.org">Jakub Moc</mail> and <mail
link="tester@gentoo.org">Olivier Crete</mail>, for taking care of it so fast.

<title>Adopt-a-developer Project Update</title>
<body>

<p>
The Adopt-a-dev project has been neglected lately. The project would like to
remind the users that developers can always make use of hardware or technical
books to help bring better support and build a better distribution.
Contributions are most welcome! For example, <mail
link="flameeyes@gentoo.org">Diego</mail> recently needed a cheap, low-end
SoundBlaster card. This is the area where you can help his ALSA development
efforts with a small donation.
</p>

<p>
<mail link="chriswhite@gentoo.org">Chris White</mail> received a book on perl
from a user; he's putting it to good use maintaining and testing the perl
packages. Thanks!
</p>

<p>
Once again, we need both developers and users to request and offer any resources
that can be donated. It doesn't have to be a substantial donation -- you'd be
surprised how often a simple item turns out to be exactly what is needed.

That's right. Now that <mail link="diox@gentoo.org">Dimitry Bradt</mail> has joined the
GWN staff, we're restarting the <b>Developer of the Week</b> feature. Have a
developer you'd like to see interviewed? You can
always mail us about this using the following address:
<mail link="gwn-feedback@gentoo.org">gwn-feedback@gentoo.org</mail>.
</p>

<p>
This week's featured developer is <mail link="diox@gentoo.org">Dimitry

Chris, can you add the interview, along with this picture ?

<p><b>Introducing Planet Paludis!</b></p>

<p>
<mail link="eroyf@gentoo.org">Alexander Færøy</mail>, a contributor at the
<uri link="http://paludis.pioto.org">Paludis</uri> project, wrote a blog post
about their new asset, <uri>http://planet.paludis.org</uri>.
For the people living under rocks, Paludis is an upcoming alternative to
Portage written in C++, offering improved performance, a more flexible
configuration system and providing many much-asked-for features that were
unable to be added to the <c>Portage</c>. Planet Paludis is updated every 30
minutes to bring its community speedy updates.
</p>

<p>
Because most of the Paludis developers are also Gentoo Developers (and because
Paludis is a cool package manager), <mail link="kugelfang@gentoo.org">Danny Van
Dyk</mail> will give a talk on it at <uri
link="http://www.fosdem.org">Fosdem2007</uri>. He'll be explaining how people
can simplify maintaining packages within a basic Gentoo installation.

<b>Suggestions for a minimalistic system</b>
</p>

<p>
Vlad Dogaru was trying to create a minimalistic system to run on an older
computer with 384MB of RAM. He was considering switching to Ratpoison as a
window manager. Also, he was looking for a replacement for Firefox, but his
experiments with <c>Conkeror</c> and <c>links</c> had proven unsatisfactory, as
the former was too <c>emacs</c>-oriented and the latter lacked tabs.
</p>

<p>
Readers were unfamiliar with <uri
link="http://conkeror.mozdev.org/">Conkeror</uri>, an offshoot of Firefox with
keyboard-only navigation modelled after <c>emacs</c>. Some confused it with KDE's
Konqueror. Others, while interested in the project, noted that, with or without
a minimalistic interface, Conkeror was still Firefox under the hood, and as big
of a memory hog as Firefox.
</p>

<p>
Readers suggested using Dillo, which is both lightweight and has tabs. Dillo has
the disadvantage (if it is one) of not running Flash and having primitive
Javascript capabilities. Others suggested Opera, which, while not free/libre
software, was fast and tabbed.
</p>

<p>
Window manager suggestions included evilwm, pekwm, XFCE and, oddly, KDE. The
point was made that use of an integrated environment, be it KDE or Gnome, can
be more efficient since the apps share libraries. Issues arise only when one
tries to mix and match KDE and Gnome and wind up loading both sets of libraries.

<title>Australia: Linux.conf.au, Sydney</title>
<body>

<p>
Last week, a few Gentoo developers attended at the Linux Conference in Sydney,
Australia.  Attending devs were: <mail link="dostrow@gentoo.org">Daniel
Ostrow</mail>, <mail link="mark_alec@gentoo.org">Mark Kowarsky</mail>, <mail
link="pingu@gentoo.org">Christian Marie</mail> and <mail
link="dragonheart@gentoo.org">Daniel Black</mail>. Though they didn't have a
booth, they did have a great time. The most fascinating talks were: Keith
Packard's talk on <b>RandR</b>, Andrew Cowie's and Madely's talk on <b>Gtk
programming</b> and Chris Blizzard's talk on <b>OLPC</b>.

<p>
This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri
link="/proj/en/qa/treecleaners">Treecleaners</uri> and various developers. Most
packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
