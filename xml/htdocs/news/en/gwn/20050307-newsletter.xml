<title>Gentoo 2005.0 security rebuild</title>
<body>
<p>
A set of <uri link="/news/20050303-2005.0-secrebuild.xml">exploitable 
bugs</uri> in <c>gaim</c> and <c>mozilla-firefox</c> (remote exploits) and in 
<c>qt</c> and <c>kdelibs</c> (locally exploitable) has been discovered just in 
time before the final Gentoo Linux 2005.0 release build. Although this 
interrupted the build and prevented it from finishing mere hours before its 
completion was scheduled, Gentoo's release engineering team unanimously decided 
to drop it and reconstruct the release media with all the security bugs 
resolved prior to release. Thanks to the Gentoo security team for catching the 
bugs, and the profiles' lead developers for putting up with the delay and 
testing the builds on their architectures yet again!

<title>Gentoo staging/master rsync server migrated</title>
<body>
<p>
Thanks to the donation of an Opteron 246 server from Nvidia, Gentoo is
now running their staging mirror and master rsync mirror on new
hardware. <mail link="ramereth@gentoo.org">Lance Albertson</mail> and <mail 
link="carpaski@gentoo.org">Nick Jones</mail> completed the Portage 
regeneration move last wednesday with little or no problems. This server 
synchronizes from CVS every thirty minutes, then regenerates the 
<path>depcache</path> which can take a lot of I/O and time to finish. From 
there, the public <c>rsync</c> servers sync from it. The old server was a 
single 1Ghz Pentium III and could finish this regen process within 10-30 
minutes. The new Opteron server does the same thing in a matter of 1-2 
minutes. This is an amazing improvement and will definitely allow us to scale 
well as the tree continues to grow. Just a note, the update frequency has not 
changed, so please don't waste your time trying to update every 2 minutes. 
</p> 
<p>
Also, most of the mirroring files were moved to this server a month ago,
with the exception of <path>distfiles</path>. We were running out of space on 
the old server, and this new server has a lot more space for us to grow on. 
Nick Jones is currently working on a better script that catches missing
<path>distfiles</path> and cleans old ones. Hopefully we'll start using this 
script in production in the next few weeks, in order to save space on our 
mirrors for other projects.

<title>Forum software updates</title>
<body>
<p>
Software enhancements done to the Gentoo Forums may well require a weekly 
column of their own soon. The frequency of updates has already been high over 
the past few weeks, but all these changes were just made to make even bigger 
changes possible. Expect more to come, particularly with regard to "Mission 
UTF-8", an ongoing effort to switch the forums completely to Unicode, 
supported by tools that have already been put in place to aid the switch over
the next few months.
</p>
<p>
Three important changes were done in the last two weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We finally <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-31173.html">added 
jabber</uri> to the user profiles. <mail link="ian@gentoo.org">Christian 
Hartmann</mail> created a <uri 
link="http://blog.iansview.com/archives/33-phpBB-2.0.11-Jabber-Mod.html">Jabber-Mod
for the phpBB 2.0.x branch</uri>, Forum user <uri
link="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=136326">ptlis</uri>
then merged this with his own Jabber-Mod that has since been made <uri
link="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=219163">available at
phpBB.com</uri>.</li>
<li>The subSilver and Gentoo-Lite themes were removed, mainly to speed up 
development and to minimize potential sources for bugs or other future 
problems. Apologies to those losing the ability for choosing alternative 
profiles, but it's obviously much easier for the administrators to make and 
maintain changes in the future if little-used themes can be eliminated. The 
default Gentoo-theme was the only one kept because it is used by the 
overwhelming majority of Forum users, out of more than 80,000 registered forum 
IDs, only 450 were linked to the subSilver theme, and 4500 had chosen 
Gentoo-Lite. </li>
<li><uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-288558.html">Some 
adjustments</uri>  have been made to the textbox of the postview window, thanks 
to the great Forum community for keeping track of that.

<title>System application reshuffle: Heads up!</title>
<body>
<p>
In a swift action affecting more than 200 packages residing in Portage's 
<path>sys-apps</path> category, <mail link="ciaranm@gentoo.org">Ciaran 
McCreesh</mail> is currently busy moving some of them into other existing 
categories, while others will find entirely new homes in the tree. The 
applications in question are <uri 
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~ciaranm/tmp/sys-apps.txt">listed in a file</uri> 
sitting in Ciaran's devspace, if you find problems with a package after it has 
been moved, <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">please file a bug</uri> or 
contact Ciaran on <path>irc.freenode.net</path>. Particularly Gentoo users with 
<path>sys-apps</path> in an individual overlay may want to pay special 
attention to the changes.

<title>Looking for testimonials on Gentoo business usage</title>
<body>
<p>
One of the things that we are always looking for at Gentoo is
information on people using Gentoo to make their lives easier. This
could be anything from using Gentoo machines as a render farm or rolled
out into desktop usage, to just a small corporate firewall. Information
such as this can help us better determine where we are and where we
should be focusing our efforts. If you have a Gentoo success story,
then we would love to hear about it! Information about large
deployments or Gentoo usage in unusual markets are mostly what we are
looking to receive. Send your story to <mail 
link="usage-feedback@gentoo.org">usage-feedback@gentoo.org</mail> today.
</p>
<note>Although some interesting projects will certainly receive coverage 
in the GWN, we respect your wish for confidentiality if the project 
doesn't allow for publication. Please mark your story as confidential 
when submitting it to the <mail link="usage-feedback@gentoo.org">usage 
feedback address</mail>, it will only be discussed among directly 
affected developers in that case.

"The best thing about Gentoo is the community." -- Albert Hopkins (marduk)
</title>
<body>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20050307_marduk.jpg"
	short="Marduk" 
	caption="Albert Hopkins aka marduk" />
<p>
This week's featured developer <mail link="marduk@gentoo.org">Marduk</mail> is 
a member of the Infrastructure group, responsible for developing and 
maintaining one of the most exciting elements of Gentoo's web presence, the 
<uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org">packages.gentoo.org site</uri>. He'd be 
interested in many other areas of Gentoo, but making sure the packages database 
site stays up, fixing bugs, and further development takes up most of his free 
time. That doesn't keep him from being in the process of re-writing the entire 
presentation, though, and he has many ambitions for the new site, too many to 
list here... 
</p>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20050307_pgo.png"

	caption="A view of things to come: Refurbishing the package database" />
<p> 
Gentoo is his most significant OSS project to date, but Marduk has been 
developing open-source software for several years. He authored a program called 
Linbot, which was a web crawler/link validating tool written in Python that 
received a lot of recognition in its time, with reviews appearing in Linux 
magazines, inclusion in distributions and a Python book. "I'm very passionate 
about the Python programming language. I have been hacking in Python since 1997. 
While I still occasionally look at other programming languages, I always go 
back to Python," says Marduk. Unfortunately for Linbot, he received a "cease 
and desist" letter one day because the name was apparently too close to the 
name of a commercial application, and he hasn't worked on or distributed the 
software since then. The few smaller programs he continues distributing are 
kept at his own <uri link="http://starship.python.net/crew/marduk/software/">repository</uri>.
</p>
<p>
Marduk is an administrator for Linux and Linux-like systems at a major U.S. 
clinical laboratory. A college drop-out who nonetheless attended Cornell 
University majoring in Electrical Engineering, he used to work at a 
supercomputer facility and always loved that, still keeping a vivid interest in 
high performance computing, but regrets not to be able to afford the hardware. 
His current <uri link="http://starship.python.net/crew/marduk/sysinfo/">main 
box</uri> was just recently upgraded to an AMD64, and he made sure "it's got 
all the trimmings," says Marduk. "The first application I launch is 
<c>evolution</c>, and if you <c>ps</c> my box, you'll most likely also find 
<c>vim</c>, <c>epiphany</c>, <c>gnome-terminal</c> and, of course, 
<c>python</c>."
</p>
<p>
Marduk lives in the Dallas, TX area. He's single (now accepting applications), 
and his hobbies outside of computing that he felt worth mentioning during the 
interview include movies, long drives in his Audi TT roadster, indie music, 
silence, science, and sociology.

<title>Gentoo International</title>
<section>
<title>Germany: Chemnitzer Linuxtage</title>
<body>
<p>
<mail link="pylon@gentoo.org">Lars Weiler</mail>, <mail link="dertobi123">Tobias 
Scherbaum</mail> and Jens Blaesche ("Mr. Big") represented Gentoo at this year's 
Chemnitzer Linuxtage, a conference and expo in East Germany's Saxony region that 
has been growing in importance since it was first organized last year, with more 
presentations in the main track, the usual suspects in the exposition hall, and 
a nice crowd mostly from Saxony itself, but also attracting visitors from other 
parts of Germany. The Gentoo booth had a Pegasos Open Desktop Workstation on 
display, a Sun Ultra10 running Gentoo, and the recent Brussels invention of the 
<path>/dev/snack</path> box of sweets was equally popular with visitors. 
Particularly rewarding for the booth staff who had been here already at last 
year's event: visitors they had met back then and who had asked generally 
uninformed "What is Gentoo?" questions now came back sporting "Portage addict" 
t-shirts and laptops with Gentoo Linux running on them. A German version of the 
Fizzlewizzle LiveDVD (see FOSDEM report last week), complete with KDE and 
<path>distfiles</path> sources, was the top-seller at this regional event, 
very welcome in this area of Germany where broadband Internet connections are 
difficult to be had.

<title>Gentoo in the press</title>
<section>
<title>OSdir.com (4 March 2005)</title>
<body>
<p>
The lack of support forums or other "groundswell support from users" is the topic
of an article in O'Reilly's operating systems magazine. Author Steve Mallett asks 
<uri link="http://www.osdir.com/Article4435.phtml">"Where is the SuSE Community?"</uri>, 
and compares the missing user community presence to other popular distributions: 
"A search for Fedora, Mandrake, or Gentoo for instance and you have no problem 
finding forums, wikis, official and unofficial FAQs. Signs of life." observes 
OSdir.com's managing editor.

<p>
Author Prosper describes the gentoo-stats project in <uri 
link="http://www.apple-linux.org/news.php?id=940">an article</uri> on the 
French Linux forum for Apple computers. "The basc project permits to calculate 
the time to install an ebuild. Packages are represented by GU (Gentoo units), 
if you know how many seconds one GU takes to compile on your system, it's 
enough to simply multiply those." </p>

<title>Todo-Linux.com (28 February 2005, in Spanish)</title>
<body>
<p>The Spanish magazine <uri 
link="http://www.todo-linux.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2580">reports 
about Intel and AMD</uri> pushing for 64-bit computing in the user realm, and 
observes that while Microsoft doesn't currently have an operating system that 
fully supports the hardware, Linux distributions, "for example Gentoo", are 
listed as totally functioning under 64-bit conditions.

<title>Tips and Tricks</title>

<title>Emerge flags deserving more attention</title>
<body>
<p>
There are a few flags <c>emerge</c> accepts that can give some insight
as to what it is (or will be) doing. We've described some of the newer ones
that have been added with portage-2.0.51, but there are a couple of older 
switches that users may have forgotten about. Here's a quick look at two of
those.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a little more commonly used is the first one, <path>--verbose</path>, 
or <path>-v</path>. It displays the USE flags that a package recognizes, and 
which ones are currently enabled or disabled. When running <c>emerge</c> with 
the <path>--newuse</path> flag, it even puts an asterisk to those flags that 
have been enabled or disabled since the last time a package was built. It also 
displays the size of files that need to be downloaded for a particular package, 
in addition to the total download file size for all packages to be emerged.
</p>
<p>
The second is <path>--tree</path>, or <path>-t</path>. This displays the 
dependency tree by indenting dependencies. Here's an example to illustrate the 
effect of this flag:
</p>
<pre caption="Indented packages showing their dependencies">
[ebuild  N    ] x11-plugins/gkrellm-sensors-0.1  <codenote>This tells us that gkrellm-sensors</codenote>
[ebuild  N    ]  app-admin/gkrellm-1.2.13        <codenote>requires gkrellm and lm_sensors,</codenote>
[ebuild  N    ]  sys-apps/lm_sensors-2.8.7       <codenote>and lm_sensors requires i2c.</codenote>
[ebuild  N    ]   sys-apps/i2c-2.8.7  
</pre>
<p>
By combining <path>--verbose</path> and <path>--tree</path>, you'll get a much 
clearer picture of exactly what <c>emerge</c> is doing. Needless to say, this 
makes it much easier to tweak your USE flags for better control over which 
packages are being installed.
