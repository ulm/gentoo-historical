Gentoo Linux 2004.0 marks the debut of Catalyst, the new Gentoo release 
meta-tool. Using Catalyst, developers and users can create and customize 
every aspect of their Gentoo Linux system; from installation stages, to 
bootable LiveCDs, to customized binary packages for the Gentoo Reference 
Platform (GRP). For more information on Catalyst, please see the Catalyst 
project page and online documentation[3].

Installation stages, LiveCDs, and Gentoo Reference Platform sets can be 
found on our mirrors[4]. More information about the Gentoo Hardened 
project can be found on its project page[5]. For more information, please

This week, we are featuring Alexander Gabert[10] (pappy), another 
developer specializing in the security realm for Gentoo. Alexander is the 
lead for the gcc-hardened project, which has the goal of implementing 
security enhancements such as PIE (position independent executables) and 
PaX[11] address space randomization and stack protection. He is also 
co-lead, along with Ned Ludd[12] (solar), for the implantation of 
propolice[13], another stack protection utility. In addition, he is 
exploring work with the HPPA team on implementing Gentoo for pa-risc 
processors as well as adding user documentation for Hardened Gentoo[14].

Alexander came to Gentoo via Red Hat and SuSE through BSD, OpenVMS and 
Linux from Scratch. He was impressed with the opportunity to apply some of 
his interest in security to the new distro. In particular, he was 
interested in implementing the PaX userland components in Gentoo - which 
quickly resulted in an invitation to join the development team. He has 
also worked on implementing toolchains for non-x86 platforms like 
PA-RISC[15]. He works with a computer menagerie that includes routers, 
pa-risc workstations, vaxen, and Intel-based machines. He prefers 
Evolution[16], Afterstep[17] and several xterms for his working 
environment.

During the day, Alexander works for EDS as a field service engineer, a 
position he describes as "driving around and replacing power supplies and 
hard disks". He lives in a small town outside Munich, Germany, where he 
has recently moved into a house that is now populated with computers, 
children, a new wife and an aging electrical system. He entered the 
computer industry directly after finishing secondary school and German 
military service. His non-computer-related pastimes include playing chess, 
basketball, roller-blading, and playing with his children. Alexander 
offered his view on some recent controversies in the community: "We are 
working on a freely available, open-source operating system ... There is 
something that seems to be missing when lawyers carrying suitcases full of 
printouts walk into courtrooms to fight about it." A slightly sanitized 
version of his favorite quote would read "fighting for peace is like 
making love for virginity."

Gentoo and Commercial Support 
 
Given the semi-random nature of a "meta-distribution" package, some users 
attempting to install commercial Linux software on Gentoo have run into 
some roadblocks. In this[18] case, a user attempting to install 
Codeweaver's CrossoverOffice has some interesting comments from one of the 
company's founders.

Italy: Gentoo Pub in Milano on 6 March 2004
 
There was a test run for a Gentoo Milano Meeting on 28 February of unknown 
success at the time of this writing, but whatever the outcome of it was: 
Next Saturday, the Gentooista residents of Milano in Northern Italy will 
meet at the entrance to Garibaldi station (and spontaneously decide where 
to get fed and watered, no doubt). If you want to join them, be there at 
18:15 hours sharp on Saturday, 6 March 2004. Coordination thread at 
forums.gentoo.org, right here[19] (in Italian).

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Recovering the root password
 
This week's tip shows you a couple of ways to reset the root password if 
you've forgotten it. 
 
The easiest way is of course to boot off the Gentoo LiveCD, chroot into 
the primary hard disk as described in the Gentoo Install Guide and use 
passwd. 
 
If you don't have a LiveCD, or the system doesn't have CDROM drive, you 
can reboot the system into single user mode to reset the password. Simply 
pass the options "init=/bin/sh" to the kernel from the bootloader menu. 
When the system boots it will drop you into a root shell. The disk will be 
mounted read-only so remount it read-write with mount -o rw,remount 
/dev/ROOT (be sure to change ROOT to your actual root partition). Edit 
/etc/shadow and remove the encrypted password. Reset the root password 
with passwd and reboot the system.
 
You should now be able to login with the new password.
