Hardware failures on Oregon State mirror
----------------------------------------
  
On Friday, the server that hosts gentoo.oregonstate.edu suffered two hard 
disk failures in its RAID 5 array, one of which was unfortunately the hot 
spare. This caused a series of problems, including a number of corrupted 
files and bad digests. We are actively working with the folks at OSU to 
resolve the problem, both in the short term as well as the long term. In 
the mean time, users are asked to use an alternate mirror[1] until the 
problem has been fully resolved.

Gentoo Linux is seeking developers for the GNOME team
-----------------------------------------------------
  
The Gentoo GNOME Desktop team is looking for new developers to help squash 
bugs and keep the Gentoo GNOME-related ebuilds on the bleeding edge of 
development. We are looking for dedicated developers, preferably with 
experience in developing for GNOME/GTK, some experience in creating 
ebuilds and solid problem solving capabilities. A plus would be experience 
in the area of accessibility, possibly in combination with GNOME. Most of 
all we're looking for people who stand completely behind the current GNOME 
development philosophy. If you think you got what it takes and can help us 
out then please send a resume to Marinus Schraal[2], explain why you would 
like to be part of the team, include references to work you've done on OSS 
and provide us with your bugzilla email address if possible.

Gentoo Linux in the news
------------------------
  
Gentoo Linux has been generating some good press of late, with a mention 
on Slashdot[3] discussing our intent to port Gentoo Linux to the AMD 
Opteron platform. Additionally, Gentoo Linux received a favorable 
review[4] from LinuxWorld.com, where the author states, "[U]ntil further 
notice, Gentoo is now my flavor of Linux."

GLSA: cdrtools
--------------
  
cdrecord contains a format string vulnerability that could permit the 
execution of arbitrary code. 
 
 * Severity: High - Arbitrary code execution. 
 * Packages Affected:
 * app-cdr/cdrtools prior to cdrtools-1.11.33-r1 (xcdroast users) 
 * app-cdr/cdrtools prior to cdrtools-1.11.39-r1 (sparc)

GLSA: ut2003-demo
-----------------
  
The Unreal Tournament game demo has a bug in how it handles spoofed 
negative index values. This could permit a denial of service attack on the 
client. 
 
The security fix for this bug caused problems with the game itself. As 
such, it has been removed in -r2 of the ebuild until a better patch can be 
integrated. 
 
 * Severity: Moderate - DoS. 
 * Packages Affected: app-games/ut2003-demo prior to ut2003-demo-2206-r1

3. User stories
===============
  
Mathy and lanzone.be
 
Mathy Vanvoorden[16] from Belgium organizes LAN parties together with his 
brother and some other people. He is the webmaster of lanzone.be[17] 
(where he also did the HTML and PHP coding) and politics.be[18]. A few 
months ago the LANzone team decided to switch all their gameservers to 
Gentoo Linux (except for Delta Force Land Warrior, which only runs on 
Windows) and now we're going to learn about the tricks involved:

 16. matje@lanzone.be
 17. http://www.lanzone.be
 18. http://www.politics.be
 
Avoiding backaches
 
All of Mathy's gameservers are thin clients which boot from a Dual Pentium 
III. This setup has many benefits over regular servers. Firstly they don't 
need any hard drives, which saves money and leads to lighter servers which 
is really nice for the backs of the people carrying them. :-) But the 
greatest advantage is the easiness of hooking up a new game server: just 
plug in two network cards, set the MAC adress in dhcpd so the machine gets 
a static IP adress, copy a base directory and have fun!
 
Details on the thin clients
 
The setup used by Mathy and his friends is slightly based on the Linux 
Terminal Server Project[19] but evolved beyond that. Although they are 
using the project's kernel patch, the initrd script has already been 
modified and lots of changes were made to the Gentoo Linux init scripts 
(e.g. removing dependencies so that init wouldn't try to fsck mounted NFS 
systems).

 19. http://www.ltsp.org
 
Using these thin clients is very easy: they are connected to the main 
server using a 100 MBit switch and boot from a floppy (although the 
LANzone guys are thinking about buying network cards with boot roms so 
they can get rid of the disk drives which would be even better for their 
backs ;-). After booting they just present a regular login. Based on which 
user one enters a gameserver will be started. This is accomplished by 
replacing the login shells with a script that starts up the server. So for 
example login in using the UID 'ut2k3instadm' will bring up an UT 2003 
Instagib deathmatch server.
 
Final words
 
Many other small adaptations had to been done for specific gameservers, 
but this would go to far to be covered here. As a last note, LANzone also 
uses Gentoo Linux for the 0.5 Terabyte FTP server (running ProFTPD[20]) 
and the router (using iptables[21] and Squid[22] to limit incoming traffic 
to 5 kB/s per user), although Mathy's thinking about switching the router 
to a BSD because he heard that they handle traffic shaping better than 
Linux and he's curious about trying it out.

Gnome 2.3.2
 
Forum veteran Lovechild[23] started a thread announcing the ebuild he 
concocted mere minutes after the new Gnome version was published, and ever 
since then the band of Gnome fanatics in the forums has been merrily 
patching and tweaking it to almost stable use. Get carried away by the 
enthusiasm in this thread:

When Portage Chokes
 
You'd expect critical alerts on bugs.gentoo.org or the mailing lists 
first, but whenever something affects a large number of people, many of 
them look to the Forums as the main emergency alert mechanism. Last week, 
Oregon State University's rsync server had temporary trouble that 
immediately got spotted by a lot of users. Check the sticky thread for an 
instant workaround in cases like this:

JRE Support - Is it worth it?
 
It has been brought up that there might be a couple of good reasons to 
remove the Java Runtime Envirronment (JRE) support from Gentoo. Read the

Gentoo Poland Established
 
Their URL[27] points to more than just Poland as a base, but it's essentially
for their compatriots here and there and everywhere that the Polish Gentooists
busied themselves with setting up a complete Gentoo Poland framework. Started
by a handful of activists a few weeks ago, the #gentoo-pl IRC channel on
irc.freenode.net is now quite popular, and the very well organized website has
made great progress in providing translations of the Gentoo documentation, a
forum of their own, and many other features. And to round it all up, the group
around Jaroslaw Swierad is currently bringing together enough translators to
work on a Polish version of the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter, too.

German Gentoo User Meeting Planning
 
A small group of Gentoo Linux users, led by Gentoo developer Sascha 
Schwabbauer and Gentoo Linux user Tilman Klar, have started an effort to 
put together a German Gentoo User Meeting. As part of the effort, Sascha 
has put up a web page[29] that asks German Gentoo Linux users where they 
live. The responses to this survey will determine where the meeting will 
be held. Anyone interested in attending is invited to input their location 
using the above form.

Additional details about the German Gentoo Linux user meeting will be made 
available in future editions of the GWN.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Blocking Spam with bogofilter
 
While we've already had one tip on blocking spam with SpamAssassin, this 
week we look at another way to block spam using bogofilter (available in 
portage), crontab and Evolution. This example uses MH style mailboxes but 
could be extended to other types as well. 

This week's tip was submitted by John Mylchreest[120].

You will need bogofilter and a mail client that reads MH style mailboxes 
such as mutt or Evolution. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.1:                                                       |
| Installing bogofilter                                                   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# emerge bogofilter                                                      |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Create a folder called SPAM and mark it as MH format. Additionally, mark 
Inbox as MH format. 
 
Add a filter for incoming mail that pipes to a shell command. The shell 
command should be /usr/bin/bogofilter. Set the return condition to 0 and 
set the action as "Move to Folder SPAM". Add another action to this filter 
called "Stop Processing". 

Create another filter than runs after the first one. This filter should 
have two criteria. The first is that Size should be greater than 0. The 
second is another external pipe; this time to /usr/bin/bogofilter -Sn 
(notice the -Sn). The -Sn option tells bogofilter to register the text as 
non-spam and to undo any prior registrations of the message as spam. 
 
The last step is to set up a crontab to evaluate spam messages. Add the 
following to your crontab with crontab -e. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.2:                                                       |
| crontab                                                                 |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                         |
|Go through the SPAM folder and learn what spam looks like                |
|0 0 * * * cd ~/evolution/local/SPAM/mbox/ ; for i in *; do if \          |
|[ ! "$i" = "*" ] ; then /usr/bin/bogofilter -Ns < $i ; \                 |
|rm $i ; fi ; done                                                        |
|Go through the Inbox folder and learn what spam is not.                  |
|5 0 * * * cd ~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox/; for i in *; do if \          |
|[ ! "$i" = "*" ] ; then /usr/bin/bogofilter -Sn < $i ; fi ; done         |
|                                                                         |
