Gentoo Linux Chief Architect Daniel Robbins retires
---------------------------------------------------
  
(this article was contributed by developer Grant Goodyear[1])

Unless you have been living under a rock you already know that this week 
Daniel Robbins resigned from as Gentoo Linux Chief Architect. Gentoo will 
be continuing on as a newly created Not-for-Profit organization, but 
before Daniel moves on for good I would like to take a bit of time to 
acknowledge some of drobbins' many, many accomplishments during his 
stewardship of Gentoo. 
 
Figure 1.1: Gentoo site in May 2001

Daniel Robbins got his start in Linux distribution developing as a 
developer with Stampede Linux before leaving to found Enoch Linux, which 
later became Gentoo Linux. (You can read some of the history of this 
period in drobbins'  "Making the Distribution"[2] series). I'm not sure 
exactly when Gentoo was born, but checking the wayback machine[3] one can 
find an archived Gentoo website from July 2000. It is interesting to note 
that although Gentoo did (and probably still does) contain some elements 
from Stampede, it can't really be considered a fork because Gentoo was 
pretty much created from scratch.

I joined Gentoo Linux sometime in early 2001. At that time Gentoo was 
still pretty much in its infancy, but it was usable. There were only a 
dozen or so developers, all packages had to be installed using the ebuild 
command because emerge had not yet been written, and the online bugs 
database was the gentoo-dev mailing list. Even at that early stage, 
however, one could see many of drobbins' design decisions that have 
carried on to present-day Gentoo. The use of source-based packages meant 
that the familiar (especially at that time) RPM dependency nightmare of 
not having precisely the right library version installed would go away. 
The decision to eschew *BSD's make-based ports system in favor of one 
based on bash and python made package creation almost ridiculously simple, 
which meant that anybody could contribute a reasonable ebuild. The 
flexibility inherent to configure scripts was encoded as USE variables. 
Flexibility, in fact, had become a guiding principle underlying Gentoo, 
which explains why the Gentoo base system is deliberately minimal, and 
customizable before installation. Indeed, one strong difference between 
the *BSD ports system and Gentoo's portage is the fact that Gentoo makes 
no distinction between the core system and the ports/packages. Gentoo was 
remarkably short-handed in the early days, so all Gentoo-specific tools 
were designed to be scriptable (which is why ebuild and emerge, unlike 
Debian's dselect, do not ask questions of the user). Drobbins had thus 
invented the "metadistribution". He did have some very talented help, 
including Achim Gottinger who was an ebuild-writing machine, but it seems 
to have been mainly Daniel's vision that created and maintained these 
design decisions. 
 
Besides serving as Gentoo visionary, drobbins also did a lot of darn hard 
work on the the distribution. Until the last year or so Daniel was the 
lead, and sometimes only, portage developer. Not only did drobbins design 
the current www.gentoo.org[4] website, but he also wrote the underlying  
guide xml[5] along with an xsl tranform to process it. Drobbins, along 
with Azarah, created the necessary support for Gentoo to be the first 
distribution to use devfs by default. (Incidentally, thanks to Azarah's 
hard work Gentoo was also the first distribution to have complete support 
for udev.) A collaboration between drobbins and Azarah led to Gentoo being 
the first (only?) distribution to use need-based init scripts instead of 
the more common numbered system-V scripts. (I have vague recollections of 
drobbins and Azarah spending a notable amount of time discussing how to 
implement the new dependency-based init scripts, but I don't remember who 
actually initiated the project.) Drobbins and zhen designed and 
implemented catalyst[6], the new Gentoo stage and livecd creation script. 
In his copious spare time drobbins wrote or modified a substantial number 
of the ebuilds in the portage tree. I'm sure that I'm missing quite a host 
of accomplishments, but suffice it to say that he's been a rather busy 
guy.

Aside from all of the technical stuff, drobbins also presided over the 
expansion of Gentoo from a handful of developers and tens of users to the 
current distribution of hundreds of developers and untold thousands of 
users, much of which seemed to happen virtually overnight. So Daniel 
Robbins became a manager. No longer was it sufficient to manage simply by 
hanging out in #gentoo-dev on irc.freenode.net. He now had to think 
strategically, and organize teams of people to work on projects. Most of 
all he had to delegate, while learning to manage fractious developers. It 
was not an easy transition, and Gentoo has had its share of high-profile 
developer clashes and defections, but Gentoo now has a set of organized 
top-level projects, with people to lead them, and a new Not-for-Profit on 
the horizon. Along the way drobbins grew into his new role quite 
impressively. 
 
Now Daniel Robbins has decided that it is time to move on to something 
new. I, personally, am sad to see him go, but I understand the need. 
Daniel, I have learned an astounding amount from you over the last several 
years; thank you very much. Best wishes, and please do keep in touch! 
    
10th BugDay a big success
-------------------------
  
(this article was contributed by developer Bryan Ostergaard[7])

 7. kloeri@gentoo.org
 
Saturday May 1st, saw the tenth BugDay. Once again it was a big success 
with many users as well as developers testing and fixing bugs. I'm not 
sure if it's an all time high but I like to report that during the BugDay 
timeframe more than 220 bugs was closed in bugzilla.
 
I also asked one user to join the team of developers and spotted a few 
other potential developers.
 
Finally I'd like to thank all BugDay participants for making this such a 
great event - this wouldn't be possible without a strong and thriving 
community.

Farewell to drobbins 
 
In a wave of sympathy washing over the Forum upon the news of Daniel 
Robbins' departure from the Gentoo project, the Forum community has been 
busy to say goodbye, and raking together the funds for sort of a 
going-away present, by donating to cover some of the losses drobbins has 
made over time:

Running Faketoo... 
 
If their Forum postcount had anything to do with how guruesque people are, 
Josh Glover[13] wouldn't score too high. Fortunately, numbers aren't all 
that counts. Last week, Josh volunteered instructions for running Gentoo 
instances in a chroot jail - a Faketoo installation, in a manner of 
speaking - for development purposes, and provoked a lively discussion of 
his method's vices and virtues. See his Captain's log, a script to enter 
the jail, and the debate in the Documentation, Tips & Tricks forum:
