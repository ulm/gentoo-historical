If you are one of the winners or have received an honorable mention, 
please contact Daniel Robbins[20] and make sure that he has your mailing 
address. If you're a winner, then we need to determine what hardware you 
should receive. Daniel has decided not to purchase the prize hardware 
components in advance so that winners can suggest or request components 
they may need.

2. Featured Developer of the Week

Olivier Crête

http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20040112_tester.jpg
 
This week, we are featuring Olivier Crête[21] (tester), a Montréal 
resident who is currently spending a year in Europe. Olivier is on the 
AMD64 project, maintains a few packages that would otherwise have been 
abandoned, and is working on some of the Adelie Linux[22] clustering 
enhancements to Gentoo. He is also co-maintainer of GnomeICU[23], a 
Gnome-based ICQ client.

 23. http://gnomeicu.sourceforge.net/index.php
 
Olivier has been using Linux since 1997, progressing from RedHat 4.2 
through 7.3 before the brand-new laptop he acquired in early-2002 caused 
him to look around for a distro that could be optimized for his new 
hardware. He has been on Gentoo ever since, largely because he "found the 
Gentoo forums to be really helpful, and the Gentoo community was 
wonderful". The next summer, he was employed at Cyberlogic[24], a Montreal 
company providing computers and support services, including clustering. 
One of the projects he worked on there was Adelie Linux,using Gentoo as 
the foundation for clustering, including AMD Opteron-based clusters. 
Cyberlogic was very supportive of their staff pursuing an AMD64 version of 
Gentoo, and Olivier worked with Daniel Robbins[25] and others to start 
making it a reality. In particular, Olivier noted that Brad House[26], the 
current Gentoo AMD64 Project[27] lead, "is doing a tremendous job and the 
AMD64 port would not be anywhere near where it is without his 
contribution."

A third-year Software Engineering Student at the Canadian École 
Polytechnique de Montréal[28], Olivier is currently studying as an 
exchange student at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique et de 
Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble (ENSIMAG)[29] in France He enjoys 
traveling, and you can read about his adventures (in French) on his 
blog[30]. He is currently working on a Dell Inspiron Laptop, and (as a 
Gnome Developer) he uses Gnome[31] 2.4. He recently abandoned Pine[32] in 
favor of Evolution[33] for email, and counts Mozilla Firebird[34], 
xchat[35], Gossip[36], Amsn[37] and aterm[38] among his most oft-used 
applications. Democratically, he uses GNU Emacs[39] for development, and 
vi[40] for general editing.

Olivier closed our correspondence with the following observation: "What I 
really like about Gentoo is not only that its a great distribution from a 
technical point of view, but that it has a great community. The life and 
blood of a Free Software project is in its community, and Gentoo has one 
of the best communities that I have been part of." His favorite quote was 
from Henry Spencer: "Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to 
reinvent it, poorly." 
   
==================
3. Gentoo Security
==================
  
GLSA: Linux kernel do_mremap() privilege escalation vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  
A critical security vulnerability has been found in recent Linux kernels 
which allows for local privilege escalation. Arbitrary code may be able to 
exploit this vulnerability and may disrupt the operation of other parts of 
the kernel memory management subroutines finally leading to unexpected 
behavior.
 
Since no special privileges are required to use the mremap() system call 
any process may misuse its unexpected behavior to disrupt the kernel 
memory management subsystem. Proper exploitation of this vulnerability may 
lead to local privilege escalation including execution of arbitrary code 
with kernel level access. Proof-of-concept exploit code has been created 
and successfully tested, permitting root escalation on vulnerable systems. 
As a result, all users should upgrade their kernels to new or patched 
versions.
 
There is no temporary workaround - a kernel upgrade is required. A list of 
unaffected kernels is provided in the GLSA announcement[41].

 * Severity: High 
 * Packages Affected: see GLSA announcement[42] 
 * Rectification: emerge sync; emerge -pv your-favorite-sources; emerge 
your-favorite-sources; follow usual procedures for compiling and 
installing a kernel. 
 * GLSA Announcement[43]

Greet the Repoman
 
Genone[44] is among those Gentoo developers with more than just occasional 
guest appearances in the Forums. Last week he put up a post describing the 
characteristics of an upcoming Portage version 2.0.50, which has quickly 
developed in a lively thread discussing the advantages of new and improved 
features, but also points out possible hickups other tools like etcat 
might run into if they're used in conjunction with the new Portage:

Stuck Between An ~ARCH and A Hard Place 
 
For the moderators, the sudden outbreak of complaints about kdelibs-3.1.4 
compiles ending rather abruptly on peculiar error messages was hard to 
contain, particularly because many people seem to panic and forget about 
the Forum's search function. After a biug @urge of duplicates, only one 
thread remained alive. Luckily, Gentoo dev Caleb[46] had both that Forum 
thread and the corresponding bug report[47] in his focus and provided a 
temporary solution (update autoconf to a release number beyond "x86" 
stable) within a very decent response time. Anyway, the actual error is on 
its way out as soon as autoconf-2.58 is bumped to usability for people not 
living on the bleeding ~x86 edge:

DJBDNS and Gentoo 
 
DJBDNS[49] is a popular alternative to the traditional and sometimes buggy 
BIND[50] package from ISC. This[51] thread covers some basics of getting 
DJBDNS up and running on Gentoo.

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Forwarding an SSH agent
 
This weeks tip shows you how to forward ssh sessions between hosts so you 
don't have to copy private keys between hosts. 
 
Note:  Remote SSH sessions and public keys are covered in the Keychain 
documentation. 
 
If you're using remote sessions with public key authentication you are 
probably used to logging into remote hosts without having to retype your 
password. So logging into Host B from Host A and logging into Host C from 
Host A works great. But what if you need to login to Host C from Host B 
(e.g. to use scp or rsync). Instead of copying your private key from Host 
A to Host B, SSH has a configuration flag you can use. 
 
This flag is called ForwardAgent and it will forward you ssh-agent process 
from Host A to Host B so that you can use the same authentication from 
Host B to Host C without copying your private SSH key. 
 
To enable ssh-agent forwarding, set ForwardAgent yes in either .ssh/config 
or /etc/ssh/ssh_config. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 7.1:                                                       |
| /etc/ssh/ssh_config                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Host *                                                                   |
|  ForwardAgent  yes                                                      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now you can ssh from Host A to Host B and ssh or scp to Host C using the 
authentication information from Host A.
