<p><b>The future of the bugday project.</b></p>

<p>
As most of you know the bugday project is a fast growing project which helps
users to get involved with gentoo (e.g. by helping them on how to fix bugs,
helping each other <e>and having fun</e>).
</p>

<p>
The Bugdayteam is currently going through a lot of changes. They are currently
going through a lot of changes which involves:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Bugday helpers.<br />This is a new term which will allow users to help out
  with arranging bugdays together with the team. They will receive a special
  bugday helper cloak for their IRC account and should be available to help
  fellow users at bugdays.
  <br />
  The helpers should be the man-in-the-middle between the bugday in our users
  and will later on be a key player on the idea of moving the bugday project to
  be completely users driven, except the infrastructure hosting.
  </li>
  <li>
  Social Bugdays<br />
  The bugday team are going to make some documents about how to start making
  social bugdays in your local linux user group. The documents should describe
  briefly describe how to arrange the bugdays; what do you need to make sure
  you have and so on.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you would like to contribute, join them on irc at their channel
<uri>irc://irc.freenode.org/#gentoo-bugs</uri>

<p><b>64bit PS3 stage4 released to Gentoo mirrors</b></p>

<p>
This week ranger wrote at his blog about the amazing work the PPC64 team is
doing with Gentoo-On-PS3. They have currently made PS3-livecd with support for
64bit-userland and 32bit-userland stage4 installations (which both run an 64bit
kernel). Other than that, they have 32bit and 64bit GRP online Toolchains which
are maturing to take further advantage of the Cell processor. In short, it's a
viable desktop machine for email, browsing, music, office work, and much more.
</p>

<p>
This week the <uri link="http://lca2007.linux.org.au/">linux conf
australia</uri> is being held at Sydney. <mail link="dostrow@gentoo.org">Daniel
Ostrow</mail> is attending for gentoo, where he is going to hilight PS3 and
Gentoo.

<title>Belgium: #Gentoo-nl LAN, Arendonk</title>
<body>

<p>
Dutch Documentation Lead <mail link="diox@gentoo.org">Dimitry Bradt</mail> and
other members of the Dutch community have organised a LAN party last weekend
to celebrate the start of the new year. Because the location itself was between
Antwerpen and Eindhoven (right at the border), a lot of people joined up the
dutch conspiracy. At the lan they enjoyed Quake3, worms3d and weird enough
ksudoku. Other than that they've written an interface to control the sound
system there, and off course drank a lot of belgian beers.
</p>

<p>
Among the visitors, there was an international guest present, namely: Gentoo
developer <mail link="nattfodd@gentoo.org">Alexander Buisse</mail>. His
impressions after the event also went to the good belgian beer.
</p>

<p>
You can find some pictures at their <uri

you all at Fosdem <e>;-)</e>.

<p>
This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri
link="/proj/en/qa/treecleaners">Treecleaners</uri> and various developers. Most
packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
