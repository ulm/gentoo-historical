"Apple, we have a problem" - Gentoo MacOS X Released 
 
Figure 1.1: Derived from Apple's 'Redmond, we have a problem' campaign: 
The Gentoo MacOS announcement

Almost exactly one year after the idea of porting Portage to MacOS X came 
up - and the joint Metapkg initiative[1] between Fink, Darwinports and 
Gentoo took off - a 20-head-strong developer team around Pieter van den 
Abeele[2] (strategic lead) and Daniel Ostrow[3] (operational) is now ready 
to release an extraordinary beast into the wild: Gentoo MacOS. They 
deliver on a promise no other Linux distribution has been daring enough to 
make yet: Portage on MacOS is now fully operational, seamlessly integrated 
as a package manager in a non-Linux operating system. It initially serves 
the main purpose of an SDK for inclusion of new packages, testing and 
patching. Granted, KDE isn't ported yet, but make no mistake: Gentoo MacOS 
is ready for consumption by Macintosh users who want, say, scientific DTP 
via TeX, something they will now be able to simply emerge in OS X just 
like they'd do in Gentoo Linux."Right now it's a tool to install lots of 
commonly requested applications on OS X", explains Pieter van den Abeele. 
"But in a few months, we'll have a port system that builds Darwin from 
scratch, provides a standardised lookup and installation routine for 
Dashboard widgets[4], enhancements and tools like the Desktop Manager[5] 
and many, many more popular OS X applications." Downloading the Gentoo 
MacOS Installer provides users with a patched portage, its tree, and the 
Python modules. It sets environment variables and demands a bootstrapping 
shell script to be run before the first emerge that detects the operating 
system (Panther or Tiger), chooses the relevant profiles and injects every 
application it finds already installed in MacOS X.

Since Gentoo's own GCC ebuild for MacOS X isn't ready yet, compiling is 
currently done using the Xcode development tools[6] which include GCC 3.3 
provided by Apple. "People already on Tiger can experiment with GCC 3.5", 
adds Pieter. Tiger, the new release of MacOS X, is due in 2005 with its 
brandnew database filesystem Spotlight[7], modernised video services and 
many other features. The Gentoo MacOS developers are busy polishing the 
knobs (a Cocoa user interface is part of the plan), getting iSync[8] 
integration to work (emerge an application on one machine, automatically 
replicate onto all other Macs in a LAN), right down to making Catalyst 
produce Darwin LiveCDs... "But first the cool stuff, then Darwin", 
chuckles strategic lead Pieter. Even though his team is already larger 
than the entire Gentoo Linux PPC developer group, they still train new 
devs almost daily, and whoever wants to help with the project is very 
welcome to get in touch. The public Wiki[9] holds installation 
instructions and serves as a reporting tool for packages outside of 
Portage that already compile without bombing out. The Gentoo MacOS 
Installer can be downloaded from here[10].

2. Gentoo Security
==================
  
rsync: Directory traversal in rsync daemon
------------------------------------------
  
Under specific conditions, the rsync daemon is vulnerable to a directory 
traversal allowing to write files outside a sync module. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[20] 

 20. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200407-10.xml
    
wv: Buffer overflow vulnerability
---------------------------------
  
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the wv library that can allow an 
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running 
the vulnerable application. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[21] 

 21. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200407-11.xml
    
Linux Kernel: Remote DoS vulnerability with IPTables TCP Handling
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  
A flaw has been discovered in 2.6 series Linux kernels that allows an 
attacker to send a malformed TCP packet, causing the affected kernel to 
possibly enter an infinite loop and hang the vulnerable machine. 
 
For more information, please see the GLSA Announcement[22] 

 22. http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200407-12.xml
    
PHP: Multiple security vulnerabilities
--------------------------------------
  
Multiple security vulnerabilities, potentially allowing remote code 
execution, were found and fixed in PHP.

3. Projects Update
==================
   
Portage
 
The portage team is currently working on readying portage-2.0.51 for 
public testing and stable releases in the near future. The features of 
2.0.51 are mostly internal, but there will be some obvious changes related 
to FHS compliance and better handling of virtual and 'any of these' 
dependencies. There will be some changes in the caches as the migration to 
2.0.51 starts, but as long as users are currently on at least 
portage-2.0.50-r7, they won't notice. 
 
Devrel
 
The recruiters team have suspended plans to implement a formal copyright 
assignment process, pending legal counsel and some issues with wording, 
the status of developers younger than the age of majority, and the legal 
status of non-U.S. development. For now, ebuilds are specifically assigned 
copyright to the Gentoo Foundation, but there is no formal contract. There 
is also now a Developer Away[24] page which will document developers who 
are away or out-of-contact for a variety of reasons. 

 24. http://dev.gentoo.org/devaway/
 
Gentoo-Alt
 
Pieter van den Abeele[25] (strategic lead) and Daniel Ostrow[26] 
(operational) will be heading up the new MacOS[27] project to support the 
implementation of portage on Macintosh computers. See the News section for 
details on this initiative.

Hardened
 
The Hardened Gentoo team is currently getting ready for a parallel release 
with the 2004.2 Live CD. 
 
Infrastructure
 
The infrastructure team are currently testing eGroupWare[28]'s suitability 
for use by Gentoo developers for communication and project management.

Releng
 
The Release Engineering team are hard at work gearing up for the release 
of the 2004.2[29] Live CD,currently scheduled for the 26th of this month.

Portage, not Portage 
 
First anniversary of one of the most popular threads in the forums: Gentoo 
developer Pythonhead started a list of portage utilities that aren't in 
Portage exactly a year ago that's been spoon-fed with suggestions by many 
users since then. The list is constantly updated and has grown to 
currently 37 tools, including esoteric shell script like license2kill 
(gets rid of every package not covered by an 
Open-Source-Initiative-approved license) and hands-on helpers like 
Pythonhead's own "bumper" (bumps ebuilds when a new source version is 
available for download and doesn't require a totally modified ebuild) and 
a handful of replacements or modifications of standard portage features 
like updating config files, downloading and emerging things. Some of the 
tools have actually made it into Portage already, some will never stand a 
chance of inclusion in the tree. Take your pick:

Using ~x86 All the Time?
 
Should you use the ~x86 flag for everything on your system? Some claim it 
is too unstable, and others claim that it is more stable than not setting 
any keywords. Check out the interesting arguments both ways in this[31] 
thread.

Gentoo-Sources
 
What is your opinion on using gentoo-sources for the kernel? A few people 
believe that there are too many patches applied in the gentoo-kernel, but 
there are also good arguments for them as well. The thread is here[32].

UK: Gentoo Meet-Up Looking for Organizing Committee 
 
Gentoo developer Stuart Herbert[34] is seeking volunteers who would be 
willing to organize a meeting for UK-based Gentoo developers and users in 
September or early October 2004. The initial venue is to be Manchester, 
conveniently placed at the geographic center of England, Wales and 
Scotland. Help is now needed to organize a venue, internet access, 
accomodation and the conference programme, along with publicity around the 
event. If you're interested in participating, post your availability to 
this thread[35] on the Forums.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Using bash history
 
If you have ever typed a long command and needed to repeat it, or you need 
to repeat a series of commands, try using history instead of re-typing. 
The history command allows you see (and execute) previous commands. Type 
history to see the last few commands you've entered. It will show you the 
command and a number. To execute the command use history !number where 
number is the number of the command listed. (e.g. history !234).
