BugDay on Saturday, October 4
-----------------------------
  
The third Gentoo BugDay will be held this Saturday, October 4th. Come down 
to the #gentoo-bugs channel in irc.freenode.net to work with Gentoo Linux 
developers and help take a chunk out of the bugs in the distribution. 
    
Featured Sponsor - Oregon State University
------------------------------------------
  
Gentoo Linux relies heavily on its sponsors to provide everything from 
bandwidth to hardware to technical expertise. Without these sponsors, 
Gentoo Linux would not be able to provide the level of service that it 
does today. In an effort to raise awareness of our sponsors and their 
businesses and services, we will occasionally be featuring them in the 
Gentoo Weekly Newsletter. Our inaugural Featured Sponsor is also our most 
important sponsor: Oregon State University.
 
Located in Corvallis, Oregon, Oregon State University[1] is 80 miles south 
of Portland. OSU is Oregon's land grant, sea grant and space grant 
university, with nearly 20,000 students from all 50 states and more than 
80 countries.

Earlier this year, OSU was approached by Gentoo about hosting 
opportunities. In an effort to give back to the community that has helped 
us all out so much they offered rack space and bandwidth for a couple of 
machines. OSU now hosts the forums, database, CVS and the primary distfile 
mirror for Gentoo. Gentoo currently uses well over 400GB of outbound 
bandwidth per day from OSU (peaking at 1TB during the release of 1.4).

Scott Kveton[2] from Oregon State University[3] has been pivotal in making 
the Gentoo and other hosting opportunities happen.

"OSU is trying to do its part for the open source community. We're a large 
shop that uses open source almost exclusively in our environments" said 
Kveton.
 
"The State of Oregon itself is a very progressive place. The OSDL is here 
(Open Source Development Lab) and we've even had several bills making 
their way through our state legislature about the use of open source in 
government. We're trying to take it a step further and create a place for 
open source developers to house their projects for the rest of the world."
 
In addition to Gentoo, OSU hosts several other projects:
 
 * Ark Linux[4] 
 * Zynot Foundation[5] 
 * Freenode.net[6] (zelazny.freenode.net) 
 * Software in the Public Interest[7]

OSU will soon be hosting pieces of the Debian GNU/Linux[8], Free Software 
Foundation[9] and Mozilla.org[10] infrastructure.

Oregon State University[11] is well on the way to being known as the home 
of hosting for open source development. For more information on hosting 
opportunities please visit the OSS @ Oregon State University pages.[12]

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Joachim Blaabjerg
 
Figure 3.1: Joachim Blaabjerg
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20030929_styx.jpg
 
This week's featured developer is Joachim Blaabjerg[17] (styx), who 
describes his work as "a grunt developer" on security-related issues and 
occasional forays into the kernel. Joachim first began using Linux in 
early 2000, moving from Red Hat through Slackware, Debian, Trustix and 
Mandrake before settling on Linux From Scratch. That was, of course, 
before he discovered Gentoo, which he migrated to in February of 2002. He 
became a developer rather quickly - being named to the rolls that April. 
He has not been very active for the last few months, but hopes to rectify 
that in the near future. 

 17. styx@gentoo.org
 
Joachim has a fair bit of Linux development experience. He worked on his 
own security-focused Linux distro (SuxOS) for much of 2001 and 2002 before 
abandoning the work in 2002 due to the daunting size of the project. He 
has also been working on his own HTTP server while contributing to 
open-source security projects like WOLK[18] and LIDS[19]. He even 
maintained his own kernel patch series for some time, and has contributed 
patches and bug-fixes to a number of other projects. He is most proud of 
his work on the XFS sources for Gentoo, and the work he did with Michael 
Cohen[20] on other Gentoo kernels. This is somewhat impressive if we note 
that Joachim is a high-school student who turned 18 the day before this 
publication. 

 18. http://sourceforge.net/projects/wolk
 19. http://www.lids.org/
 20. mjc@gentoo.org
 
Joachim uses vim for editing; gcc bash, and cvs for development; and 
irssi, nc, ssh and pig for communication. He is a KDE aficionado, and uses 
Konsole, KMail,Konqueror and KNode extensively. He currently owns three 
computers: an AthlonXP(2000+, 512MB) development box named Elysium, a DEC 
3000 (64-bit Alpha 175 MHz, 32MB) server that goes by Zaphod and 
Methuselah, a Sun SparcStation LX (MicroSparc 50 MHz, 64 MB) that is 
running a somewhat lethargic Gentoo. 
 
Joachim lives in Oslo, Norway, and currently works in a warehouse, but 
hinted broadly that he would certainly consider a Unix-related job (if 
only to free up more time to work on Gentoo) if it were offered. He is 
single, and enjoys cars, music, movies, going out with friends and working 
out. The favorite quote he offers is Benjamin Franklin's "Beer is proof 
that God loves us and wants us to be happy.".

Yahoo Blocks Instant Messaging 
 
Gentoo users were not immune to the recent Yahoo move to block third party 
instant messengers from using their service. Will Gaim be patched to fix 
it? Check it out  here [21] .

Measuring Network Metrics 
 
Ever wonder how fast your cable modem really gets? Internet-based 
calculators for download are immensely innaccurate. Some suggestions for 
Linux-based tools were  discussed [22] this week.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Using netstat
 
This week's tip demonstrates some useful applications of the netstat 
command. Netstat is a command used to print out a list of network 
connections, routing tables, and other statistics related to networking. 
 
Just typing netstat should display a long list of information that's 
usually more than you want to go through at any given time. The trick to 
keeping the information useful is knowing what you're looking for and how 
to tell netstat to only display that information. 
 
For example, if you only want to see TCP connections, use netstat --tcp. 
This shows a list of TCP connections to and from your machine. The 
following example shows connections to our machine on ports 993 (imaps), 
143 (imap), 110 (pop3), 25 (smtp), and 22 (ssh). It also shows a 
connection from our machine to a remote machine on port 389 (ldap). 
 
Note:  To speed things up you can use the --numeric option to avoid having 
to do name resolution on addresses and display the IP only.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
If you want to see what (TCP) ports your machine is listening on, use 
netstat --tcp --listening. Another useful flag to add to this is 
--programs which indicates which process is listening on the specified 
port. The following example shows a machine listening on ports 80 (www), 
443 (https), 22 (ssh), and 25 (smtp); 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Note:  Using --all displays both connections and listening ports. 
 
The next example uses netstat --route to display the routing table. For 
most people, this will show one IP and and the gateway address but if you 
have more than one interface or have multiple IPs assigned to an 
interface, this command can help troubleshoot network routing problems. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The last example of netstat uses the --statistics flag to display 
networking statistics. Using this flag by itself displays all IP, TCP, 
UDP, and ICMP connection statistics. To just show some basic information. 
For example purposes, only the output from --raw is displayed here. 
Combined with the uptime command, this can be used to get an overview of 
how much traffic your machine is handling on a daily basis.

Note:  For verbosity, the long names for the various flags were given. 
Most can be abbreviated to avoid excessive typing (e.g. netstat -tn, 
netstat -tlp, netstat -r, and netstat -sw). 
 
While netstat is a common utility, hopefully this has demonstrated some 
different ways to make use of the command. For more information see man 8 
netstat.
