Release 2004.1 Information
--------------------------
  
With the release of Gentoo Linux 2004.0 at the end of February, planning 
and work on release 2004.1 have already begun. The goals for this release 
include: 
 
 * Clear and concise guidelines so that the release goes much more 
smoothly and enjoyably. 
 * A better use of infrastructure by revamping the current way releases 
are coordinated to be put on the mirrors. 
 * Catalyst enhancements and bugfixes. 
 * Better communication from releng to the arch release coordinators, and 
vice-a-versa. 
 * Internet-based GRP for Portage's binary download and install 
functionality. 
 * Completion of all items on the 2004.1 Feature Request list. 
 
The 2004.1 Feature Request list[1] includes items like "emerge security" 
functionality, which would integrate GLEPs into Portage so that 
security-related updates can be installed, and a Bootable X GameCD for 
Unreal Tournament 2004.

information on release 2004.1 and other releases, see the Release

This week, we feature Caleb Tennis[3] (caleb), who works on maintaining 
the KDE[4] and related ebuilds, including such things as Qt[5]. His main 
tasks are ensuring that the KDE packages are up to date with the upstream 
versions, testing and debugging for various architectures, and the 
ubiquitous dev task of troubleshooting and clearing bug reports -- a 
daunting task with packages as complex and popular as KDE.

Caleb began using various Unices in the early 1990s, and was introduced to 
Slackware Linux by our very own Corey Shields[6] in 1996. He has been 
using Linux extensively in his job since 2001. Caleb's work includes 
configuring and administrating a large number of custom workstations . 
After struggling with package dependencies and install processes under Red 
Hat, he moved the computers to the source distro Linux From Scratch (LFS). 
This worked better but proved difficult to manage when multiple versions 
of source packages and compile options were being used on various 
computers. After some research, he settled on Gentoo as a solution that 
would allow him to compile from source yet still have good package 
management. He completed the migration of his workplace in early 2003.

Caleb became a Gentoo dev when Dan Armak[7] put out a call for assistance 
on maintaining the KDE ebuilds. As Caleb puts it: "Since I use Gentoo and 
KDE at work, and have a vested interest in it continuing working, I 
volunteered." In addition to his Gentoo work, Caleb was the release 
co-ordinator for the 3.x release of KDevelop[8] as well as a contributor 
of code or documentation to other KDE projects, including the comedi[9] 
control and measurement device interface. Caleb frequently contributes 
patches and bug fixes he encounters in his work and spends significant 
time keeping Gentoo's KDE maintained as well as responding to forum 
queries. He comments that this "is what the community is about".

Caleb works for a small research and development company specializing in 
diesel engine technology. Among his tasks at work was the development of a 
GUI-based data acquisition system that is used for dynamic control and 
testing of engines. He also teaches classes in Linux Systems 
Administration and Solid State Electronics at his local university. He 
holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering, and is working on his Master's at 
Purdue, focusing on Control Systems design. He is an avid mountain biker 
and water skier, and plays piano. His time at such pursuits is somewhat 
limited by a hectic work week, teaching night courses, and his own studies 
(not to mention an apparently patient girlfriend). 
 
Caleb took the opportunity to share some thoughts on Qt and KDE bug 
reports: "Qt and KDE are two of the most compilation resource-intensive 
sets of programs that an end user will install in Gentoo - due to the fact 
that they're written in C++. As such, many users experience build failures 
due to bugs in the C++ compiler or local hardware problems, and not due to 
anything related to KDE itself. The easiest fix, and one that works 90% of 
the time, is to simply use less aggressive compiler optimizations 
(CFLAGS). Remember, Gentoo is all about customization, and gives the end 
user a lot of freedom in how they do things - but in the end, we're all 
still limited by the abilities of the software and the hardware. Sometimes 
the only way to make things work is to not push them to their limits. I 
implore all users who have problems to go to the forums or IRC first, and 
file a bug report only after they don't find a solution." He was frank in 
admitting that "sometimes [he] breaks things", when attempting to keep 
things current on such a complex set of packages, despite testing. But, 
after all, he's both human and a volunteer. He concluded with his favorite 
quotation: "tact is for people who don't understand sarcasm".

udev, Gentoo Style 
 
Gentoo Linux used to be one of the rare Linux distributions to adopt the 
devfs device file system structure across the board. Naturally, since 
devfs has been obsoleted for the 2.6 kernel series, Gentooists are 
experiencing an above average level of confusion when it comes to 
switching to udev. The fact that the latter is still somewhat a work in 
progress leads to interesting results at times... Check the central "udev, 
now what?" thread at the forums, it has been going for three months 
already, but hasn't lost any of its entertainment value: 
 
 * Got udev working, now what?[10]

Gentoo in a distro shootout
 
One gentoo-user list member has decided to pick up the gauntlet and 
support Gentoo in his local LUG "distro shootout". This week, he asked[11] 
the list to help him with topics he can touch on. Help support our 
favorite distro!

Root mounting twice!
 
One reader this week was having some odd problems with his root partition 
-- it was mounting twice! Read up here[12] for a helpful tip on why this 
was happening, and also a quick lesson on /etc/fstab formatting!

6. Tips and Tricks
==================
   
Reading binary data with strings
 
This week's tip shows you how to extract ascii content from binary data 
using strings. This program is useful for determining the contents of 
non-text files such as core or other binary error files. 
 
Use strings filename to print the strings of printable characters in the 
file.
 
For more information, see man strings.
