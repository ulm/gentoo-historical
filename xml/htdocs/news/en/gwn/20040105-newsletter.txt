Gentoo Managers' Meeting Summary - 15 December 2003
---------------------------------------------------
  
A summary[1] and log[2] of the Gentoo Managers' Meeting have now been 
posted on the Gentoo Managers' Meetings[3] page. The main item on the 
agenda that week was the election of a new desktop lead. Unfortunately, 
during the meeting it became clear that the method of electing a new 
manager was far from well-defined, and instead a long discussion about the 
procedure for electing managers took place. One important point was that 
the voice of the developers and the managers would have to be balanced so 
that leaders who would work well with both groups could be in place. This 
discussion was put on hold so that the other items on the agenda could be 
discussed, but in the end it was decided that the issue would have to be 
discussed elsewhere in greater length.

The other point on the agenda was the pending changes to app-portage. Karl 
Kalleberg[4] and Marius Mauch[5] presented the work that was being done on 
the tools-portage herd. Basically, a programmatic interface to the Portage 
database and configuration files is being developed to insulate 
third-party scripts from the internals, and changes being made in Portage 
will have an effect on some existing tools.

GLSA: cvs
---------
  
Quote from http://ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsID=88:
 
"Stable CVS 1.11.11 has been released. Stable releases contain only bug 
fixes from previous versions of CVS. This release adds code to the CVS 
server to prevent it from continuing as root after a user login, as an 
extra failsafe against a compromise of the CVSROOT/passwd file. 
Previously, any user with the ability to write the CVSROOT/passwd file 
could execute arbitrary code as the root user on systems with CVS pserver 
access enabled. We recommend this upgrade for all CVS servers!"
 
 * Severity: High 
 * Packages Affected: <=1.11.10 
 * Rectification: emerge sync emerge -pv '>=dev-util/cvs-1.11.11' emerge 
'>>=dev-util/cvs-1.11.11' emerge clean 
 * GLSA Announcement[6]

Behave...
 
Off the Wall[7] has been one Forum section this newsletter has always 
tried to ignore as much as possible. It's the place people hang out in 
while waiting for emerge to finish (Cerement[8]), and it contains 
everything that can be put into words, ranging from discussions of your 
favourite food morsels via the Ministry of Silly Walks to religious war 
mongering. Although most of it is in good nature, many things appear in 
bad taste. Be that as it may, none of the regulars have managed to 
completely stay away from the Forum's apres-tech lounge. After a 
particularly stormy season inside OTW over the past ten days, the new year 
has started with a refreshing reminder from Forum admin klieber[9] that it 
is not the place to be squeamish in, but will stay within the bounds of 
civilised speech or else. What exactly that means? You'll find out when 
one of the ever-vigilant moderators spots a flaw in your interpretation of 
"professional" and "courteous":

To GUI or not to GUI 
 
The Gentoo install[11] process is admired (by some) and leaves some things 
to be desired (for some). So ensues the great GUI or Non-GUI Installer 
debate in this week's[12] gentoo-user highlight.

Telnet
 
A wonderful little discussion took place in the -dev mailing rooms this 
week about the benefets and risks of using telnet, especially when related 
to users, and the typical questions they have about it. Also, there were 
some ideas about giving advice to users through ebuilds, especially when 
related to security. Have a look here[13] and here[14] for the posts.

Italy: GECHI Domain Now Up And Running
 
GECHI (GEntoo CHannel Italia)[15] proudly announced on 1 January that the 
new year starts with a domain name of their own, and a working website to 
back it up. If you are Italian, living/working in Italy or the Italian 
speaking part of Switzerland, or just generally interested in Things 
Italian, read the manifesto[16] and see what you can do to contribute to 
the promotion of Gentoo Linux.

Germany: Photo Gallery of Hamburg GLUG Meeting, Next Meeting Scheduled
 
Interestingly enough, most participants of the first Hamburg Gentoo Linux 
User Group Meeting last December seem to be glad that their photos[17] are 
beyond recognition. Whatever their motives are to keep a low profile, they 
are going to show in public again: A tentative meeting date has been set 
for 25 January, to be held at the same location as last time, the 
Schachcaf√©[18]. Coordination thread in the Forums as usual, i.e. here[19].

Spain: gentoo-es.org now open
 
Gentoo-Es[20], a Spanish Gentoo community site, is now open. Complete with 
various articles and blogs, forums, and Spanish language documentation, 
this site should be a great resource for Spanish-speaking Gentoo users.

6. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Shell Auto-logout
 
This week's tip shows you how to have your shell automatically logout 
after a set period of time. 
 
Use the TMOUT variable in your shell to control how long your shell will 
remain logged in with no activity. For example, to have your shell 
automatically logged out after 1 hour of no activity, add TMOUT=3600 to 
your shell initialization file (e.g. .bashrc or .zshrc). This setting 
could also be added system wide in /etc/profile as a default setting for 
all users.
