<title>Common Portage error message</title>
<body>
<p>
For those users who encounter a Portage error similar to the following:
"<path>!!! Cannot resolve a virtual package name to an ebuild.</path>" 
during an '<c>emerge --sync</c>' or an '<c>emerge --metadata</c>' please 
do <b>not</b> file a bug about it.  The code may instruct you to do 
so, however the developers have already found a fix and it is already on 
bugzilla, re-emerging Portage or metadata will suffice. Bug reports filed for this bug 
will only be marked as duplicates of <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114798">bug 114798</uri>.  Please see that bug report as well as the Portage project's <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/doc/common-problems.xml">documentation 
page</uri> for details and a fix for this issue. Thanks in advance from the 
Portage Team.

<title>PPC project meeting 5 March 2005</title>
<body>
<p>
The PPC project held a meeting on Sunday, 5 March 2005. The turnout for was fairly 
impressive. It was composed of a large majority of the PPC team members. The items on the 
agenda included gcc 4.1, the 2006.0 release, leadership, Genesi/Freescale/IBM 
developer programs, and installer project porting. The meeting lasted about one and 
a half hours, and included some notes by <mail link="halcyon@gentoo.org">Mark Loeser</mail> 
for gcc 4.1, and <mail link="agaffney@gentoo.org">Andrew Gaffney</mail> for the installer 
project. Minutes for the meeting and a full log can be found at the <uri

<body>
<p>
Gentoo's central address for release images, <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml">the bouncer system</uri>, keeps 
track of the number of downloads. Since the 2006.0 release was available on the 
mirrors, almost 100,000 images have been downloaded to date.
</p>

<p>
Similar statistics exist for the Bittorrent fileshares that are monitored via 
the Gentoo tracker. During the same one week period since the 
release of 2006.0, about 5000 LiveCD downloads were completed via the tracker.

<p><b>enable UTF8 per default?</b></p>
<p>
After last week's FOSDEM meeting a few ideas were being discussed -
among them enabling UTF-8 in the default profiles. PPC has
been doing it for some time, and it would be helpful to the non-English
users. So what has kept unicode from being enabled by default? There 
are few known bugs with unicode, so hopefully it will be enabled
per default in the near future.
</p>

UTF8 per default? </uri></li>
</ul>


<p><b>2006.0 - me having a bad day?</b></p>
<p>
With the new release come new bugs - and this user seems to have hit all
roadbumps that he could find while trying to download 2006.0. Some very
nice criticism that shows how end-users often get a totally different
view on your product - in this case the download pages - and infra
member Jeffrey Forman jumps into the discussion and tries to fix all
issues reported.

<p><b>QA Team discussion</b></p>
<p>
The Quality Assurance Team is growing stronger and more active. Until recently its authority 
wasn't well-defined, and it could only try to convince people to fix issues, but now <mail 
link="halcy0n@gentoo.org">Mark Loeser</mail> in his role as QA lead starts 
one of the longest threads of the last weeks by offering a policy for the 
QA team and asking the council to vote on this policy in the next meeting, thus 
enabling the QA team to officially fix bugs and override developers in the rare 
cases this may be needed. The proposal as such has already been modified, the 
discussion is still going on. During one of the next Council Meetings this should be
decided.

<title>USA: Gentoo seminar at Embedded Systems Conference</title>
<body>
<p>
Sergei Larin, Senior Applications Engineer at <uri 
link="http://www.freescale.com">Freescale Semiconductor</uri> will give his 
first <uri link="https://www.cmpevents.com/ESCw06/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=11&amp;SessID=1102">class 
on Gentoo</uri> on 4 April at the Embedded Systems Conference in San Jose (3 to 
7 April at the McEnery Convention Center). His joint presentation with Gentoo 
developer <mail link="pvdabeel@gentoo.org">Pieter Van den Abeele</mail> explores 
the possibilities of reducing the time to market for PowerPC-based devices using 
open-source software. Freescale decided to go with Gentoo as the foundation for 
that approach because of its configurability and the ease of applications in the 
embedded market. The scope of this Linux design seminar will be how to build a 
"Home Media Center with Linux on the PowerPC archiecture." Freescale is planning 
to give similar classes at LinuxWorld in Boston and other events in the future.

<title>Germany: Call for papers for FrOSCon</title>
<body>
<p>
FrOSCon is a two-day conference on free software and open source, which
takes place on 24th and 25th June 2006 at the University of Applied
Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, in St. Augustin near Bonn, Germany. One of its 
organizers is Gentoo developer <mail link="sebastian@gentoo.org">Sebastian 
Bergmann</mail>. The focus of the conference is a comprehensive range of 
talks about current topics in free software and open source. Furthermore, 
space will be provided for developers of free software and open-source 
projects to organize their own developer meetings or even their own program. 
FrOSCon is organized for the first time in 2006 by the department of
computer science in collaboration with the Linux/Unix User Group Sankt
Augustin, the student body and the FrOSCon e.V., and aims to establish
itself as the largest event of its kind in Rhineland. The <uri link="http://www.froscon.org/wiki/CallforPapers">call for papers</uri>
is still open until 15 March, and developer rooms and booth space are 
also available to interested projects.

<uri link="http://sagetv.com/">SageTV</uri> has released a "Linux OEM edition" 
of their media center -- based on Gentoo Linux: "The installation medium is a 
customised Gentoo install CD, you can modify it for the needs of your company 
if you plan to build many identical systems," says the <uri link="http://sagetv.com/linuxOEMinstall.html">SageTV website</uri>. They
are looking for hardware manufacturers who would be interested in including

<title>Heise (2 March 2006, in German)</title>
<body>
<p>
This week Germany's most important computer magazine carried a sneak preview on 
<uri link="http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/70300">an article</uri> that will be 
officially published in the "<uri link="http://www.opensourcejahrbuch.de">Open-source 
yearbook</uri>" that will be published later this month. Bill Hilf, Platform 
Technology Strategy Director at Microsoft and responsible for the Linux and 
open-source lab there, gives some interesting insights to what the "open-source 
bubble in a Microsoft sea" does, how it's equipped etc. The article isn't entirely
up-to-date (it still mentions Daniel Robbins as a prominent member of the team), 
but it identifies Gentoo and Portage as fields of research and explains what Microsoft's 
"shared source" project is about.
