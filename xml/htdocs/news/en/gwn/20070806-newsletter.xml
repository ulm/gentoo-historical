<title>Baselayout-2 Plans for Stabilization</title>
<body>

<p>
baselayout-2.0.0_rc1 has been placed in the tree without any keywords and in 
package.mask ARCH teams will keyword rc1 to indicate they are ready for it to 
move to ~ARCH. When all keywords have been re-applied, the team will then 
remove it from package.mask. Now is a very good time to test the new baselayout
version and report any last minute bugs!
</p>

<p>
UPGRADE NOTES:
</p>

<ul>
<li>splashutils users will have to re-emerge splashutils for it to work 
correctly.</li>
<li>net.eth0 may disappear as we only ship net.lo (net.lo0 for *BSD) now as 
there is no guarantee that eth0 exists on the host system. As such you may have
to re-link net.eth0 to net.lo like so ln -s net.lo /etc/init.d/net.eth0. One 
idea is to get udev to automatically make the link for you - see bug 
#186156.</li>
<li>If you see any errors like `einfo: no such command` or similar then please 
file a bug against the package in question and get them to use 
/etc/init.d/functions.sh and not sbin/functions.sh.</li>
<li>WARNING: The volume initialization code (such as device-mapper) has been 
removed from baselayout and placed into init scripts. These new scripts will 
need to be manually added to the boot runlevel. If you don't do this your 
system may not boot!</li>

<title>"Excuse me, are YOU the tooth fairy?" -Christian Heim, aka phreak</title>

<body>
<figure link="/images/gwn/20070806_phreak.jpg"
  short="phreak" caption="Christian Heim, aka phreak"/>

<p>
This week's developer of the week is 24 year old Christian Heim, known as 
phreak. He lives in Negast, near Stralsund, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.  Christian lives with his parents and younger brother along with their three 
cats.
</p>

<p>
Christian started an apprenticeship with the local university in 2002 and has 
worked at the University of Greifswald as an IT Specialist since then. His 
typical day involves, as he puts it, the usual mayhem ... looking at some 
provisioning, breaking some central windows/SLES boxes, and messing around with
his trainees.
</p>

<p>
When Christian isnt at work or working on Gentoo, he's off enjoying a variety of
other interests. He especially enjoys driving his new Renault Megane. He loves 
to watch movies and has a collection of over 500 DVDs. His favorite movie is 
SWAT though Transformers is a close runner up. Christian loves to listen to 
music, especially while he's working on Gentoo. Some of his favorites are Korn,
Limp Bizkit, Rammstein, and Tiesto. He admits to not vacationing much in recent
years, but said that he would love to go on a Sahara transition (trekking around
the desert) or even just a couple of weeks on an island in the South Pacific. 
When asked what his most unusual hobby was, without hesitation he responded 
"Nordic walking."
</p>

<p>
As with many developers, Christian was looking for something more customizable 
than the other Linux flavors and basically stumbled upon Gentoo. He said that 
what he likes best about using Gentoo is that it is so easy to "write" new 
"packages" (ebuilds) and that it makes him happy every time he has to write 
something new up. Christian was looking at linux-vserver and 
<mail link="hollow@gentoo.org">Benedikt Boehm</mail> encouraged him to join and 
help with maintaining ebuilds. In August of 2005, phreak was unleashed as a 
Gentoo developer. Christian currently contributes to a variety of Gentoo 
projects. He works with Release Engineering as the Gentoo Hardened Liaison, on 
the Virtual Private Server team, the Apache team, the Hardened team, the Kernel 
team, and on the Developer Relations team.
</p>

<p>
Christian's home computers consist of an Athlon-XP 3000 workstation and his 
Pentium-M notebook, both of which are running Gentoo hardened. When he settles 
down for some serious computing, his first applications to launch are kmail, 
konsole, and amarok.

<title>Gentoo Linux - Die Metadistribution</title>
<body>

<p>
"<uri link="http://www.mitp.de/1769">Gentoo Linux - Die
Metadistribution</uri>" is the first book on Gentoo Linux published in the
German language.
</p>

<p>
This book helps getting started with the Gentoo Distribution and
escorts from an installation at the beginning, following by an introduction
on Gentoos package-manager to installation and configuration of a Gentoo
Desktop-System. It's mainly focussed on configuration and work with Gentoos
package-manager "Portage" though. Gentoo Developer and author Tobias
Scherbaum: "At several events where we represented Gentoo lots visitors
asked about a book on Gentoo. But especially the existing documentation
which is excellent made it quite hard writing that book. Therefore it is
not surprising that the first considerations about this book goes back
until 2004". More information about that book can be found on the <uri
link="http://www.mitp.de/1769">Publisher's website</uri>.
</p>

<p>
"Gentoo Linux - Die Metadistribution" covers about 270 pages and is
published by MITP. It is available in bookstores at the price of 29,95
EURO. The price includes a donation the 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo-ev.org">FÃ¶rderverein Gentoo e.V. / Friends of
Gentoo e.V.</uri>.

<p>
This section lists packages that have either been moved or added to the tree
and packages that have had their "last rites" announcement given to be removed
in the future. The package removals come from many locations, including the <uri
link="/proj/en/qa/treecleaners">Treecleaners</uri> and various developers. Most
packages which are listed under the Last Rites section are in need of some love
and care and can remain in the tree if proper maintainership is established.
