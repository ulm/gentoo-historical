Gentoo Linux at Linux World Expo on August 5-7
----------------------------------------------
  
Gentoo Linux will be at Linux World Expo[1] in San Francisco at the 
Moscone Convention Center on August 5-7, where we'll be releasing Gentoo 
Linux 1.4. Find us at booth #1 in the .org pavillion where we'll be giving 
away free Gentoo Linux 1.4 LiveCDs and free computer hardware, including a 
new Pentium 4 system and an Epson Stylus Photo 900 printer. We have many 
other surprises planed both on site and online, so please join us at the 
show!

First Gentoo BugDay held on August 2
------------------------------------
  
The first Gentoo BugDay was a success: 130 participants gathered in 
#gentoo-bugs on irc.freenode.net, and a total of 124 bugs were closed - 
about double the usual number (51 bugs were closed last Saturday). Users 
and developers worked together in the channel, testing, discussing, and 
fixing bugs. It was a great chance for users and developers to get to know 
each other, and we may even have scouted a few candidates for future 
developers. The current plan is to hold BugDays on the first Saturday of 
each month; thanks to Brian Jackson[2] for organizing this event.

WineX ebuilds removed from Portage
----------------------------------
  
By request from Transgaming Technologies, two WineX ebuilds (winex and 
winex-cvs) which build WineX from Transgaming's public CVS tree available 
under the Aladdin Free Public License have been removed from Portage and 
will no longer be maintained. According to Transgaming, the public CVS 
tree's purpose is not to provide a free version of WineX, but to enable 
people to assist with their development efforts, and if it's trivial for 
people to get WineX from CVS without contributing, it seriously 
discourages them from providing public CVS at all. See this excerpt from 
their LICENSE[3]: 

 3. 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/winex/wine/LICENS
E?rev=1.9
 
"Note that while this license does permit certain kinds of non-commercial 
distribution of pre-compiled binary packages of WineX, doing so on a large 
scale is discouraged, as it affects TransGaming's ability to continue to 
improve and develop the code. TransGaming reserves the right to change the 
license under which TransGaming-owned copyright code is made available, 
and will not hesitate to do so if non-commercial distribution of 
pre-compiled binary packages adversely affects the financing of continued 
development."  
 
The winex-transgaming ebuild remains available for subscribers to 
Transgaming who want to install binary WineX packages. Also, Wine, the 
free project on which WineX is based, is still in the Portage tree.

=================================
  
Seemant Kulleen
 
Figure 4.1: Seemant Kulleen
http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20030804_seemant.jpg
 
This week, we're pleased to feature Seemant Kulleen[5] (seemant), a 
long-time developer and familiar name from the forums and mailing lists. 
Gentoo is actually Seemant's first involvement with a major Open Source 
project, where he served until recently as Project Co-Ordinator. He is on 
Gentoo's XFree team and often contributes bugfixes to unmaintained 
packages (before embarking on a mission to find a maintainer).

 5. seemant@gentoo.org
 
A few weeks ago, Seemant was named to a position as the Manager of 
Developer Relations under Gentoo's new management structure[6]. Developer 
Relations' primary responsibility will be the care and feeding of Gentoo's 
burgeoning developer community. This includes identifying and recruiting 
new developers, providing resources for the developers, organizing teams, 
and resolving conflicts. He is currently working with Jon Portnoy[7] on 
creating a Developer's Handbook that will formalize some of the technical 
details of the development process and assist with training new 
developers. He is also working on the Developer Relations Ombudsman 
subproject suggested by Grant Goodyear[8] as an effort to provide a stable 
and neutral avenue for conflict resolution. More information about the 
Developer Relations project can be found at its project page[9]. Seemant 
also assists with Quality Assurance and Public Relations for the 
management team.

Seemant is a Master's candidate at the Rochester Institute of Technology, 
currently working on his thesis. He lives in Santa Monica, CA where he 
spends much of his time working on Gentoo. He runs a black nForce2 box 
with an Athlon-XP 2100 and a Sun Ultra 1 currently serving as a firewall. 
He generally has sylpheed-claws and xchat1 running with XFce4 as the 
Window Manager. He is also fond of rsync, screen and gkrellm. He usually 
has a coke to hand. He describes Gentoo as "a dream" and is particularly 
proud of the Gentoo developer community, which he describes as "nothing 
short of magicians". He made a point of thanking the Gentoo Developers and 
user base for making it possible to work on such an "awesome distro".

Decking Out Your Desktop
 
Want to know what people are doing with their customized desktops? The 
original Gentoo Desktops thread, begun over a year ago, has been locked, 
but in its place we now have Gentoo Desktops Part 2, which has already 
received 450 replies. If you're particularly proud of your desktop and 
want to post a screenshot or want to look at others' setups for 
inspiration, then look no further.

Artwiz fonts coming soon to Gnome2 and KDE3
 
Forum user aLEczapKA[12] had been hard at work trying to get the Artwiz 
fonts working under GTK2 and Qt3, when he realized that Alexander Kahl[13] 
had posted[14] an improved ebuild on Bugzilla mere days ago. In either 
case, though, it seems Gentoo will be one of the first distributions to 
have Xft/Freetype-compatible Artwiz fonts.

Clarifying the meaning of x86 and ~x86 
 
Determined to fully understand the difference between ~x86 and x86 
keywords, Gentoo User Jonathan Kelly shot an email out to fellow Gentoo 
Users. They were quick to point out that ~x86 isn't really considered to 
be "unstable" but rather a "testing" area. Once a package's build process 
as well as it's overall execution is tested and considered stable, it is 
released to the masses for consumption under the x86 keyword. Additionally 
users pointed out that ppc, ~ppc, as well as other architectural keywords 
exist to suit the same purpose of testing and stable packages. Read it 
here[16]

A new Itanium box!
 
Kurt Lieber  posted[17] the fantastic news that the Gentoo Linux project 
now has access to an Itanium box! This is especially great for any 
developers who wish to test with this in mind.

Downloading binaries.
 
Whilst this idea might seem a bit out of place in the Gentoo Linux 
community, Fredrik Danerklint  brought up[18] a question about the emerge 
flag "--usepkg" - used for downloading binaries as opposed to source - to 
be implemented in our much loved make.conf.

Gentoo Linux will be at the Chaos Communication Camp 2003[19]. This second 
International Open Air Hacker Gathering will take place on a field nearby 
Berlin from 7th to 10th August, organized by the German hacker-group Chaos 
Computer Club. There will be a lot of lectures in English, the world's 
largest civil open-air network, and, of course, fun. A Gentoo tent will be 
set up where you'll be able to meet developers, ask them questions about 
Gentoo, grab the recent LiveCDs, and exchange your experiences with 
Gentoo.

9. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
A Quick and Easy Password Generator
 
This week's tip shows you how to quickly generate a list of passwords 
using /dev/urandom, and uuencode. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.1:                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|% dd if=/dev/urandom count=1 2> /dev/null | uuencode -m - | head -n 2 |\ |
|tail -n 1 | cut -c-8                                                     |
|v1/oVN+S                                                                 |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The options for the cut command indicate the length of the password 
generated (in this case, 8 characters). This could easily be expanded to 
generate a whole list of passwords using the for command. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.2:                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|% for ((n=0;n<10;n++)); do dd if=/dev/urandom count=1 2> /dev/null |\    |
|uuencode -m -| head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | cut -c-8; done                    |
|rSQpeNNr                                                                 |
|PesAIgAb                                                                 |
|GUEgoUwT                                                                 |
|U3p+kfqa                                                                 |
|WSgSwgq6                                                                 |
|+9aGihvl                                                                 |
|dYfcaV3b                                                                 |
|guFtI7eZ                                                                 |
|+kzKuW0f                                                                 |
|jJpW/8yO                                                                 |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
To create a longer or shorter list, just change the limit in for (in this 
case 10). 
 
If you want to generate WEP keys for wireless networking, you can use a 
similar procedure, replacing uuencode with md5sum: 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 9.3:                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|% dd if=/dev/urandom count=1 2> /dev/null | md5sum | head -n 2 | tail -n\|
|1 | cut -c-26                                                            |
|aaab69457c239ef1d52617d1fa                                               |
