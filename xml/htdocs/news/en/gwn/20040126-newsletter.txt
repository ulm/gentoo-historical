SELinux i686 LiveCD now available
---------------------------------
  
Much progress has been made recently in integrating SELinux[1] into Gentoo 
Linux, and now we're proud to announce that an experimental SELinux i686 
LiveCD[2] is available, along with fresh stages[3] 1 through 3. The 
install guide[4] is also experimental, but now users should be able to 
install SELinux from scratch. Tread with care, and make sure to report 
bugs[5]. The only current known issue has to do with denials from DHCP 
when booting from the LiveCD.

/sbin/init the initial policy load), read Chris PeBenito[6]'s message to

This week, we are featuring Sergey Kuleshov[7] (svyatogor), the lead for 
the Gentoo Documentation Project's[8] Internationalization Subproject[9], 
and one of the Russian translators. His main responsibilities include 
co-ordinating and training new translators and translation teams, ensuring 
translation accuracy is checked and (of course) doing some of the 
translations to Russian. He is also responsible for ensuring that 
translation teams continue to update documentation as it evolves.

Sergey is a university student, currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics 
Computing and Statistics via correspondence with London University[10]. He 
lives on Cyprus and enjoys reading Science Fiction. He is also learning to 
play guitar. He normally uses a P4 workstation (2.6 GHz, 1024 MB, 80 GB) 
as well as a 600 MHz Celeron Notebook. He is a fluxbox[11] user who 
prefers mlterm[12] for console chores and gvim[13] for editing. He 
communicates using Mozilla Firebird[14] and Thunderbird[15], as well as 
PSI Jabber[16] and XChat[17].

Sergey has been using Linux for the last four years, progressing from 
Corel Linux through several iterations of Red Hat and Mandrake before 
discovering Gentoo in 2001. His experience with Gentoo began with a few 
articles by George Shapovalov[18] and Aleksey Fedorchuk on 
linuxshop.ru[19], and moved to the new distro when he finally got his 
PCMCIA NIC working with the LiveCD. He explained that his preference for 
Gentoo comes out of the fact that it is an "OS where you really know what 
is going on." He joined the Gentoo developer team after reading in GWN 
that George Shapovalov was heading up Russian translation efforts. Sergey 
volunteered his services, and was brought into the project. Sergey has 
also started up his own OSS project, the GNSS Neural Network 
Simulator"[20], which "is a tool for creating and teaching various types 
of neural networks."

3. Gentoo Security
==================
  
GLSA: honeyd
------------
  
Honeyd is a virtual honeypot daemon that can simulate virtual hosts on 
unallocated IP addresses. Identification of Honeyd installations allows an 
adversary to launch attacks specifically against Honeyd. No remote root 
exploit is currently known. A bug in handling NMAP fingerprints caused 
Honeyd to reply to TCP packets with both the SYN and RST flags set. 
Watching for replies, it is possible to detect IP addresses simulated by 
Honeyd. Although there are no public exploits known for Honeyd, the 
detection of Honeyd IP addresses may in some cases be undesirable.
 
Honeyd 0.8 has been released along with an advisory[21] to address this 
issue. In addition, Honeyd 0.8 drops privileges if permitted by the 
configuration file and contains command line flags to force dropping of 
privileges.

 * Packages Affected: <honeyd-0.8

Backup Techniques 
 
Backups are critical if your computer has data of any worth on it. 
Gentoo-user had a great thread[23] on different backup methods.

7. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Using watch to repeat comands
 
This week's tip shows you how to use watch to have commands run 
repeatedly. Make sure you have the sys-apps/procps package installed to 
make use of watch. 
 
Whenever you have a long-running process (such as removing a complex 
directory tree or creating a large backup with tar), it is common to 
periodically check the progress of the task using ls, ps, grep, or a 
combination of these and other utilities. Instead of repeatedly executing 
these commands, you can have watch do it for you. For the most basic 
usage, just append your command to watch and run it. The screen will 
update every few seconds (2 by default), and rerun the command for you. 
 
For example, if you're copying an ISO image that's about 650MB and you 
want to see if it's done, you could use a command similar to this one:
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 7.1:                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|% watch ls -lh filename.iso                                              |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
When the size stops increasing and it's around 650MB, you know the file 
copy operation has finished.
 
For more information on using watch, see man 1 watch.
