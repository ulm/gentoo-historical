Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc4 Released
-----------------------------
  
Earlier this week, the decision was made to release the next version of 
Gentoo Linux 1.4 as Release Candidate 4, rather than Final. Improvements 
to the rc4 release include much better hardware detection on the LiveCD 
installation disc as well as major updates to various packages in the 
Portage tree. The decision to issue another release candidate was made due 
to a number of reasons, including: 
 
 
 * Binary packages required for the Gentoo Reference Platform have yet to 
   be built or tested. Until these are completed, 1.4_final cannot be 
   released. 
 * The version of baselayout currently marked as "stable" still depends on 
   tmpfs. One of the goals of 1.4 from the beginning was to eliminate 
   baselayout's dependency on tmpfs. There is a masked version of baselayout 
   in Portage that solves this issue, but it has not received adequate 
   testing as of yet. (Anyone using or willing to test this version of 
   baselayout is encouraged to report their results on Gentoo Stable[1]) 
 * Automated Kernel Building is currently undergoing testing for inclusion 
   in 1.4_final

New Unreal Tournament 2003 Game CD
----------------------------------
  
A new Unreal Tournament 2003 Game CD has been released and can be 
downloaded here[2] as well as any of our other mirrors[3]. This CD allows 
you to run the Unreal Tournament 2003 demo directly from CD, with no 
installation required. Just boot your computer from the CD and play! The 
latest CD includes a highly-optimized gaming kernel, which significantly 
improves overall gameplay. Other improvements include the latest NVIDIA 
drivers (1.0.4349) with GeForce FX support, preliminary bootsplash 
support, full autodetection of all hardware and countless other 
enhancements. This GameCD does require a modern NVIDIA graphics card to 
run the ut2003-demo.

You can also run the latest demo on your existing Gentoo Linux system 
provided you have a modern NVIDIA graphics card. Just type emerge 
ut2003-demo and then type ut2003-demo to start the game. The use of the 
gaming-sources kernel is recommended for optimum gaming performance and 
responsiveness.

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
Bob Johnson
 
The Gentoo LiveCD is the tool that got Gentoo Linux onto most people's 
systems and is often the first impression of Gentoo that users get. This 
week's featured developer, Bob Johnson[14], is in charge of the livecd-ng 
scripts that are used to make the LiveCDs (curious readers can go ahead 
and emerge it since it's in Portage), and has been building the last few 
x86 LiveCDs. His work with the LiveCDs mostly involves listening to users 
complain about how they can't get the LiveCD to boot or get their NIC 
working, and then working to fix the problem. Bob's involvement with the 
Gentoo team began when he was suddenly asked to get the xfs-sources kernel 
ready for the 1.4-rc2 LiveCD in 24 hours when he had only been running 
Gentoo for about two weeks. In addition to working on livecd-ng and the 
x86 CDs, Bob also maintains xfs-sources and gs-sources (to find out about 
these and other kernels, read KC6:Which Sources?[15] in the forums.) 

 14. livewire@gentoo.org
 15. http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=24634
 
Bob's main box is an Athlon XP 2100+ with 512MB RAM, seven hard drives 
(four SCSI, three IDE), dual NVIDIA cards with a 19-inch monitor attached 
to each and running KDE, which Bob used to think was ugly but now, at 
version 3.1, loves. He uses VMWare a lot for testing, and doesn't know 
what he'd do without it. 
 
Bob owns a concrete and excavating company, and has been in the business 
for seventeen years. He's been married for fifteen years, has a 
thirteen-year-old-daughter, and has two beagles in his home in 
Indianapolis, Indiana. During the summer he spends a lot of time at the 
lake, slalom water skiing, and waxing the 20-foot Caravelle he bought last 
year when he isn't boating.

Happy Birthday, Gentoo Forums!
 
The first post to the freshly installed Gentoo Forums was an announcement 
by Forum founder Nitro on 9 April 2002: "This forum is my shot at helping 
users of Gentoo (including myself)." What started as a humble affair on a 
cable connection has quickly developed into one of the most successful and 
exciting tech support venues on the web, with an average of 700 new posts 
every day, five-digit user head count and a peculiar atmosphere that sets 
it apart from most other Linux forums. People here are polite, eloquent, 
uncommonly helpful to others and generally the best of folks. 
Congratulations to us all:

Getting the most USE out of it...
 
The USE flag system portage implements may well pose as a source of 
anxiety for the Gentoo newbie. Carlos Gonzalez began a thread exemplifying 
the somewhat complicated process of having to modify USE flags on a per 
package basis (stripping JAVA for a PHP emerge). Thankfully the thread[23] 
mentioned a tool created to simplify the process of managing these USE 
flags, ufed -- Use Flag Editor, where flags are explained and can be 
toggled on and off. Carl Hudkins noted his *wish*[24] that ufed would be 
included on Gentoo's LiveCD.

p2p for the masses
 
It's finally happened, p2p has gone mainstream and the sheer amount of 
KaZa'ers are rivaling the once dominant Napster network. While some Gentoo 
users have jumped on the bandwagon by installing Kazaa lite using wine (a 
MS Windows emulator), Chris Graves wants to get down with p2p clients 
native to Linux. The good news is that Linux is far from lacking in p2p 
clients, and that the network was in fact pioneered with open source 
clients developed for Linux. Keppy mentions Gentoo's commitment to these 
programs in the form of the portage directory: /usr/portage/net-p2p/. 
Limewire[26] a popular open source p2p client written in Java was also 
recommended, though not in portage.

Performance in Gentoo
 
The Linux kernel project has given rise to quite a few derivatives over 
the years. And while the Kernel project tries to maintain a stable kernel 
befitting a general public. The spawned derivatives implement a wide 
variety of changes often brought by many different people. This plethora 
of minds and opinions going into the kernel is its strength. Then 
naturally it becomes hard to choose.
 
One way to reduce the dilemma of choosing is simply trying out the 
different major distributions. This way we can see how the specific 
distribution performs the task it is set to do.
 
While performing a little speed test, this user[28] noticed that 
apparantly the Gentoo kernel had a relative performance low compared to 
the Red Hat installed kernel.

 28. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-dev&m=104989389322277&w=2
 
The discussion itself evolves around a specific system call monitored with 
a specific lmbench[29]. But for those of you eeking to test your linux box 
here are a couple of resources you might want to take a look at.

 29. http://www.bitmover.com/lmbench/
 
First of all, don't forget that the kernel is not the distribution. Never 
compare the incomparable. Remember, similar configurations, similar 
platforms, similar patches and so on. Now, having a good test foundation 
we need a tool - which Gentoo provides here[30]. And there is a 
benchmarking howto available at TLDP[31]

 30. http://www.gentoo.org/dyn/pkgs/app-benchmarks/index.xml
 31. http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Benchmarking-HOWTO.html
 
Now, as annoying as this can be, the trick is knowing what flag goes with 
what package. And also remember that there are default flags set.
 
The way around the first dilemma is to run the command "emerge -pv 
[package_name]" this will show what flags go with what package package
 
And the default flags are not apparant either. However the command "grep 
-A 3 USE /etc/make.profile/make.defaults" will reveal the secret. But 
caution, do not change the make.defaults. Rather modify your make.conf and 
you can even build your own USE string from scratch. To compose your own 
list of USE flags you set USE="-* [your flag list]". Where "-*" unsets all 
flags and "[your flag list]" simply is the string of flags you choose to 
enable.
 
Gentoo as a binary release?
 
The question was raised as to why Gentoo does not provide a binary package 
system[32]. Binary vs. source has always been a point of contention among 
Gentoo users. Many want the convenience and speed offered by binary 
packages while others decry such efforts as taking focus away from making 
Gentoo Linux the best source-based distribution available.

 32. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-dev&m=104995516118042&w=2
 
As some users may already know, Gentoo Linux is working on providing a 
limited subset of binary packages in the form of the Gentoo Reference 
Platform. Applications such as KDE, XFree86 and other large applications 
will be offered in both source and binary form in order to provide a 
choice to our users. The first "official" release of the Gentoo Reference 
Platform will come with the final release of Gentoo Linux 1.4.

Taiwanese Gentoo Initiatives Merging
 
In a big push for the fledgling Chinese Gentoo user communities, Gentoo 
Taiwan GOT, gentoo.org.tw)[33] was set up last week. Patrick Hsieh, 
the coordinator, and a few zealous Gentooists are merging their strength 
to establish a local Gentoo organization in Taiwan. They're not only 
promoting Gentoo to the Taiwanese Linux user sphere, but also making every 
effort to help localizing Gentoo Linux for the realm of the Big5 Chinese 
encoding. "We already have a dedicated rsync server (rsync.gentoo.org.tw) 
and an ambitious new forum (http://openbazaar.net)[34] plus an almost 
ready gentoo FTP server(ftp.gentoo.org.tw). And definitely more and more 
users will see how we make the difference," says Patrick Hsieh. The GOT 
web portal is also under construction and about to be unveiled in a few 
days.

Meanwhile Back in Reality: Italian Consultancy Deploys Gentoo Linux
 
Verona, a rather attractive spot in Northern Italy, is better known for 
its historic arena dating from the Roman empire (and notorious for 
butchering opera master pieces at that same location). A lesser known fact 
is that it's currently spearheading Gentoo's move to professional 
corporate use: Euronia[36], a technology consultancy firm in Verona, made 
the switch from SuSE to Gentoo Linux for their own computers as early as 
release 1.0, and started offering services based on Gentoo six months ago. 
Their customers include Banca Populare di Verona e Ravenna, the largest 
banking group in the region, where Euronia set up a proxy for 7500 users, 
a reverse SSL proxy, secure FTP and other servers, all powered by Gentoo 
Linux. At Antex (a major HR consultancy in Italy), the tax calculations 
for 150,000 pay checks each month are done on a Gentoo-based SQL server, 
and a handful of other banks had Euronia switch their web servers to 
Gentoo as their operating system, too. Euronia's push for Gentoo Linux in 
corporate server solutions is easily explained: "We find that Gentoo Linux 
is the most advanced distro available", says Andrea Gagliardi, head of 
technology at Euronia. "We build solutions for customers, like the servers 
we usually base on EVMS-enabled Vanilla kernels with a dozen other stable 
patches thrown in, or our embedded Xfree on Aquapads (diskless tablet 
PCs). Nothing we've tried makes setting up and deploying all those 
customizations more manageable than Gentoo".

Using /dev/loop to view a CD image
 
This week's tip explains how to use the loop device to view or share files 
from a CD image or ISO file. 
 
First, you need to make sure you have support in your kernel. It can be 
configured as a module so there's no need to reboot if you don't have 
support.

To view the contents of an iso file, just mount the iso on a loopback 
device. For example, here we mount gentoo-basic-x86-1.4_rc4.iso to 
gentoo-1.4_rc4/. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Mounting an iso on a loopback                                           |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# mount gentoo-basic-x86-1.4_rc4.iso gentoo-1.4_rc4 -o \                 |
|  loop=/dev/loop1,blocksize=1024                                         |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now you can view the directory gentoo-1.4_rc4 just as if it were part of 
your regular filesystem.
