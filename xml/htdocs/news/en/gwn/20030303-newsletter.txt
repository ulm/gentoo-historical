Gentoo Linux at the Game Developers Conference
----------------------------------------------
  
The 2003 Game Developers Conference[1] kicks off on Tuesday, March 4th. The GDC
is one of the world's premier conferences dedicated to the computer gaming
industry with several conference tracks focused on today's hot gaming topics.
One of the highlights of the conference is the GDC Expo where vendors and
exhibitors show off the latest and greatest software and hardware. This year,
Gentoo Linux will be present at the NVIDIA booth, along with Emmett Plant, CEO
of Vorbis[2]. Demonstrations of Unreal Tournament 2003 will be on display to
show the power of Gentoo Linux and NVIDIA hardware.

So, if you're going to be at the GDC, be sure and stop by the NVIDIA booth 
to show your support for Gentoo Linux. You'll get a chance to meet Daniel 
Robbins, Seemant Kulleen and some of the other Gentoo Developers. 
Attendees may also get a chance to talk to Emmett Plant about the future 
of Ogg Vorbis, upcoming Ogg-capable portables or any number of other 
Ogg-related developments. 
    
Open Developer Positions in the Gentoo Linux Project
----------------------------------------------------
  
Currently, the Gentoo Linux project has a number of open developer 
positions available for people who are interested in becoming more 
involved with the Gentoo Linux project. These positions include: 
 
 * Technical Writer -- Help the documentation team maintain the high 
   quality of the Gentoo Linux documentation. We're looking for folks with an 
   aptitude for technical writing, along with an expert command of the 
   english language. 
 * Kernel Developer -- Help make gentoo-sources as feature-rich and robust 
   as possible. Bring your kernel hacking skills to the Gentoo Linux project 
   and help the current kernel development folks improve the quality of the 
   Gentoo Linux kernel offerings. 
 * Web Developer -- Gentoo Linux is looking for web developers with a 
   solid foundation in either Python, Perl or PHP to assist in the 
   development and improvement of the infrastructure that supports the Gentoo 
   Linux project. Help with projects like mailing list archives, mirror 
   status tools and other projects that improve the robustness and 
   reliability of our infrastructure. 

Think one of the positions listed above sounds interesting? Then help out 
by volunteering your time and skills to the Gentoo Linux project. 
Interested parties can contact Kurt Lieber[3] for more details. Please, no 
resumes. We're not that formal. :) Just include a brief description of 
your background and qualifications along with what type of position you're 
interested in helping out with.

Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc3 Released
-----------------------------
  
The third and hopefully final Release Candidate of Gentoo Linux 1.4 was 
released on February 27th. Improvements to this release include updated 
LiveCDs and a whole raft of bug fixes. With this release, Gentoo Linux 
moves to a package updates phase as described in the official Gentoo Linux 
Release Policy[4]. For the next two weeks or so, developers will focus on 
migrating packages from a masked state to an unmasked, or stable, state. 
Users can expect long lists in their emerge -up world statements over the 
next couple of weeks as the backlog of masked packages is worked through.

GLSA: usermin
-------------
  
Usermin is subject to the same vulnerability reported last week for 
Webmin, in which a security hole could permit unauthenticated access. No 
exploits in the wild have been reported. 
 
 * Severity: Critical - Unauthenticated Access with Administrative 
   Privileges 
 * Packages Affected: app-admin/usermin versions prior to usermin-1.000 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge -u usermin, emerge clean.

GLSA: apcupsd
-------------
  
The apcupsd daemon for controlling UPSs exposes a remote root access 
vulnerability and some buffer overflows. 
 
 * Severity: Critical - Remote Root Access 
 * Packages Affected: sys-apps/apcupsd versions prior to apcupsd-3.10.5 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge -u apcupsd, emerge clean.

GLSA: vnc
---------
  
The VNC server generates a cookie for authentication in X using a weak 
random number generator. This could permit an attacker to more easily 
guess the authentication value and gain access to the system. No specific 
exploit is reported, but an exploitation technique involving rapid 
challenges and response comparison is described. 
 
 * Severity: Moderate to High - Encryption Compromise 
 * Packages Affected: net-misc/vnc versions prior to vnc-3.3.6-r1 
 * Rectification: Synchronize and emerge -u vnc, emerge clean.

3. Featured Developer of the Week
=================================
  
José Alberto Suárez López
 
This week we feature José Alberto Suárez López[17], a native of Spain 
who got started working with Gentoo when he had a conversation with Daniel 
Robbins about having a Spanish side (e.g. documentation, translation) for 
Gentoo. Now the editor and coordinator for all things Spanish in Gentoo, 
he also participates in the app-games team and maintains several ebuilds. 
His most recent work was the integration of win4lin with Gentoo, and he's 
also working on some artwork. José is also quite involved with OSS 
outside of Gentoo: he helped translate Mozilla to Spanish, does some 
development, some artwork for OSS projects, and participates in some local 
LUGs, like HispaLiNUX[18] and ADALA[19]. His proudest achievements include 
the integration of Free Software into his school's computer network and 
the creation of a Gentoo Spanish group.

 19. http://www.adala.org/
 
José lives in Sevilla, the capital of Andalucia in the South of Spain, a 
sunny and enjoyable city that he says is full of beautiful girls, 
including the most beautiful girl in the world. He studies graphics design 
in the morning and spends his afternoons in a crazy office working on 
embedded systems running Linux and other cool stuff. José's hobbies 
include music (recently he went to a concert with Lou Donaldson and Lonei 
Smith that he really liked), reading books by Lovecraft, Tolkien, and 
others, sports, and traveling. In his room, alongside a HiFi sound system 
and a bunch of CDs is his one functional computer, a laptop, which he is 
migrating from GNOME to KDE for political reasons. He likes Sylpheed but 
uses Evolution for job reasons, links and Mozilla for browsing, BitchX and 
gaim for messaging, and couldn't live without bash and mc.

1.4-rc3 out and about
 
Housekeeping in the forums is always a challenging job, but it gets really 
messy whenever a new release candidate is being put out in the open, and 
all the new kids come storming in leaving muddy traces all over the 
floor... Let's help the moderators by putting up a sign: Yes, 1.4-rc3 has 
been released. No, you can't upgrade from 1.4-rc2... How would you 
"upgrade" to anything that isn't already covered by your 'emerge rsync && 
emerge -u world' routines? If you want to help the developers, please go 
ahead and test the LiveCD images for the different platforms to see if 
they all work well for installations. Report your experiences, chat about 
the new release candidate, preferrably in the two top thread for x86 and 
the bottom one for PPC (notice the higher RC count, the Mac devs are 
riding a bit ahead): 
 
 * rc3 (in "Installing Gentoo")[20] 
 * 1.4_rc3 is out!!! (in "Gentoo Chat")[21]

Xfree 4.3.0
 
Equally eagerly awaited, the latest XFree86 upgrade has hit portage last 
week, only days after the ebuild for the release candidate 4.2.99.902 was 
distributed. Greeted by a thread that grew to three pages within 24 hours, 
the buzz in the forums is generally positive with a few quips here and 
there, and hope that bugs in previous versions have been ironed out. Real 
nice work by the XFree86 developers, apparently. At the time of this 
writing you still need ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch", but that'll change soon...

Commercial Applications Ported to Linux? Why not?
 
Why would the developers of Windows software not be interested in support 
for their products on Linux? After all, it isn't all that complicated, 
provided they try to assure some compatibility with the Windows emulators 
available. Or, better still, why not try to lobby them into awareness of 
the growing market potential for Linux ports of their software? An 
initiative centered around this idea was born in the Forums two weeks ago, 
but has gained so much momentum that it's been spun off into a mailing 
list of its own. Matija Suklje (aka hook[27], the initiator of the forum 
thread) brought it up to speed with an article on Newsforge that even got 
translated into Swedish. If you want to help exploring the possibilities 
of Linux advocacy directly addressing the vendors of proprietary software 
and drivers, check the original thread, Matija's article and the LCSP list 
at yahoogroups.com:

Gentoo releases and what they mean to you!
 
In an effort to stem the tide of "how to I upgrade to 1.4_rc3" questions, 
Gentoo Developer Troy Dack posted[32] a succinct message explaining 
exactly what Gentoo releases do (and, more importantly, don't) mean to 
you. The short version? emerge -u world. For the longer version, and to 
understand an issue that many users seem unaware of, read Troy's message.

Does gentoo compare?
 
Before slipping Gentoo the ring, Daniel Carerra asked[33] some important 
questions on how the distribution compares with the 'bigger' ones. How 
complete (# of packages) is it? How quickly do ebuilds follow new source 
releases? Is it as easy to update as apt-get? Can packages be created 
easily? Does Gentoo run faster? The unanimous 'yes' answers to his five 
questions made one thing clear; Gentoo is mature, and as of big of a 
player as any other. In short, Gentoo is rocksteady.. mon.

USE FLAG for DJB's daemontools
 
Christian Wiese proposed[34] a new USE flag "to automatically build 
packages with daemontools[35] support if possible". Rajiv Aaron Manglani 
asked[36] whether the support for daemontools would mean the creation of a 
separate set of init scripts and David Pavlotzky finally contributed[37] 
with a pointer to an article[38] about daemontools.

Italian Gentoo Forum Established
 
Just hours after the publication of the last GWN edition, the Italian 
campaign was rewarded with the creation of an official Gentoo Forum in 
Italian.[44]. In all fairness, it is only second to Gentoo.it initiator 
Enrico Morelli's Gentoo Italia Forum[45], preceding this one by about a 
month, but the official forum leverages on the huge crowd attracted by the 
English mainstream, and as a result is certainly more dynamic than 
Enrico's site at the University of Florence. Opening hours for both forums 
are fairly flexible, check in any time...

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Handling Files with Spaces
 
Many Gentoo users still favor command line tools (ls, find, etc.) over the 
newer GUI interfaces such as Nautilus or Konqueror. However, many command 
line users find that dealing with filenames that have spaces in them is 
difficult; especially when trying to automate a process or deal with 
multiple files at once. 
 
One common tool to deal with multipe files is xargs, which builds and 
executes commands from standard input. One example is using xargs to 
remove old files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful when executing rm as you can quickly delete things you may 
not want deleted. find will also search recursively - you can use the 
-maxdepth option to control how deep it searches.  Normally this works 
pretty well. However, if there are spaces in the filenames, we run into 
problems. The spaces are interpreted as breaks so each word in the 
filename is interpreted as a new filename - which of course is not what 
you want. 
 
The solution to this is to use the --null (or -0) option which changes the 
spaces in the filenames to a NUL character.

|# find . -type f -mtime +30 -print0 | xargs --null rm                    |
|or                                                                       |
|# find . -type f -mtime +30 -print0 | xargs -0 rm                        |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Note that you also have to tell find to print with NUL characters 
instead of spaces, hence the -print0 option.
