Gentoo Managers' Meeting Summary - 3 November 2003 
---------------------------------------------------
  
As part of the new management structure adopted on June 24th[1] of this 
year, project managers have held biweekly IRC meetings in order to improve 
communication within the project. As of 3 November 2003, raw meeting logs, 
as well as summaries of them, are now available to the public.

In the meeting on November 3, two issues were discussed: project status 
updates and portage-ng. The first concerned the fact that, while project 
leaders were doing a good job of disseminating status reports amongst each 
other, most developers and users were not seeing these and thus did not 
know what was going on, and that this should be addressed. The second, 
portage-ng, outlined by Daniel Robbins[2] at the meeting, is a strategy 
behind a replacement to portage that would be modular, and possibly have 
its core written in a language that would be "suitable for creating an 
expert system." To read a more detailed summary of the meeting or to 
peruse the logs, look at the Meeting Logs and Summaries[3] section of the 
Gentoo Manager Meetings page.

2. Featured Developer of the Week

This week's featured developer is Sven Vermeulen[4] (swift), the project 
lead for the Gentoo Documentation Project[5]. His duties include the care 
and feeding of Gentoo's documentation developers, updating and creating 
documentation and shepherding various documentation subprojects, like the 
GDP Handbook[6], a guide for gentoo users, which he is particularly 
pleased with the progress on. The current state (comprising the install 
documentation) is available as the Gentoo Handbook[7].

Sven lives in Bruges, Belgium, not far from the coast. He is a Software 
Engineering student at the University of Ghent. He also does occasional 
consulting jobs, manages a research group, and administers a local 
computer club. He has been a steady Linux user since 1997, when he started 
with Red Hat 4.2. He first became aware of Gentoo in early 2002. After 
some investigation he decided that "it could replace Red Hat immediately, 
with lots of advantages". One of the features he likes was that the Gentoo 
documentation was "actively being developed", in comparison with many 
distributions that "just write an install guide and stop". He describes 
one of the more difficult aspects of his job as encouraging discussion and 
making decisions about the way documentation needs to go, "knowing that 
your actions will upset some people, and make others happy". 
 
Sven noted that Dutch documentation was not yet being developed, so he 
started doing translations of the existing English documents and 
forwarding them to John Davis, who was then leading the documentation 
team. Eventually, John gave Sven and some of the other more active 
translators direct CVS access so they could keep the documentation up to 
date. When Gentoo's new management structure went into effect earlier this 
year, Sven was asked (as one of the more active documentation developers) 
to take over the lead role. 
 
Sven works on a laptop most of the time, but also has two desktop 
computers: a gateway and a development server. In addition, he has a 
4-computer openMosix array. He is a fluxbox[8] user (although he confesses 
to a fondness for larswm[9]). His standard set of tools includes: 
aterm[10], vim[11], mutt[12], slrn[13], mozilla[14] and irssi[15]. When 
not doing schoolwork or Gentoo documentation, Sven like to play Squash, go 
to movies, or hang out with friends in a local pub. When asked to describe 
Gentoo, he responded that "some call it source-based, some call it fast, 
some call it flexible, I call it adaptive", which makes him certain that 
Gentoo will continue to be a top player. Sven's favorite quote is from 
Einstein: Only two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; 
and I'm not sure about the former.

OpenSSL 0.9.7 Breakages
 
Progressing from OpenSSL 0.9.6 to the next minor release number was 
messier than most people may have expected, but it isn't exactly a new 
problem. The ebuild actually contains a warning that makes it perfectly 
clear what will happen, but hey, who reads those before emerging the 
world? As a consequence, several threads in the Forums had to deal with 
the repercussions of broken dependencies and how to rebuild stuff that 
links to the wrong library after the upgrade to OpenSSL. The main thread 
stands six months old towering over all the others, and conveniently 
including the canonical solution:
 
 * Howto for build openssl >= 0.9.7[17] 
 * Aliz' OpenSSL update shell script[18]

Gentoo on vservers.
 
Gentoo is already available on a wide variety of types of boxes, but as 
always, where we are is never the best spot! here[20] is a post 
questioning what needs to happen for Gentoo to become a viable alternative 
for vservers.

Beta packages site.
 
Like to know what packages have been released in the portage tree 
recently? Well look no further, packages.gentoo.org[21] has just started 
it's beta release. Don't worry if it's down, it is beta still so it will 
probably be up and down as it is perfected. Check it out! Check out the 
announcement on the -dev mailing list here[22].

New Russian and Greek Forums Online
 
A big step forward for the Gentoo Forums: Both Greek and Russian Gentoo 
users now have a support section of their own at forums.gentoo.org[23]. 
These being the first two in a future line of non-western alphabet 
languages supported at the forums, encoding and character sets are being 
vividly discussed among users and their moderators. As one of the Greek 
forum[24] moderators, Ioannis aka Deathwing00[25], explains, most Greeks 
are used to type in "Greeklish", a rather awkward way of writing Greek 
with Latin characters. Getting used to switchable keymaps takes some 
effort and isn't easily done, but a Greek Keyboard Howto is being prepared 
for inclusion in the stickies of the new forum. With the Greek still 
figuring out which way they want to go, their Russian colleagues have 
similar problems to solve. KOI-8R, the quasi-standard in Unix for cyrillic 
characters, is still dominant in Unix circles, an ever-growing number of 
people are demanding Unicode instead. Anyway, moderator Sergey or 
svyatogor[26] has implemented an automatic encoding detection for the 
Russian forum[27], thus alleviating the problem for both camps. By the 
way, forum moderators lately seem to have a tendency to live abroad, with 
only Slammer[28] actually living in Greece. Siberian Mihail aka ghuug[29] 
is covering things from West Africa where he's a sysadmin for several 
companies and running the Ghana Unix Users Group[30], while his co-mod 
svyatogor is in Cyprus (not exactly part of the Russian federation, 
either), and Greek mod Deathwing00 has been living near Barcelona since 
age 6... forums.gentoo.org[31].

Germany: Regional Gentoo User Meeting in Hamburg
 
After an unsuccessful attempt last winter to achieve critical mass of 
Gentoo users north of the Elbe river for a regional meeting, things are 
definitely looking brighter this autumn: The Hamburg Gentoo Users Meeting 
(GUM) is tentatively scheduled for Sunday, 7 December 2003, starting 
around 18:00 hours at the Schachcafe[32], a chess club and restaurant on 
the northern rim of town (S-Bhf. Rübenkamp). Coordination via the 
Forums[33], as always. Interestingly enough, the German forum has 
established a collective GUM thread[34] listing all regional groups that 
have managed to meet in the flesh.

8. Tips and Tricks
==================
  
Spell Checking with Aspell
 
This week's tip demonstrates spell checking a file withaspell. aspell. 
While aspell comes with it's own dictionary, it also allows you to create 
and maintain a personal dictionary as well. There are many uses of aspell, 
but this week we are just going to look at interactively spell checking a 
file. 
 
To install aspell, you need to install the app-text/aspell package and any 
language-based dictionaries you want aspell to check against (e.g. 
app-dicts/aspell-en). For a list of available dictionaries, use emerge 
search 'aspell-'. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Code Listing 8.1:                                                       |
| Installing aspell and the English dictionary                            |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                         |
|# emerge app-text/aspell                                                 |
|# emerge app-dicts/aspell-en                                             |
|                                                                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now that aspell is installed, you can use it to check a document. Start by 
typing aspell check file, where file is the file you want to edit. If 
there are potentially misspelled words, you will see the the file and an 
option window at the bottom of your terminal. In the option window are 
suggested replacements and some options like ignore, replace, add, etc.

When Aspell finishes, you will see file.bak created as a backup copy of 
your document. To view your personal dictionary, use the command aspell 
dump personal. For more information, see http://aspell.sourceforge.net or 
use aspell --help.
