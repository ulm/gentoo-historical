<body>
<p>
<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20030908-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri></b> you can read about the second Gentoo BugDay, which was another great success.  Also within are tips about using SSH to execute commands remotely (instead of just logging in), a profile of Thomas Pedley, the developer responsible for Gentoo on XBox, and a whole bunch of GLSAs.  Enjoy!
