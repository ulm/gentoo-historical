<title>Bootstrapping Awesome: Gentoo Miniconf 2012 in Prague, CZ</title>
<body>
  
<p>
If you've always wanted to visit the lovely city of Prague, here's a reason to
finally do it: On October 20th and 21st the city is going to be hosting numerous
open-source related conferences, including the <b>Gentoo Miniconf</b>.
</p>

<p>
This is a great opportunity to meet each other and hack on Gentoo together.<br />
We're going to have a room just for ourselves to discuss, give presentations and
workshops, do some ebuild hacking, and much much more.<br />
Thanks to the other conferences we're co-hosted with, we expect lots of local and
international visitors who can enjoy plenty of talks for all levels of Gentoo proficiency.
