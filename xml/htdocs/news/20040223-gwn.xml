<body>
<p>
<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040223-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> we cover FOSDEM Brussels, which took place on the 21st and the 22nd of February.</b>  We're also still looking for a dialup developer since no one responded to our call two weeks ago.  Don't miss our community coverage, bug info, or tips on converting between DOS and UNIX text formats either.  Enjoy!
