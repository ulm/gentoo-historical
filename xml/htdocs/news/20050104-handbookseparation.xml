<title>Installation Instructions Separated</title>

<body>

<p>
To be able to deal with changes after a Gentoo release, especially since the 
<uri link="/proj/en/releng">Release Engineering Project</uri> has decided to
use a semiannual release cycle, the <uri link="/proj/en/gdp">Gentoo 
Documentation Project</uri> has separated the installation instructions of 
the Gentoo Handbooks in two, one for the networkless installation approach 
closely tied to the <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/2004.3/index.xml">latest 
release</uri>, the other one for the <uri 
link="/doc/en/handbook/index.xml">Internet-based</uri> installation
approach which uses the latest versions of all available packages but does not
support GRP or networkless installations.
</p>

<p>
The differences only apply to the installation instructions; the other parts of
the Gentoo Handbook remain the same.
