    Gentoo founder and former Gentoo Chief Architect Daniel Robbins began a new
    position at Microsoft on 23 May 2005.  According to drobbins: "I'm helping
    Microsoft to understand Open Source and community-based projects."  While
    in the midst of hastily packing to move to Redmond, drobbins nonetheless
    managed to find the time to finalize the transfer of Gentoo's intellectual
    property (essentially copyrights on ebuilds and other software as well as
    soon-to-be trademarked Gentoo logos) to the not-for-profit Gentoo
    Foundation, Inc.
