<b>This week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050117-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> is centered around a long clarification of the guidelines for
usage of the Gentoo trademark and logo published last week. We welcome two new
teams of GWN translators, have set up a new distribution list for German GWN
readers, and report about upcoming events in the U.S. and the UK. </b> The Future
zone continues last week's coverage of project goals defined by Gentoo's developer
community, and the "Tips &amp; tricks" have a useful little helper for Firefox
users: a Gentoo bugzilla search plugin!
