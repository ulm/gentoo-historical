	<title>Gentoo Weekly Newsletter -- April 12, 2004</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040412-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> we ask for your patience as we reorganize the GWN team so that we're able to reliably bring all the sections to you, and possibly restore some sections that have gone missing.  We also send out a call for SAMBA developers.</b>  Of course, there's plenty of other content: a big crop of GLSAs, coverage of forum threads about X.org, some international coverage, a tip about shell autologout with TMOUT, and more.  Enjoy!
