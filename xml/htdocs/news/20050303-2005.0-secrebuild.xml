<title>Gentoo Linux 2005.0 Security Rebuild</title>

<body>

<p>
Due to a set of remotely exploitable bugs in gaim[1] and
mozilla-firefox[2] and locally exploitable bugs in qt[3] and kdelibs[4]
found in the last few hours before a final 2005.0 release was completed,
it was decided by all of the members of Release Engineering to rebuild
the release media to resolve these bugs, prior to release.
</p>

<p>
Release Engineering would like to thank the security team for their
diligence in making sure Gentoo has top-notch security resolution, and
also our Architecture Leads, for having the patience to put up with all
of the last-minute updates and changes, and also for their assistance in
quickly verifying these packages on their architectures.
