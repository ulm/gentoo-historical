	<title>Gentoo Linux ebuild freeze</title>
<body>

<p><b>In anticipation of a mid to late March release of Gentoo Linux 1.0, I've
institued a "freeze" on all new non-essential ebuild submissions.</b>  The
purpose of this ebuild freeze is to free developers from the huge stream of new
ebuild submissions so that we can focus on fixing bugs as well as adding
improvements necessary for Gentoo Linux 1.0.  We expect the ebuild freeze to
last at least a couple of weeks.</p>
