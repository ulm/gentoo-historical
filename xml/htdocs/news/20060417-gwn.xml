<b>This two-week edition of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20060417-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter</uri> carries a report from the Linux World Expo in Boston, news
about Python 2.4.3 moving into and the old-style PHP packages vanishing from Portage,
and an appeal by the Gentoo Forums administrators for additional help with translations
of new and old features in the latest phpBB version the Forum is using.</b> Italian
Gentoo developer Flameeyes gave an interview about Gentoo/BSD, German dev Kosmikus was
received in Japan, and several developers have left the project, joined the ranks or
changed their position over the past two weeks. All security announcements published in
April so far are here again, and the bugzilla statistics cover 14 days rather than the 
usual week. Have fun with the GWN!
