<b>The Gentoo security team is looking for additional members on all
levels, reports today's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20060327-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter</uri>. The graphical installer that debuted on the 2006.0
release now has a new bugzilla subcategory, and Ruby on Rails is in Portage.</b> 
Two threads from the Gentoo Forums could use your attention, a French
movie owes last week's theatrical release to Gentoo Linux, and this GWN also
carries the usual GLSA section and bugzilla statistics. Have fun!
