On August 7, 2007, bannedit reported
<uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=187971">bug 187971</uri>
regarding a possible command injection vulnerability within
<uri>http://packages.gentoo.org</uri>. The Infrastructure team verified the
vulnerability and the server was immediately taken down to prevent further
exploitation and to allow for forensic analysis.
</p>

<p>
The server hosted the following sites and services:
</p>

<ul>
<li>archives.gentoo.org</li>
<li>packagestest.gentoo.org</li>
<li>scripts.gentoo.org</li>
<li>archivestest.gentoo.org</li>
<li>kiss.gentoo.org</li>
<li>packages.gentoo.org</li>
<li>stats.gentoo.org</li>
<li>survey.gentoo.org</li>
</ul>

<p>
While no ETA is currently available, the affected sites and services will be
restored. The affected server will be rebuilt while the packages.gentoo.org
service's source undergoes a full security audit prior to being restored.
The tree and all other services were unaffected.
