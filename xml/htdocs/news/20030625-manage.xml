	<title>Gentoo Linux... into the future</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>The exponential growth in popularity of Gentoo Linux (as evidenced by
<uri link="http://www.novell.com/linux">Novell.com</uri> poll where Gentoo
Linux ranks second in popularity only to Red Hat) has certainly created its
own set of challenges for our project.</b> </p>
<p>
To address these challenges, Gentoo needs to
get organized.  Thus, a new proposed
management structure (in <b>draft</b> form) has been created, and is <uri
link="/doc/en/management-structure.xml">available online for public
review</uri>. This new management structure, once formalized, will allow
Gentoo to adapt to the challenges of continued
rapid growth while ensuring greater accountability to and communication
with its various user communities.</p>

<p>Please also read this <uri
link="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/9539">gentoo-dev
mailing list post</uri> which may help address questions you may have about
this new proposed management structure.</p>
