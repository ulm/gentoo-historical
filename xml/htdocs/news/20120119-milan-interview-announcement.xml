  <b><e>Milan is from Foresight Media s.r.o, who produce interactive Touch
      Tables, that run Gentoo Linux. One of the products are a low cost
      alternative to Microsoft's Surface. Be sure to check out an <uri
        link="http://www.simplemediaplatform.com/">overview of their
        products</uri>. Milan, thank you very much for your time. My first
      question is this:</e></b> 
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who is Milan and how did you get started with Gentoo?
    <ul>
      <li>I guess I'm a product designer, developer, entrepreneur and part time
        artist living in Central Europe usually in Vienna, Bratislava and
        Prague. To be able to create inventions, new gadgets you either need a
        ton of money or you learn how to do many things by yourself in a garage
        or in my case in my atelier. For me it would be quite depressing to
        â€˜just design' something :) And so I create prototypes, which I push
        into serial production like my touch table designs. When I was 13 years
        old I accidentally saw a magazine with a penguin. I thought it was a
        cool logo of something. Then I saw it said that there's a free CD of an
        operating system that I haven't heard of. I could not hack my
        pre-installed commercial software enough and so I gave it a try and I
        guess it's the usual story of many Open Source and Linux geeks from
        there on :) After some time using various Linux distributions I saw
        that the complexity and the number of regressions in many of them has
        become so high over the years that I needed a system that would let me
        stay in control and a system that would value it's own design. Gentoo
        was a natural choice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
