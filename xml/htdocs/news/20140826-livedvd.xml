    If you want to see if your package is included we have generated both the
    <uri link="/proj/en/pr/releases/20140826/x86-amd64.pkg.lst">x86 package
      list</uri>, and <uri
      link="/proj/en/pr/releases/20140826/amd64.pkg.lst">amd64 package
      list</uri>. 
	  The FAQ is located at <uri
            link="/proj/en/pr/releases/20140826/faq.xml">FAQ</uri>. DVD cases and 
	  covers for the 20140826 release are located at

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The LiveDVD is <b>available in two flavors</b>: a hybrid x86/x86_64 version, and
an x86_64 multi lib version. The <path>livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-20140826</path> version
will work on 32-bit x86 or 64-bit x86_64. If your CPU architecture is x86, then
boot with the default <c>gentoo</c> kernel. If your arch is <uri
link="/doc/en/gentoo-amd64-faq.xml#difference">amd64</uri>, boot with the
<c>gentoo64</c> kernel. This means you can boot a 64-bit kernel and install a
customized 64-bit user land while using the provided 32-bit user land. The
<path>livedvd-amd64-multilib-20140826</path> version is for x86_64 only.
