<b>This week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050411-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> has reports from the infrastructure teams, with the spring
cleaning at the www.gentoo.org website and a summary of the recent reshuffle 
of moderators and admins at the Gentoo Forums. </b> Developer SeJo from Belgium
is this week's featured dev, the UK community is off to an early start preparing
for the UK version of the Linux World Expo, and the press clippings reflect
mostly cheerful Gentoo-related publications during the last week. Enjoy!
