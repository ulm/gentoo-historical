Subject: [gentoo-nfp] Nfp paperwork approved
                                                                                
Hi guys,
                                                                                
Just passing along an email that the NFP paperwork was approved.
I am going to pick up several copies of the paperwork today.
                                                                                
This means that the NFP now officially exists.
                                                                                
Regards,
Daniel
