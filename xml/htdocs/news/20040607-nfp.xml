	<title>Gentoo Not-For-Profit Paperwork complete</title>
<body>
<p>
The paperwork for the Gentoo Not-For-Profit entity was approved by the State of
New Mexico today.  This means that as of today, the Gentoo Foundation is an
official Not-For-Profit Corporation in the United States.  Now the process goes
on to starting the process of becoming a Federally-recognized not-for-profit
entity, which will take about six months for approval.  Sven Vermeulen has been
tasked with drafting a charter for the newly approved Gentoo Foundation.
Assets of Gentoo Technologies, Inc. such as the gentoo.org domain, can now be
transferred to the Gentoo Foundation.  We're glad to see all the hard work that
has been put into this process giving some positive results and would like to
thank Daniel Robbins and all of the trustees for their hard work.
