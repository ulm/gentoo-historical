	<title>Gentoo Linux is improving support for virtual hosting websites</title>
<body>
<p>
In the coming weeks, the Gentoo Linux project will be releasing updates for
Apache and all web-based packages, to make it easier to use Gentoo Linux on
servers that host more than one website at once.

As part of these changes, the default location of the 'htdocs' directory - the
directory where your website goes - will change from <path>/home/httpd</path> to
<path>/var/www/localhost</path>.  For servers needing to support more than one website at                                                 a time, new tools - <c>webapp-config</c> and <c>vhost-config</c> - and a 'vhosts' USE flag
will be introduced to help with managing and installing web-based
applications and virtual hosts.                                                                                              
</p>

The full technical details can be found in <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0011.html">GLEP #11</uri>.  We'll be publishing webserver and virtual-hosting guides in the near future, as well as a new developers document explaining how to write ebuilds for web-based packages."
