	<title>Announcing the return of Gentoo donations via Paypal</title>
<body>
<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo
Foundation</uri> is pleased to announce the return of the Paypal
donation link on the www.gentoo.org pages.  This link allows
you to donate any amount you wish directly to the Foundation.
One of the responsibilities of the Foundation is to handle the
financial needs of Gentoo and to help fund the further development
of Gentoo Linux.  More information about funding needs can be found at <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/funds.xml">http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/funds.xml</uri>.
The most immediate funding need that the Foundation has is to raise the $500
opening balance for the Foundation's bank account (and this will remain in
the account as the minimum balance).  We challenge users and organizations
to donate if they can, even the smallest amount counts!  Thank you for your
continued support of Gentoo Linux!
