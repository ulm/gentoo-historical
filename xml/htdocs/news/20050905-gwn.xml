<b>The Gentoo developer community has elected a new council, writes
this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050905-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter</uri>. The PHP herd has found a way to let PHP4 and
5 coexist peacefully, and the Gentoo Forums policy of banning TOR users has
been partly lifted.</b> A little bit of everything is included in this
week's issue, starting with a developer portrait, updates from the
community at large, press clippings and a nice little trick to aid
with kernel compilation, plus of course the Bugzilla statistics and 
security announcements from last week.
