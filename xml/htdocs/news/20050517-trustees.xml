    <p>
	<b>Congratulations (and good luck!) to the <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo Foundation's</uri> 
newly-elected Trustees for 2005-2006.</b>  Turnout was quite good (45% of the 
nearly 200 Foundation members voted), and the Foundation's first member-wide 
vote appears to have been almost entirely problem-free.  Thanks to Aron Griffis 
for writing the "votify" and "countify" voting software, and to Aron, Mike 
Vapier, and Tom Martin for presiding over this election.  Detailed election 
analysis of this <uri

be found in  <uri
