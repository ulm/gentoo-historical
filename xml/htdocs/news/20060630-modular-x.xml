<b>
The X team has marked modular X stable for most architectures.</b> The x86 and 
AMD64 architectures will update to X.Org 7.0, and other architectures will move 
to 7.1. Those two architectures are on 7.0 because binary drivers were broken 
in the 7.1 update due to a number of planned changes to the ABI (Application 
Binary Interface). Some remaining architectures are expected to go stable soon.

To learn how to upgrade properly, read the <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/x/x11/modular-x-howto.xml">migration
guide</uri> before starting the upgrade. It discusses how the USE flags
changed, why X.Org went modular and why <c>emerge xorg-x11</c> won't be quite
enough.

Please file bugs at <uri>https://bugs.gentoo.org/</uri> for any problems you 
encounter during the upgrade. Modular X is composed of a vast amount of
changes, so there will probably be a few remaining issues during the first
couple of days it's in stable.
