<b>The Gentoo Linux 2004.3 release is the top headline of today's issue of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20041115-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri></b>. A new section, the "Future Zone", is starting this week with an article on the KDE split ebuilds project. The section will be published sporadically, looking at trends followed by Gentoo developers and casting spotlights on current activities pending integration into the official Portage tree. Other news in this issue: Gentoo's kernel packages underwent some weeding out, the X11 team is recruiting developers, plus reports and announcements from Brazil, Italy and Germany in the International section. Of course, the usual Bugzilla statistics, GLSA roundup of the week, new developer announcement, press review and tips and tricks aren't missing either.
