<b>This week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20041129-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> has news about Pegasos-PPC manufacturer Genesi starting to ship their desktop workstations with Gentoo Linux preinstalled, a new script repository for system administrators, and the availability of various non-English installation handbooks for the 2004.3 release!</b> The roadmap to the 2005.0 release gets outlined a little further in the "Future Zone" with a closer look at the current state of kernel development for the different architectures. Plenty of international news, press coverage and an exceptional two-week bugzilla report to make up for a mistake in last week's statistics repeated from the week before... Tips and tricks this week cover some interesting GUI frontends to Portage that may have gone unnoticed by many users, so we thought we might draw some attention to them. Enjoy your weekly newsletter!
