<b>The <uri link="http://store.gentoo.org">Gentoo Store</uri> has updated its
selection of clothing and schwag.</b>  The main addition is the new line-up of
women's clothing sporting the Gentoo logo.  This was done after requests were
made from a few <uri

users, as well as to help with the proposed <uri

project.  Also, some new stickers and other items have been added to the Schwag
section of the store, including a nice Gentoo wall clock.  Updated CD media will
be available after 2006.1 is released.
