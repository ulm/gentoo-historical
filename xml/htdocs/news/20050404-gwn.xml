<b>A relief to some, hardly suprising to anyone: GeNToo, the Portage spinoff 
for the NT kernel, was nothing but an April Fool's joke -- albeit a very well 
thought-out one. The various pranks played on users and fellow developers open 
this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050404-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri>! </b> Other features this week include developer portraits,
news from the community, a walk through publications who picked up last week's
release of 2005.0, and developers moves and additions, and the regular 
bugzilla statistics and security alert sections. Happy reading!
