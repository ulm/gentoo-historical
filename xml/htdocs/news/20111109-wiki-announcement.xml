<title>Announcing the latest installment in Gentoo greatness, the official Gentoo Wiki!</title>

<body>
  
<p>
We are glad to announce that the official Gentoo Wiki opens its doors today.
</p>

<p>
As you would expect it from a herd of proper Gentoo developers, we have spent
quite some time bikeshedding about various things concerning the wiki,
including the color. It seems we have finally reached a verdict, much to
everyone's surprise it will be purple!
</p>

<p>
Now, without further ado, we'd like to welcome you to our <uri
  link=" http://wiki.gentoo.org/?pk_campaign=launch">shiny new Wiki.</uri>
</p>

<p>
Feel free to browse around, look for answers to your questions and other cool
stuff to do with your Gentoo system. Do you think you have something useful to
share with other Gentoo users? Please go ahead and create an article about it -
or extend an existing one.
</p>

<p>
To help you get started, we've compiled <uri
  link="http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Help:Contents">some information on how the
  wiki works.</uri> If you still got questions left you can find us on <uri
  link="irc://irc.gentoo.org/gentoo-wiki">#gentoo-wiki at freenode</uri>, or
reach us via email at <mail>wiki@gentoo.org</mail>.
</p>

<p>
We are looking forward to your articles!
</p>
