	<title>Gentoo Foundation Web Site Redesign Contest</title>
<body>
<p>
The Gentoo Foundation has announced plans to redesign the various web sites
that are part of the Gentoo community with a new, universal theme.  Being a
community-based distribution, we decided to solicit submissions for the new
look and feel from our users.
</p>
<p>
We are officially opening the <uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/redesign-guidelines.xml">Gentoo Foundation Web
Redesign Contest</uri>.  This contest gives you, as a Gentoo user, the
ability to design the new look and feel that will be showcased on all our public web sites. The winning design will be selected by the community
via an open voting process.  For full details, please see our 
<uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/redesign-guidelines.xml">contest guidelines</uri>.
</p>
<p>
The individual, company or organization who submits the winning design will have the opportunity to post
a link to their own site on each Gentoo web site that utilizes the new design.
Our sites collectively receive tens of thousands of unique users per day,
so this is a great opportunity to gain exposure for you or your company.
