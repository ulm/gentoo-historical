	<b>A parting gift for the German Conspiracy,</b>
</p>

<p>
Gunnar Wrobel recently acquired the rights for his own book about Gentoo, and it
has now been published under a free license and is available for <uri
	link="http://www.fosdoc.de/downloads/OSP_wrobel_gentoo.pdf">download.</uri>
The <uri link="http://github.com/wrobel/book-gentoo/tree/">latex source</uri>
for the book is also included. Gunnar's intentions in publishing the latex
source was to encourage translations... it would be neat if that really happens.
Please take the time to <uri
	link="http://log.onthebrink.de/2009/12/parting-gift.html">thank Gunnar</uri>
for all the excellent work he has done for Gentoo.
