<title>Gentoo 2007.1 release canceled.</title>
<body>
<p>
Curious why only one release happened in 2007, since previous years had
multiple releases? Work began on the release as planned, but vast
numbers of security vulnerabilities between September 2007 and December
2007 and reduced manpower left the Release Engineering team constantly 
overworked, having to rebuild stages and add items to the initial snapshot.
</p>
<p>
The releng team decided just before Christmas to cancel the release and
roll all the effort into Gentoo 2008.0 since no possibility existed of
getting a well-tested 2007.1 release out before 2008.
