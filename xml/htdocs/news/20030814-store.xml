	<title>Gentoo Store incredibly (too?) popular</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>The <uri link="http://store.gentoo.org">Gentoo Store</uri> has been
extremely popular -- maybe too popular -- with hundreds of orders being
placed in its first two weeks.</b> We are working as hard as we can
to keep up with the unexpectedly high demand for Gentoo Linux 1.4 CDs and sincerely appreciate
the patience of all those waiting for their orders to arrive.
We will make sure that customers receive the absolute latest build of Gentoo
Linux 1.4 (including bug fixes) and our latest, most up-to-date docs
that are available when we assemble your order. We're shipping as fast as we
can, and sincerely apologize
for the delay and thank you for your patience as we scale up to meet demand.
