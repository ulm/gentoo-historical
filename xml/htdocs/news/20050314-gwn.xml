<b>Reports from several Gentoo events held over the last weekend,
including the Gentoo UK conference in Manchester and a Linux fair in 
Southern Germany, are among the highlights of this week's edition
of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050314-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter</uri>. Planet Gentoo, an aggregator for developer
blogs, has been launched last week, and the announced sales of the 
Open Desktop Workstation have finally begun, too.</b> A book by a 
Japanese Gentooist and yet another Gentoo introductory presentation
at a local LUG in Germany complete the International section, press
clippings from the UK and Germany show Gentoo's popularity again, 
and of course, our regular sections with excerpts from the developer
mailing list, the Bugzilla statistics and the GLSAs are part of the
GWN again this week.
