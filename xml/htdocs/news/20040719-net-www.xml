<p>
Week starting 2nd August 2004, we will be moving *all* of the packages
currently in net-www to new homes in the Portage tree.  net-www has outgrown
its original purpose, and the new categories that we are adding will make it
much easier for users to find the packages they want.
</p>
<p>
The full list of packages is available <uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~stuart/www-split.txt">here</uri>
</p>
<p>
<b>WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO:</b>
</p>
<p>
Portage will automatically upgrade any packages you have installed the next
time you run emerge -u.  However, you will manually need to fix any entries
in /etc/portage/package.* to refer to the new categories.
