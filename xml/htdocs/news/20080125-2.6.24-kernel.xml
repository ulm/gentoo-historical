<title>2.6.24 kernel targeted for 2008.0 release</title>
<body>
  <p>
    <mail link="dsd">Daniel Drake</mail> of the <uri
    link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/kernel/">kernel team</uri> announced
    that gentoo-sources 2.6.24 has <uri
    link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_150497.xml">already
    entered the tree</uri>. Marked ~arch for testing, by the end of February
    it should hit stable.
  </p>

  <p>
    If all goes according to plan, this will be the kernel in the upcoming
    2008.0 release. As with all software, it needs thorough testing to ensure
    major bugs get found and fixed.
  </p>

  <p>
    File bugs for any regressions you encounter in the kernel, especially with
    third-party modules because they tend to break with each kernel release. A
    <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207383">bug</uri>
    exists to track all of the 2.6.24-caused breakages.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're curious about many of the new drivers and changes in the kernel
    since the last release, Kernel Newbies provides an <uri
    link="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_24">extensive summary</uri> of
    changes.
