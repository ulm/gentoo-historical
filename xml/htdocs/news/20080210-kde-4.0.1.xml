  <title>KDE 4.0.1 added to Portage tree</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      <uri link="http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.0.1.php">KDE
      4.0.1</uri> recently joined the Portage tree, thanks to <uri
      link="http://kde.gentoo.org/">Gentoo's KDE team</uri>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the <b>first maintenance release</b> in the KDE4 series and
      fixes many issues in the initial release, including significant changes
      to the Konqueror web browser. These changes include stability bugfixes
      and performance improvements and its Flash integration as well as its
      JavaScript support.
    </p>

    <p>
      KWin, the window manager, has received improvements to compositing and
      error handling. Almost all other KDE modules have been worked on
      extensively as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>KDE 4.0.1 remains hard-masked because it still lacks KDE 3.5's
      polish</b>. If you want to try it out, follow our <uri
      link="http://kde.gentoo.org/kde4.xml">KDE4 guide</uri>.
