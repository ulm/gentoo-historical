<p> 
Gentoo Linux is proud to announce the availability of a new <b>LiveDVD</b> to
celebrate the continued collaboration between Gentoo users and developers,
ready to rock the end of the world (or at least mid-winter/Southern Solstice)!
The LiveDVD features a superb list of packages, some of which are listed below.

<p>
A special thanks to the <uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/">Gentoo
  Infrastructure Team</uri>. Their hard work behind the scenes provide the

project.

    <uri link="/proj/en/pr/releases/20121221/livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-20121221.iso.PACKAGES.txt">x86 package
      list</uri>, and <uri
      link="/proj/en/pr/releases/20121221/livedvd-amd64-multilib-20121221.iso.PACKAGES.txt">amd64 package
      list</uri>. You may also be interested in checking out the <uri
      link="/proj/en/pr/releases/20121221/faq.xml">FAQ</uri>.
	  There is no new FAQ or artwork
	  the 20121221 release, but you can still get the
	  <uri link="/proj/en/pr/releases/12.0/graphics.xml">12.0 artwork</uri> plus
	  DVD cases and covers for the 12.0 release; and view the <uri link="/proj/en/pr/releases/12.1/faq.xml">12.1 FAQ</uri>
  </li>
  <li><b>Special Features:</b>
    <ul>
	  <li>
	    ZFSOnLinux
	  </li>
      <li>
        Writable file systems using AUFS so you can emerge new packages!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The LiveDVD is <b>available in two flavors</b>: a hybrid x86/x86_64 version, and
an x86_64 multi lib version. The <path>livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-20121221</path> version
will work on 32-bit x86 or 64-bit x86_64. If your CPU architecture is x86, then
boot with the default <c>gentoo</c> kernel. If your arch is <uri
link="/doc/en/gentoo-amd64-faq.xml#difference">amd64</uri>, boot with the
<c>gentoo64</c> kernel. This means you can boot a 64-bit kernel and install a
customized 64-bit user land while using the provided 32-bit user land. The
<path>livedvd-amd64-multilib-20121221</path> version is for x86_64 only.
