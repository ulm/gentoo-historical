<b>The <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20041220-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> reports about Catalyst, Gentoo's release engineering
tool, and reiterates the urgent call for presenters at the UK Gentoo
event in March 2005. </b> Both Future Zone and International sections 
take a short break in this slightly trimmed pre-Christmas issue of the GWN, 
but Tips &amp; Tricks gets to introduce a tiny, very useful application, and lots
of press and community coverage are included, too. Due to the holidays, the next
issue will be published two days later, on 29 December 2004.
