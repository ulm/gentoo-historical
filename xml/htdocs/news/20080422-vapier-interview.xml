      link="vapier"/>, one of the most experienced and most active
      Gentoo developers, talked to David Abbott of

      Mike described his work on the toolchain (gcc, glibc, binutils)
      and embedded Gentoo, and he explained the short- and long-term
      goals of the Gentoo Council.

      He also told a story about how and why he got into Linux and
      shortly after into Gentoo, explained the origins of both his
      nicks, vapier and SpanKY ("<e>I came up with SpanKY because I
      needed something people would fear</e>"), and described his
      typical day ("<e>I wake up and keep programming until I fall
      asleep</e>").
