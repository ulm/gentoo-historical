<p>
As <c> forums.gentoo.org</c> receives its hosting at the 
<uri link="http://osuosl.org/">OSL</uri>, Gentoo relies on their backend 
database servers which have been upgraded to MySQL v5. Gentoo is following 
suit and forums.gentoo.org will be lifted up to v5 too.
</p>

<p>
The database will be shutdown and backed up, final consistency checks will
be performed, and pending the unforseen,  the conversion to full UTF-8 support 
is the last step. The forums will be shutdown during this time.
</p>

<p>
This activity is scheduled to start on 2007-09-08 and will take approximately
48 hours. The actual status will be regularly updated and shown on this
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/forums/forum-downtime200709.xml">
status page</uri>.
</p>

<p>
While potential problems have been assessed and many have been resolved in
advance, some fine tuning may still be required. Please be aware that it is 
possible that some posts may not be converted properly or that some users may 
not be able to log in afterwards. User name changes may be required for those 
using special characters. If you have any questions or problems, please send an
email to the <mail link="forum-mods@gentoo.org">forum mods</mail>.
</p>

<p>
If you have any further questions, before and after the conversion, please take
a look at this <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-578773.html">
thread</uri> in Gentoo Forums Feedback. As it won't be available during the
conversion, please visit the status page during that time or feel free to drop
by on IRC in #gentoo-forums on freenode.
