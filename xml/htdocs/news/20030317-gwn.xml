<p><b>rsync mirror troubles, GDC pictures and news about a hardened version of Gentoo Linux top this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20030317-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri></b>.  Additional information includes a list of open roles with the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter as well as new items available at the Gentoo Store.</p>
<p>Also, we've received several requests for more news in the Gentoo International section.  To do that, however, we need your help.  If you know of any user groups, international meetings, research papers or anything else that involves Gentoo Linux in an international setting, please <mail link="gwn-feedback@gentoo.org">let us know</mail> so we can feature it in a future version of the GWN.  And for anyone waiting for the article on how to become a member of the Gentoo Linux development team, it will be in next week's issue. (we promise!)</p>
