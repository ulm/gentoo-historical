<!-- Alter to your own likings -->
<p>
<b>Triggered by recent examples of bad behavior and dissatisfaction among
developers and users alike, the Gentoo Council has drafted a new <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~christel/coc.xml">Code of Conduct</uri> that will
be enforced for both developers and users.</b> The draft version of the Code of
Conduct is currently being discussed on the Gentoo-dev mailing list. To
subscribe, send an email to Gentoo-dev+subscribe@lists.Gentoo.org or read the
<uri link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_143434.xml">archive</uri>.

The Code of Conduct will be voted upon by the Gentoo Council Thursday,
March 15th; implementation will be immediate upon final approval. The
Code of Conduct describes what the Gentoo Council has deemed acceptable
and unacceptable behavior. It also describes the punishment that will be
enforced if the Code of Conduct is breached.

The Gentoo Council expects the Code of Conduct to end the bad behavior
shown by some and hope it will help Developer Relations enforce good
behavior among the developers.

The Gentoo Council has scheduled a Question and Answer session
Wednesday, March 14th between 2100UTC and 2300UTC in the #Gentoo-council
channel on the Freenode IRC network, irc://irc.freenode.net. We welcome
all interested parties to participate in the Question &amp; Answer session.
