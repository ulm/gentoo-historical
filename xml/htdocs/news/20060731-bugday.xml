<uri link="http://bugday.gentoo.org">Bugday</uri>, the amazing initiative for 
user contribution to Gentoo, has teamed up with several sponsors to offer you 
the chance to win one of many interesting prizes and give-aways when we celebrate 
Bugday's 3-year anniversary this coming weekend. What do you have to do to be in with a chance of 
winning? Show up in #gentoo-bugs on irc.freenode.net Saturday 5th of August, squash some bugs, have 
fun, contribute and learn! We'll keep going for as long as we can call it saturday in any part of the 
world. Prizes will include head-turning Gentoo-wear, books, gadgets, and a few surprises yet to be 
announced, as well as the chance to wim your very own Gentoo penguin!</p>

<p>When it started out life as GLEP 6 three years ago there was little doubt that the project was one 
with great potential to benefit Gentoo and strengthen the bond with our user community. We are proud 
to a community driven distro and Bugday has proven to be a great recruitment tool, an excellent way to 
get feedback from users and, of course, it has been invaluable as users come along and help work on 
our open bugs.</p>

<p>To celebrate, we will run a number of contests this coming saturday.
You can battle other users for the most solved bugs, most Gentoo specific knowledge, and other 
competitions.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on this week's GWN and on the <uri link="http://bugday.gentoo.org">Bugday website</uri> 
as it is updated with information! We'll be looking forward to seeing you in #gentoo-bugs on the 5th.
