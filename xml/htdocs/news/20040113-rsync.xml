<p>
We are currently experiencing some problems with the server that hosts the master portage tree for Gentoo Linux.  We are working to reectify the problem as soon as possible, but anticipate at least a few more hours of downtime.  In the mean time, please avoid syncing your portage tree via the <c>emerge sync</c> command.  Our apologies for the troubles.
