	<title>rsync mirror troubles</title>
<body>
<p>
We are currently experiencing some problems with the server that hosts the master portage tree for Gentoo Linux.  We are working to rectify the problem as soon as possible, but anticipate at least a few more hours of downtime.  In the mean time, please avoid syncing your portage tree via the <c>emerge sync</c> command.  Our apologies for the troubles.
</p>
<p>
<b>update:</b> Service should be largely restored now, though traffic seems to be high on most mirrors because of the outage.  The cause of the problem seems to be localized to some filesystem corruption on the root partition.
