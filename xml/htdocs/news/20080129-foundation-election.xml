  <title>Nominations open for foundation board of trustees</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      The election for the new trustees of the Gentoo Foundation is almost
      here! There is an open call for nominees; any voting members of the
      Gentoo Foundation may be nominated. That means any current Gentoo
      developer with at least one year of experience or any former developer
      who voted for trustees in the past is eligible. The election officials
      have published <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/elections/foundation-200802.xml">all
      the information on the election</uri> including a list of voting members
      of the Gentoo Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get more manpower to the foundation as quickly as possible, this
      election will have an accelerated time frame of two weeks for
      nominations and two weeks for voting.
