<b>This week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040202-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> covers the Gentoo Managers' Meetings held on the 12th and the 26th of last month.</b>  A number of issues were discussed at these meetings, including what could be done if developers had access to more hardware, and Gentoo Enterprise/Server, an enterprise-friendly version of Gentoo.  We also announce the next BugDay, which will be held on Saturday, February 7.  There's plenty of other content too, so do take a look.  Enjoy!
