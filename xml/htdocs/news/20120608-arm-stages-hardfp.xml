<title>ARM v6+ stages switching to hardfp</title>
<body>

<p>
From now on, we are defaulting ARMv6 and ARMv7 targets to hardfp.  Since the
ARM definition for these cores mandates vector floating point units, it would be
silly to continue defaulting these to soft float.  This also keeps us in sync
with the cross-distro standardization that is occurring in the ARM space.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, ARMv6 targets will default to "vfp" while ARMv7 targets will
default to "vfp3-d16". This will cause upgrade pains for existing installs, and that makes us sad,
but we're looking at the long term here.  Updated stages should be available
already.
