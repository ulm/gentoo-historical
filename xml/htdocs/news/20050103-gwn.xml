<b>A slightly belated "Welcome to 2005" from the staff of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050103-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri>, which this weeks draws your attention to a remarkable milestone: 1000 days of Gentoo
Forums! Congratulations to the moderators and administrators are followed by portraits of many of the
people behind that success.</b> Project updates on documentation and website redesign, and a call for additional
Polish translators and several of the usual sections are back this year, too: Gentoo Security, Bugzilla 
statistics, Gentoo in the Press, and to round it all up we have a look at the crowd of GentooJP, the
amazing group of Gentooists in Japan who met for their annual Bounenkai last week. Enjoy this first issue of
Volume 4 of the GWN!
