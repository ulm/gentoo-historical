<body>
<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo Foundation</uri>
has seen an incredible response to our call for donations to help with the
opening of the Foundation's bank account. We have far surpassed the $500
needed for the opening balance. We appreciate all of the support shown,
and will continue to welcome additional contributions to help fund Gentoo
development efforts.
