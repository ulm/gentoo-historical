<title>Google Summer of Code applications close April 6</title>
<body>

<p>
Students, only a few days remain to apply for Gentoo's 7th year in the Google
Summer of Code! GSoC pays college students $5000 to work full-time on an
open-source project for a summer. Check out our <uri
link="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/gentoo"> GSoC 2012
homepage</uri> if you are interested in this year's GSoC for Gentoo. We
particularly encourage applications from students who are new to Gentoo
development&mdash;many of our students become Gentoo developers after a
successful summer.
</p>

<p>
Interested students can browse <uri

6, so start now if you haven't already!
