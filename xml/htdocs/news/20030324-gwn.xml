<uri link="/news/en/gwn/20030324-newsletter.xml">This week's Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> sheds some light on how to become a Gentoo developer.
</b>
We also bring you information about changes to the way Gentoo Linux supports CFLAGS and the correct way to set your SYNC variable in make.conf.  Bugzilla, Portage Watch, Tips and Tricks and the rest of the usual crowd round out this week's issue. Enjoy!  Also, please note that, because of some scheduled server maintenance, next week's GWN will be distributed a day late.
