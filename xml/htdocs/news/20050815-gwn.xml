<b>The long wait is over, Gentoo Linux 2005.1 has been released last week! Learn
all about its features and where to get it from this week's <uri 
link="/news/en/gwn/20050815-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri>,
along with a report from the first Gentoo developer conference webcast!</b> 
Other events covered in this issue: The GentooSummerCamp in Germany and a
Free Software event in London, plus the regular sections with press clippings,
news from the developer community, and bugzilla statistics. Interestingly
enough, this must have been a safer week than ever for Linux security: for the 
first time ever, this GWN has no GLSAs to report! Enjoy reading.
