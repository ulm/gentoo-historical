<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040906-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> we introduce the new BugDay website, which lists bugs that BugDay coordinators have put together so that participants can spend more time fixing bugs than searching for them.</b>  We also bring updates on the Devrel, Releng, and Security projects, as well as community coverage and a profile of developer Deedra Waters.  Enjoy!
