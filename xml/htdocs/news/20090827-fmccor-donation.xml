<title>The Gentoo Foundation Board of Trustees Donate $500 to the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation in honor of the late Ferris E. McCormick, aka
  fmccor.</title>

<p>
All,
</p>

<p> Many of you have, no doubt, learned of the recent loss to the Gentoo
  community. Known fondly as fmccor, Mr. Ferris E. McCormick's death was tragic
  and unexpected. His many contributions to the greater open source community
  will always be remembered as well as his generous friendship. It is in due
  honor to his life and good name that the Gentoo Foundation has donated a sum
  of $500 to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The board of trustees
  believe that our donation is reflective of his wishes, given fmccor's
  professional life as a lawyer, and that this gift will further the movements
  he cared a great deal about, open source software and protecting our freedom.
</p>

<p> The board would like to take this opportunity to encourage any and all
  individuals that personally knew fmccor or were benefiting from his life long
  contributions to donate, in kind and to the best of your ability, either to
  the EFF, the Gentoo Foundation, or another organization that you feel
  expresses these ideas.
