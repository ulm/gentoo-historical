<body>
  <p>
    Gentoo's <mail link="kde@gentoo.org">KDE team</mail> added the K Desktop
    Environment's 4.0 release to the tree January 17, marking a new generation
    of KDE. The <uri link="http://genkdesvn.mailstation.de/">genkdesvn
    overlay</uri> made this fast addition to the tree possible. It contained
    ebuilds for KDE 4 since very early in KDE development by allowing outside
    contributions in an environment unconcerned with stability. In addition to
    the ebuilds, the overlay resulted in two new developers, <mail
    link="ingmar">Ingmar Vanhassel</mail> and <mail link="zlin">Bo Ã˜rsted
    Andresen</mail>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many features from KDE 3.5 remain unimplemented in KDE 4, so it cannot yet
    offer a true upgrade path. Since the software was also just released, it's
    hard-masked. To try KDE 4, please read the <uri
    link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/kde/kde4.xml">guide</uri>.
