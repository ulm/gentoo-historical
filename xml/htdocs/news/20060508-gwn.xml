<b>This week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20060508-newsletter.xml">Gentoo
Weekly Newsletter</uri> opens with news from Portage, better Ada toolchain
support, and an upgrade to Gnome's latest version 2.14 for Gentoo users.</b>
"Friends of Gentoo", the German NFP, have designed a small quiz for aspiring
power users, and there's plenty more: news from the developer community,
developers leaving and others being added, press clippings, the Gentoo Linux
