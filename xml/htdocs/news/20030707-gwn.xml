<body>
<p>
<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20030707-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> we say goodbye to Kurt Lieber</b> who is stepping down as editor to focus on other responsibilities within Gentoo Linux.  We also announce Gentoo on Cygwin and a milestone reached in the herds project, describe some infrastructure changes and a controversy about inappropriate content, and make another call for help with the GWN.  Enjoy!
