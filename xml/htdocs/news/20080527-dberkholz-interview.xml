  <title>Donnie Berkholz speaks with LinuxCrazy</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Developer <mail link="dberkholz"/>, who is a <uri
      link="/proj/en/council">council</uri> member, the X maintainer and PR
      team lead, spoke with David Abbott of LinuxCrazy. <b>Download the <uri
      link="http://linuxcrazy.com/?q=node/33">podcast</uri></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He described how he became a developer as well as his work on X, the
      council, the public relations team and the Summer of Code project he's
      mentoring for. Donnie also recommended <b>the best video cards if you
      support open source</b>. He saw the Linux desktop's future as increasing
      integration and security. Here's how Donnie described <b>how Gentoo
      makes progress</b> and where to go from here:
    </p>

    <p>
      "The more time I spend in Gentoo, the more I realize that <b>it's the
      individual developers who really drive most of our innovations</b>. They
      don't happen because the council makes a decision. They happen because
      the developer, or a few of them, think that it sounds like a cool idea,
      and make it happen. ..."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Making Gentoo great is my biggest goal right now, and <b>greatness is a
      process. It's not a place.</b> So you can't get somewhere and say you're
      great. You always have to keep striving for it. For a while we've been
      content to stick with the status quo instead of striving for greatness,
      but we have to change that and to always improve Gentoo."
