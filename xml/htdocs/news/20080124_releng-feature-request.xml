<title>Get involved: Suggest features for the 2008.0 release</title>
<body>
  <p>
    <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/">Release Engineering
    team</uri> members are in the planning stages for 2008.0, and they want
    your help! Is there anything you'd like to see added, changed or removed
    from Gentoo's release media? All requests should be something the Release
    Engineering team can actually accomplish, such as changes to profiles,
    stages, CDs or DVDs. They want to hear all your ideas, though limitations
    in time and mirror space mean they may only choose a few.

    If you want something changed in Gentoo's releases, come on over to the
    <uri link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-releng/">gentoo-releng
    mailing list</uri> (click the "Lists" link to subscribe) and join in the
    fun!
