	<title>New NVIDIA drivers and OpenSSH local root exploit fix</title>
<body>

<p><b>On the security front, a local root exploit has been found in all but the
most recent version of OpenSSH.</b> A fixed
<path>net-misc/openssh-3.1_p1</path> package is on Portage; be sure to upgrade
all your systems and then restart <c>sshd</c> by typing <c>/etc/init.d/sshd
stop start</c>.  This will not kill any existing <c>sshd</c> login sessions, so
it's safe to do while others (or you) are logged in.  Find out more about the
exploit in <uri
link="http://lists.gentoo.org/pipermail/gentoo-announce/2002-March/000125.html">this
gentoo-announce post</uri>.  You <e>are</e> subscribed to <uri

aren't you?  Be sure to do so if you want to receive the latest security and
other important announcements relating to Gentoo Linux.</p>

<p><b>Also, NVIDIA released version 1.0-2802 of their very nice NVIDIA Linux drivers
today.</b>  You'll find them on Portage in <path>media-video/nvidia-glx</path>
and <path>media-video/nvidia-kernel</path>.  You can find installation
instructions in <uri link="/news/20020207-nvidia.xml">this news
posting</uri>.  At the moment, there's one known quirk with the install.  Some
applications (most notably the <c>Quake</c> series) do not use the standard
library search path for loading <path>libGL.so</path>, but instead manually
dlopen "<path>/usr/lib/libGL.so</path>".  For this reason, make sure that
<path>/usr/lib/libGL.so</path> is a symlink that points to
<path>/opt/nvidia/lib/libGL.so</path>.  We'll be addressing this quirk
soon.</p>
