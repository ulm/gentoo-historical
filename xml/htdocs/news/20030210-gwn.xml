	<title>Gentoo Weekly Newsletter -- February 10th, 2003</title>
<body>
<p><b><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030210-newsletter.xml">This week's GWN</uri> has updates about Gentoo Linux at FOSDEM</b>, a new release manager for Gentoo Linux 1.4 and some insights into the man behind gentoo-sources.  GNOME 2.2's release into Portage happened too late for inclusion in this week's issue, but look for news on it in next week.  In the mean time, enjoy this week's GWN!
