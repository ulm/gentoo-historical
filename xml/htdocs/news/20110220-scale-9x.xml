<title>Gentoo at SCALE 9x</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org">SCALE 9x</uri> is almost here, and
Gentoo will be there!
</p>

<p>
Southern California's premier open-source software event is just around the
corner, running from Friday, February 25 through Sunday, February 27. Several
Gentoo developers will be there; it will be even bigger than last year.
</p>

<p>
We'll be showing off some nifty devices running Gentoo, and we'll be giving out
installation media. Whether you're a developer, user, or simply curious, be
sure and stop by <uri

See you there!
