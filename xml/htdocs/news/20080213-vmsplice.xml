  <title>Kernel security exploits: Upgrade ASAP</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Two <b>major security flaws in the Linux kernel</b> were reported last
      weekend. Both flaws have the same impact (<b>root access for local
      users</b>) and both exist within the vmsplice() system call, which was
      added to the kernel in 2.6.17. There is no configuration option to
      exclude vmsplice() so <b>everyone is vulnerable</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the security issues existed for the entire lifetime of
      vmsplice(), so any kernel version from <b>2.6.17 onwards is
      vulnerable</b>. This was fixed in 2.6.24.2, 2.6.23.16 and 2.6.22.18. It
      has been assigned the vulnerability identifier of <uri
      link="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0600">CVE-2008-0600</uri>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other security issue first appeared in 2.6.23. It was fixed in
      2.6.23.15 and 2.6.24.1. This vulnerability has been assigned <uri
      link="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0009">CVE-2008-0009</uri>
      and <uri
      link="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0010">CVE-2008-0010</uri>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.23-r8</c> and <c>gentoo-sources-2.6.24-r2</c> were
      added to the tree Monday and include fixes for both issues. Install the
      latest <c>gentoo-sources</c> as quickly as possible.

    <p>
      Gentoo isn't releasing <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/index.xml">GLSAs</uri> for
      kernels because of the huge amount of work to track them for all 18 of
      our available kernel sources and versions within each of those. If you'd
      like to help change this by contributing, contact our <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/security/">security team</uri>.
