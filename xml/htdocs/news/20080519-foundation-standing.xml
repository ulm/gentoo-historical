  <title>Foundation officially reinstated by New Mexico</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      If you're interested in the legal standing of Gentoo, you can relax
      because in the past week, the State of New Mexico <uri
      link="http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/cgi-bin/prcdtl.cgi?2463313+GENTOO+FOUNDATION+INC//">declared</uri>
      that <b>the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo
      Foundation Inc</uri> has returned to good standing</b> and is free to do
      business. This accomplishment allows other aspects of the foundation's
      work to proceed again. The foundation takes care of Gentoo's
      intellectual property (copyrights, trademarks) and money. It ensures
      that nobody violates our copyrights and trademarks, serves as a place to
      hold money, and decides where to devote that money.

    <p>
      Thanks to everyone involved with returning Gentoo to good legal
      standing, and thanks to our community for your patience!
