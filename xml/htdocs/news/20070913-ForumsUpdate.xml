After several days of being read-only the 
<uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Forums</uri> are back online after 
the upgrade to MySQL 5 and a full conversion to UTF-8. The upgrade took a 
little longer than expected due to some unforseen problems along the way, but 
the wait was worth it as all data is now in UTF-8 with very few conversion 
errors.

<p>
If you notice any problems with topics or posts that have been converted 
incorrectly, or if you have any questions or comments, please post them to the 
Forums topic <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-580709.html">
UTF-8 conversion feedback</uri>. If you have any problems with your 
username or with private messages please send an email to the 
<mail link="forum-mods@gentoo.org">Forums team</mail>.
