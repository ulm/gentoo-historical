  <title>New council elected</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      <b>Elections just ended for the <uri
      link="/proj/en/council">Gentoo council</uri> for the next
      year.</b> Turnout was 57% with 145 developers voting, which is
      quite excellent. The council, created by <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0039.html">GLEP
      39</uri> to replace Gentoo's previous hierarchy, decides on
      global issues and policies that affect multiple projects. To
      select council members, Gentoo uses the Condorcet voting method,
      which involves ranking them in order rather than just picking a
      single candidate. <b>Here are your new council members, listed
      by ranking in the election results</b>:

      All of the previous council members who ran again were
      re-elected, and the two new members are <mail link="halcy0n"/>
      and <mail link="dertobi123"/>. A <uri

      list of ranked candidates</uri> is also available. The new
      council members will get right to work&mdash;the new council's
      first meeting, scheduled for July 10, is approaching fast.
