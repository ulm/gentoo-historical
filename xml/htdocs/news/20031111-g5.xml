	<title>Gentoo for PowerPC G5 now available</title>
<body>

<p><b>We're proud to announce the availability of the Gentoo for PowerPC G5
32-bit LiveCD.</b> ISOs are available at
<uri>http://www.metadistribution.org/gentoo/G5/</uri> 
</p>

<p>The LiveCD has been
tested on a dual 2GHz G5 SMP PowerPC machine with 2.5GB RAM, a 1.6GHz machine,
as well as others. It includes pre-released yaboot-1.3.11 bootloader and a
2.6.0-test9 <b>benh</b> kernel. It runs at 100% speed, with fans currently also
at 100% (kernel developers are working on slowing down the fans when not
needed). Installation is possible on the SATA drives. We are now hard at
work to create optimized stages, and the store will carry G5 LiveCDs when stage
building is finished. Right now you can bootstrap your own G5-optimized system,
or use a generic ppc stage3 install with GRP to install Gentoo in 20
minutes.</p>

<p>We would like to thank <b>benh</b> (PPC kernel developer) for his excellent
work in supporting the G5, as well as all users who tested the ISO, and
particularly <i>IBM System Software researcher Eric Van Hensbergen, who provided 
fantastic test/debug help during the LiveCD development process.</i></p>
