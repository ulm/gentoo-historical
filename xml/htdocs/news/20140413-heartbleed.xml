<title>Action required: Password reset on all Gentoo services</title>
<body>

<!-- Alter to your own likings -->
<p>
	Recent versions of OpenSSL were found to be affected by an information disclosure
	vulnerability related to TLS heartbeats, nicknamed Heartbleed. It allows attackers
	to read up to 64kb of random server memory, possibly including passwords, session
	IDs or even private keys.
</p>

<p>
	After the public disclosure on April 7, we have confirmed that several services
	provided by Gentoo Infrastructure were vulnerable as well.
	We have immediately updated the affected software, recreated private keys, reissued
	certificates, and invalidated all running user sessions. Despite these measures, we
	cannot exclude the possibility of attackers exploiting the issue during the time it
	was not publicly known to gain access to credentials or session IDs of our users.
	<b>There are currently no indications this has happened.</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>However, to be safe, we are asking you to reset your passwords used for Gentoo
	services within the next 7 days.</b>
	You need to take action if you have an account on one of the following sites:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>blogs.gentoo.org</li>
	<li>bugs.gentoo.org</li>
	<li>forums.gentoo.org</li>
	<li>wiki.gentoo.org</li>
</ul>

<p>
	After 7 days, we will be removing all passwords to avoid abuse.
