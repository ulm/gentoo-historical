<title>Primeiro aniversário do the Jornal Semanal Gentoo</title>
<body>
<p>
Esta semana marca o primeiro aniversário do  Jornal Semanal Gentoo, cuja <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20021223-newsletter.xml"> edição inaugural</uri> foi publicada em 23 de Dezembro de 2002. Como o primeiro editor <mail link="klieber@gentoo.org">Kurt Lieber</mail> disse, "o Jornal Gentoo iniciou como uma forma de dar para a comunidade Gentoo uma fonte de informação sobre o projeto Gentoo Linux." Nós adicionamos, modificamos e retiramos seções e colaboradores e tradutores chegaram e foram, mas esperamos continuar a enviar a todos informaçoes sobre a sua distribuição Linux favorita.
</p>
<p>
Para celebrar o primeiro aniversário, esta semana estamos trazendo um conteudo especial. Primeiro, para aqueles que tentam imaginar quem somos, temos o perfil dos colaboradores e tradutores de quem pegamos algumas palavras e fotografias. Tanto no Desenvolvedor da Semana como no novo e semi-regular Entrevista com o Desenvolvedor, nós entrevistamos o arquiteto chefe <mail link="drobbins@gentoo.org">Daniel Robbins</mail>. Nesta primeira entrevista você saberá sobre Daniel e suas funções no projeto, algumas novidades que estão sendo estudadas ou desenvolvidas e o futuro do projeto.
</p>
<p>
Nós gostariamos de agradecer a grande equipe de colaboradores e tradutores que fizeram o Jornal Semanal Gentoo possível. Como sempre, estamos procurando por voluntários para ajudar o Jornal Semanal ser melhor; veja ao final caso esteja interessado.

<title>Desenvolvedor da Semana</title>

<p class="secthead">Daniel Robbins</p> 

<figure link="http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20031229_drobbins.jpg"
short="Daniel Robbins with daughter Tzippoprah" caption="Daniel Robbins with daughter Tzippoprah" />

<p>
In honour of our anniversary edition, we are featuring an interview
with <mail link="drobbins@gentoo.org">Daniel Robbins</mail> (drobbins),
the founder of Gentoo.  The interview is in a question-and-answer
format rather than our usual summary format, to give Daniel a chance
to speak directly about the distro, it's origins and where it's going.
</p>

<p><e>GWN: Tell us a bit about yourself.</e></p>

<p>
I was born in Montreal, Canada, and lived there until I was eight.
Then I moved with my mom to Brookline, MA (Boston area) where I stayed
until I finished high school. I spent most of a year at WPI (Worcester
Polytechnic Institute) before dropping out near the end of my freshman
year. I then started working, including a stint at Sony Electronic
Publishing. After that, I moved out to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where
I met and married my wife, and where we now live with our two young
daughters, Hadassah and Tzippoprah.
</p>

<p>
In Albuquerque, I've had various computer-related jobs such as serving
as a syadmin at the University of New Mexico. This is where I first
started using GNU/Linux. For the last 3 or 4 years, I've done a lot of
writing for IBM developerWorks, SAMS and Intel Developer Services,
which became a close to a full-time thing. For most of 2003, a sponsor
in Germany has been generously supporting me financially so that I can
work on Gentoo full-time. So now I'm now devoting all of my
work-related efforts to moving Gentoo forward.
</p>

<p><e>GWN: Could you tell us about how Gentoo started?</e></p>

<p>
I became involved in the development of Stampede Linux, but wasn't
enjoying the experience. So I decided to create my own distribution to
learn about Linux. Because I was working by myself, I had to make sure
that everything was as automated as possible, and that's when the
development of Portage began. At that time, Gentoo was called Enoch.
</p>

<p><e>GWN: Gentoo has seen a remarkable burst of success over the last year
or so. To what do you attribute it?  What challenges has it
raised?</e></p>

<p>
Gentoo had its initial burst of popularity due to a pro-growth strategy
I developed -- attract intelligent people to the project by making a
distro that they would like to use, and then get them involved. After we
reached a critical mass of developers, which caused Gentoo to improve
rapidly due to their efforts, our user community began to thrive.
</p>

<p>
Our community continued to grow because we were responsive to the needs
of our users, and genuinely helpful when users asked us for help. That
tradition continues to this day in the #gentoo irc channel on freenode,
which is where the Gentoo community originally began.
</p>

<p><e>GWN: What do you see on the horizon for Gentoo in the near term?
In the long term?</e></p>

<p>
For 2004, you'll see us move to a quarterly release schedule, and
transition to a new naming scheme -- the next release of Gentoo will be
called "Gentoo Linux 2004." Under the hood, you'll see the fruits of
several efforts to improve quality, organization and efficiency within
our thriving and rapidly-growing community project.
</p>

<p>
Organizationally, we will be moving to a not-for-profit organizational
model some time in 2004, and will continue to improve our ability to
develop and deliver innovative technologies to the public. You'll also
see portage-ng ("portage -- next generation") development begin, as we
work on a full community-driven redesign of our package manager/ports
system. Overall, you'll see Gentoo continue to grow and flourish.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this? We'll continue to have fun and focus on delivering powerful
free solutions to the public.
</p>

<p><e>GWN: What role do you think Gentoo plays (or will play) in the
broader Linux and Open Source communities as they gain more market
share and media attention?</e></p>

<p>
I think there is a tendency for Linux-related technologies to become
commercialized and "less free" due to the involvement of for-profit
companies, some of which tend to be more pragmatic than idealistic in
their day-to-day behavior. Their actions often end up working against
the "hacker ethos." In contrast, our efforts are focused on advancing
the hacker ethos, because we're all hackers. That's why people tend to
become quite devoted to Gentoo -- because they can see we're doing and
are excited about that vision. Having a thriving free software community
is more than just choosing the right license.
</p>

<p><e>GWN: Is there anything you'd like to say to the Gentoo
community?</e></p>

<p>
Thank you for using Gentoo Linux and please be sure to let us know how
we can make Gentoo better for you. Gentoo is what it is today because of
community involvement.

<title>Developer Interview</title>
<body>
<p>This week we're inaugurating a semiregular Developer Interview section.  Like in Desenvolvedor da Semana, this section will be based on an interview of a developer, but here we'll focus more on what these developers can tell us about Gentoo Linux and its future.  As it turns out this week we're interviewing <mail link="drobbins@gentoo.org">Daniel Robbins</mail> again; here's what he had to tell us:</p>
<p><e>GWN:
Thanks for taking the time to talk a bit with us here at the GWN.</e></p>

<p>You're welcome :)</p>

<p><e>GWN:
Your title is "Chief architect", but what do you actually do within the Gentoo Linux Project?</e></p>

<p>My efforts are generally focused on "stretching" or elevating Gentoo as a project in certain critical areas, usually technical. With a project as large and dynamic as Gentoo, there is often a lack of focus. My job these days is to get certain things on the agenda -- things that are
important goals, and may not otherwise happen if someone isn't pushing for them.</p>

<p>Because of my position on the project, I can push things forward that others may not be able to move forward by themselves. A lot of my efforts have to do with helping others to get their important efforts moving forward and bearing fruit</p>

<p><e>GWN:
With Gentoo currently storming on, and gaining popularity (Distrowatch.com labels Gentoo 4th most popular distro within the last 12 months), what do you think has made Gentoo such a succes. </e></p>

<p>A lot of things. From its inception, I made a very concerted effort to make Gentoo the ideal distribution for true Linux power users and developers. This allowed us to attract a lot of talented people rather quickly. We had a very liberal developer recruitment policy, which allowed us to grow rapidly.</p>

<p>When we had a lot of skilled developers who were making Gentoo better, a user community started to form. Our development team did a lot of good things to nourish this user community and be responsive to its needs. Because we took care of Gentoo users, a lot of Gentoo users seemed to get rather excited and started helping out newcomers to Gentoo as well.</p>

<p>Then we had another level of growth, where things like the forums really flourished. Users were helping other users, and this created a really healthy ecosystem for Gentoo, and this is something that we continue to enjoy today.</p>

<p><e>GWN:
Speaking of the current succes, you recently announced the start of Portage-ng development (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/manager/meetings/summaries/2003/20031103.xml). You outlined as a goal that portage-ng should be "beyond peoples' wildest expectations. Would you care to elaborate a bit on what we can expect.</e></p>

<p>You can expect all planning, goal-setting and development to be done publicly, with full accountability and involvement of our user and developer community. This is the only way we can approach a project as significant as portage-ng.</p>

<p>By making the community the key part of this process, and collecting their ideas and requirements for portage-ng, the result will indeed be beyond what any of us could have thought up all by ourselves.</p>

<p><e>GWN:
Gentoo 1.4 was released a while ago, what can we expect from the upcoming Gentoo release?</e></p>

<p>We're moving to a new year-based versioning scheme, so the next release of Gentoo will be called Gentoo Linux 2004. We're also moving to a quarterly release schedule, and all our releases will be built with the new catalyst build tool. Users will be able to rebuild the entire release using a stage1 and a portage snapshot. Our LiveCDs will be
user-rebuildable and tweakable, thanks to catalyst.
You can learn more about our plans at the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/">release engineering project page</uri>.</p>



<p><e>GWN:
When can we expect the change to kernel 2.6?</e></p>

<p>Kernel 2.6 will be supported as an option in Gentoo Linux 2004. We will continue to support 2.4 for as long as people need it. When the driver support in 2.6 begins to surpass 2.4 in breadth and quality, then we'll look into making a 2.6 kernel the "default" kernel. This may happen sooner rather than later, because the 2.6 kernel series seems to be off to a fine start.</p>

<p><e>GWN:
Could we expect a GUI installer to be developed for an upcoming Gentoo release?</e></p>

<p>I think this is likely to happen in late 2004. In the past, we've had several developer-led installer projects start, fizzle, and then die. Generally, this was because these installer efforts were pet projects of one or two developers and never really got support or interest from the rest of the project. People who work on installers have historically tended to be "lone ranger"-style developers, and a fair number of our developers don't really care about having a graphical installer.</p>

<p>Before we start another installer project, we really need to create some consensus about what our goals for the installer should be. Once we have a clear and inspiring vision for how the Gentoo installer should operate, it can be accepted project-wide. Then we can get a project organized and finally get a cutting-edge installer done for Gentoo that everyone can be proud of.</p>

<p><e>GWN:
Everyone cares about security these days, many distros now ship with a firewall enabled per default, Microsoft even started to compile their software with a compiler with stack protective measures (like ProPolice). What can we expect Gentoo to do in terms of encouraging safe computing in the near future?</e></p>

<p>The fundamentals include more use of GPG in critical areas of Gentoo and Portage and more organization and focus in regard to our GLSAs (Gentoo Linux Security Advisories.) But the key work in this area is happening thanks to several ambitious efforts being pursued by our <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/">hardened project</uri>, led by Joshua Brindle (Method)</p>

<p>There seems to be some indication that there will be a "hardened" version of Gentoo available some time in 2004, thanks to the efforts of this project.</p>

<p><e>GWN:
What current development in the Linux community are you most looking forward to?</e></p>

<p>My focus is unbashedly on Gentoo. Technically, I am most looking forward to Gentoo Linux 2004, catalyst and especially portage-ng. From a larger perspective, I'm looking forward to seeing our development team and user community continue to create, innovate and inspire. As a project manager, I'm most looking forward to watching Gentoo become more "professional" by adopting software development practices that allow us to drastically improve quality and user involvement throughout the entire project.</p>

<p>Organizationally, I'm looking forward to seeing Gentoo transition to a not-for-profit entity or entities some time in 2004, which will mark a new level of maturity for Gentoo as an organization.</p>

<p>Slow week for most of the Forums (except for a particularly untimely flurry of gratuitious flamemongering in the Off the Wall section). Among the more useful things to be posted was <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=35400">g-rem's</uri> howto for getting Macromedia's flash player to work in Linux on Macintosh - so useful, in fact, that it got replicated into the Italian forum right away:</p>

<p><b>Downtime and Upstream</b></p>
<p>With people cheering wildly at the reinstatement of the gentoo-user mailing list after four days of downtime, they seem to have encountered mostly non-Gentoo-specific development problems further up the stream, specifically concerning the odd Christmas install of a freshly minted 2.6 kernel:</p>

  <p><b>A move of development sources.</b></p>
  <p>As some people may be aware, the linux kernel recently reached version 2.6.0. As this is technically a stable release, the question was asked whether vanilla-sources in the portage tree should now point to these sources. Have a look <uri link="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/14633">here</uri> for the full discussion, including arguments for and against.</p>

  <p class="secthead">Linux Magic System Request Key Hacks</p>

  <p>
    This week's tip is about the 'magic' SysRq key that can be used to
    send events to the kernel in Linux.
  </p>

  <p>
    To enable the SysRq key, compile CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ into the
    kernel. To disable it during runtime, use <c>echo "0" >
      /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</c>.</p>

  <p>
    To use the SysRq key, use ALT-SysRq-&lt;commmand key&gt;. This
    allows you to send commands straight to the kernel that will be
    executed immediately unless the machine is completely locked
    up.</p>

  <p>Some of the many uses of SysRq are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kill all programs on the current virtual console</li>
    <li>Immediately reboot the system</li>
    <li>Sync all filesystems</li>
    <li>Dump memory info to the console</li>
    <li>Kill all processes except init</li>
    <li>Set the console log level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For more detailed information on using SysRq see the kernel
    documentation at
    <path>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysrq.txt</path></p>
