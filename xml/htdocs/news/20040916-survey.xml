<p>
The Gentoo User Survey has been released. This survey is meant to get some feedback from Gentoo Linux users and give us a feel on how
Gentoo is being used and what we can do to improve.  The survey should take around 10 minutes to complete and will be available through the                 rest of September.  You can register for the survey at our new <uri link="http://survey.gentoo.org/index.php?sid=3">Survey site</uri>
