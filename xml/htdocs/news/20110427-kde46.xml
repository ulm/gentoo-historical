<title>Qt 4.7 and KDE 4.6 going stable, finally!</title>
<body>

<p>
After a lot of bug-wrangling both by upstream and by our Qt and KDE teams, we
now feel confident that Qt 4.7.2 and <uri
  link="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.6.2.php">KDE 4.6.2</uri> are
ready for stabilization. If you are a stable tree user (amd64, ppc, x86), the
upgrade from current Qt 4.6.3 and KDE 4.4.5 will arrive at your machine soon,
with lots of new features. (The KDEPIM applications such as kmail, kontact, or
akregator will stay at trusty version 4.4 since development there is still
ongoing.)
</p>

<p>
As a special bonus, the stable upgrade will also include newer versions of
several popular applications that take advantage of KDE 4.6 features. These
include <uri link="http://www.digikam.org/">Digikam 1.9.0</uri>, <uri
  link="http://www.koffice.org/">KOffice 2.3.3</uri>, and <uri
  link="http://kdevelop.org/">KDevelop 4.2.2</uri>. There is a new bluetooth
framework called Bluedevil, we no longer need HAL, and, and, and... :)
</p>

<p>
The upgrade should go very smoothly; if you encounter any problems, we have a
specific <uri link="/proj/en/desktop/kde/kde44-46-upgrade.xml">Gentoo KDE 4.4 -
  4.6 upgrade guide</uri> to help you with that. In addition, there is always
the <uri link="/proj/en/desktop/kde/kde4-guide.xml">Gentoo KDE guide</uri> with
general tips and tricks.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to everyone who made this possible!
