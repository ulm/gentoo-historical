  Entering its fourth year of publication, <b>this week's <uri 
  link="/news/en/gwn/20060109-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
  Newsletter</uri> shows what's to be expected from next month's
  Gentoo presence at the FOSDEM conference in Brussels, and 
  calls for Lithuanian translators to help with the Gentoo
  documentation.</b> A portrait of Andrea Barisani in the 
  dev-of-the-week column, international news and press clippings
  are included this week, with reports from the community that
  had time to mature over the GWN's extended hibernation period 
  during the holidays and into the new year. The GLSA and bug 
  sections are longer than usual, for the same reason, with the 
  Bugzilla statistics spanning three weeks of activities rather 
  than the usual coverage of seven days. Welcome to our first 
  edition in 2006, and enjoy reading your GWN!
