<body>

<p>
<b>A new Unreal Tournament 2003 GameCD has been released and is available <uri
link="ftp://mirror.iawnet.sandia.gov/pub/gentoo/experimental/x86/gamecd/gamecd-ut2003-20030405.iso">here</uri></b>
as well as at similar locations on our various <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>
-- choose one near you.</p>

<p>This latest CD includes a highly-optimized gaming kernel (<b>really</b> helps
gameplay,) latest NVIDIA drivers (1.0.4349) with GeForce FX support, preliminary
bootsplash support, full autodetection of all hardware (sound/input/network,)
countless other enhancements and the latest ut2003-demo build. This GameCD
requires a modern NVIDIA graphics card to run ut2003-demo. Enjoy!</p>

<p><b>If you have a modern NVIDIA graphics card and want to play ut2003-demo on
your existing Gentoo Linux system</b>, then simply type <c>emerge ut2003-demo</c> and then
type <c>ut2003-demo</c> to start the game. I recommend using a 
<c>gaming-sources</c> kernel for excellent gaming performance and
responsiveness.</p>
