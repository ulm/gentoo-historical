Gentoo Linux, <uri
link="http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinports/">DarwinPorts</uri> and <uri
link="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</uri> are going to be working together
in order to bring free and open source software to the Darwin and Mac OS X
communities. A charter has been formed amongst the three parties in order to
coordinate our efforts. The intent is to provide Mac OS X/Darwin users with
collections of freely-distributable software. The final results will equate to
a large repository of source code patches and improved documentation for
porting source to Darwin and OS X. Visit <uri

information.
