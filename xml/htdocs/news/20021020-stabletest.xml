	<title>New Feature: stable and unstable/testing packages</title>
<body>

<p><b>A new feature has been added into Gentoo's Portage system</b> which
allows users to choose from stable and testing/unstable packages in the
portage tree.  For users who wish to opt for stable packges, nothing needs
to be done.  For users interested in testing the unstable packages (and
reporting to us via <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">our bugzilla
system</uri>), please make the following addition into your /etc/make.conf
file:</p>

<p><b>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch"</b></p>
<p>where arch is your architecture (one of:
<b>x86</b>, <b>ppc</b>, <b>sparc</b>, <b>sparc64</b>, or <b>alpha</b>).</p>
