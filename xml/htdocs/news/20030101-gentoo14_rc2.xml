	<title>Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc2 Released</title>
<body>

<p><b>Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc2 has been released :) You can find tarballs, LiveCDs
and preliminary GRP sets for x86 and PowerPC architectures at our <uri
link="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo/releases/1.4_rc2/">ibiblio
master mirror</uri>; files should begin propogating to our other mirrors
shortly.</b> Our x86 release includes builds for i586, i686, Athlon, Athlon XP,
Athlon MP and Pentium 3 systems, PowerPC support for generic PowerPC, G3 and G4
systems, and Sparc and UltraSparc support. We also expect the Alpha release to
be online shortly. We also have <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml">updated x86 1.4_rc2
install documentation</uri> online for your use.</p> 

<p>There have been a huge number of improvements since the 1.4_rc1 release, and
we encourage all users to begin to use 1.4_rc2 and the new "next gen" 1.4_rc2
LiveCDs as a basis for new installs. We plan to roll up a new release of Gentoo
Linux in 2 weeks time (est. 14 Jan 2003,) which will become 1.4_final or
1.4_rc3 depending on if it meets our "final" standards. All 1.4_rc2 systems
will be fully upgradable to the 1.4_final/_rc3 release when it is
available.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 1.4_rc2, both users and developers,
and have a great new year!</p>
