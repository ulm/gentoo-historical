<b>Important updates and how to prevent running into problems when
running along are at the center of this week's <uri 
link="/news/en/gwn/20050606-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri>, followed by plenty of other interesting news.</b> 
A Spanish project using Gentoo for embedded devices, the Dane behind
the Gentoo bugday, and a memorable Gentoo social event in Japan give
this week's edition an even more international flair than usual, and
most of that's not even from the International section. Which is of
course there, too, as are the press clippings, staff news, very 
little security and the traditional bugzilla statistics. Enjoy!
