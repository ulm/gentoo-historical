<title>Release Announcement: Gentoo Linux 2005.1</title>

<body>
<p>
  The Gentoo Foundation is both pleased and proud to announce the much anticipated
  release of <b>Gentoo Linux 2005.1</b> (Codename: 'El Nino'). Due to a scheduled power
  outage at the Open Source Laboratory (OSUOSL) affecting our master mirror, the
  release is currently only available for download via <uri link="http://tracker.netdomination.org/">BitTorrent</uri>.
  We anticipate recovery from the downtime and full staging of release material to
  mirrors within 48 hours, accompanied by a comprehensive press release and ChangeLog.
  Much thanks to <uri link="http://www.gentoo-ev.org/">Friends of Gentoo e.V.</uri>
  for providing a stable and reliable tracker on short notice.
