<b>A fabulous first European Gentoo developer meeting and the 
bustling atmosphere of the FOSDEM conference in Brussels last Saturday 
and Sunday, news from Apache and documentation for Gentoo/FreeBSD: 
The <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050228-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> is late this week, but hopefully worth the wait.
</b> Gentoo in the press still contains indirect fallout from the 
Boston LWE, and an interesting article about Gentoo in the enterprise,
and the community section introduces a new mailing list archive for
<c>catalyst</c> developers and users. Our usual GLSAs and bug statistics
complete the picture for this week, enjoy reading the GWN!
