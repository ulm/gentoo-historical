	<title>Announcing Wasabi - a custom log monitoring tool</title>
<body>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the initial public release of <uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/wasabi/">Wasabi</uri>, a custom log monitoring tool.  This tool was originally developed to help monitor the logs for our infrastructure servers.  Wasabi is designed to watch for lines matching user defined regular expressions and report on the matches via email.  Wasabi offers system administrators a great deal of flexibility in filtering log events so they are only notified of the ones most pertinent to their environment. 
</p>
<p>
As one example of what Wasabi may be used for, it can be configured to send a notification any time an invalid login attempt is made on a server.  It could also be used for periodific notifications of different alert messages. In tandem with a process monitor, such as grsec, wasabi could also be used to notify you of segfaults in specific programs.  Wasabi is written in perl and has been tested in a production environment that receives over 250,000 log events per day.  Feedback, bugs and feature requests regarding wasabi should be submitted to <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>
