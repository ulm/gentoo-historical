<title>Gentoo becomes Open Invention Network licensee</title>

<body>

<p>
This week Gentoo Foundation joined <uri
  link="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/about.php">Open Invention
  Network</uri> as a licensee. OIN is an organization which helps protect the
Linux ecosystem by building a variety of defenses against patent attacks. These
defenses include both traditional mechanisms, like defensive patent pools, and
more innovative approaches, like the Linux Defenders project, which uses a
variety of methods to pro actively prevent the publication of particularly
egregious patents. As a licensee, we’ll have access to OIN resources in case
we’re threatened by operating entities with patents, and over time we’ll likely
become more involved in providing our own ideas and resources to OIN projects.
</p>

<p>
Patents owned by Open Invention Network are available royalty-free to any
company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against
the Linux System. By joining, Gentoo receives cross-licenses from other OIN
licensees, but more importantly, for the long term, it affords us a chance to
work with OIN in reducing IP threats to open source development and innovation.
This may include a defensive publications program that would make it harder for
others to patent work created by Gentoo contributors, sharing defensive tactics,
and cooperation to minimize patent threats.
</p>

<p>
We believe that by becoming an Open Invention Network licensee, we encourage
continued open source development and foster innovation in a technical community
that benefits everyone. We recognize the importance of participating in a
substantial community of Linux supporters and leveraging the Open Invention
Network to further spur open source innovation.
