<body>

<p><b>Time to heat up those CPUs, Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc3 has been released!
You can find LiveCDs and stage tarballs
at our <uri link="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo/releases/1.4_rc3/">master mirror</uri>. </b>
Supported platforms include x86, PowerPC, Sparc and UltraSparc.  Additionally, the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml">x86 installation documentation</uri>, 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-install.xml">PPC installation documentation</uri>, and 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-sparc-install.xml">Sparc/UltraSparc installation documentation</uri> have all been updated to reflect the changes in 1.4_rc3.</p> 
<p>Many changes have been made to this version, with the most notable being significant improvements to the LiveCDs.  Due to the Release Candidate nature of 1.4_rc3, full sets of the Gentoo Reference Platform packages have not been produced, but they will be included in 1.4_final.</p>
<p>Support for 1.4_rc3-related issues can be obtained from the <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux Forums</uri>, the various <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">Gentoo Linux mailing lists</uri> and #gentoo on irc.freenode.net.  For bug reports, please check our
