	<title>Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc3 Released</title>
<body>

<p><b>Time to heat up those CPUs, Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc3 has been released!
You can find LiveCDs, stage tarballs, and GRP (Gentoo Reference Platform) sets
at our <uri link="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo/releases/1.4_rc3/">master mirror</uri>. </b> At this time, our release includes
basic x86 builds, PowerPC support for generic PowerPC, G3 and G4 systems, 
and Sparc and UltraSparc support. For this release, our documentation team
has worked hard to bring you updated <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml">x86 installation documentation</uri>, 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-install.xml">PPC installation documentation</uri>, and 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-sparc-install.xml">Sparc/UltraSparc installation documentation</uri>so don't forget to 
check those out for all of your installation needs. </p>

<p>There have been many changes since the 1.4_rc2 release, and we 
encourage all users to test and use this version. We have updated our
LiveCD installation system making it easier and more accesible, and we have
also refined our GRP installation system. As usual, if you encounter
any problems with the install, please check the 
<uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux Forums</uri>, and if
your answer cannot be found there, please check our
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bug database</uri>. </p>

<p>Thanks to all who have contributed to the 1.4_rc3 release,
and we hope to build upon this and have a great 1.4_final!
