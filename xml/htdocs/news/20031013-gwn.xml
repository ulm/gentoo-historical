GNOME users rejoice!  <b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20031013-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> you'll read about the addition of GNOME 2.4 to x86 stable.</b>  There can be some blocking issues if you're making the upgrade from 2.2; read the article to see how you can avoid them.  As usual, you'll also find a developer profile (this week we're featuring Donnie Berkholz, XFree herd maintainer and co-lead of the Gentoo Cluster project), community coverage, and a useful tip (would <e>you</e> know how to delete a file named '-foo'?).  Enjoy!
