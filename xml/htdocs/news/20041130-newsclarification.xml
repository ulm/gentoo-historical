<title>Gentoo Linux 2005.0 Story Clarification</title>

<body>

<p>
A <uri link="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39175014,00.htm">recent article</uri> 
on the Gentoo 2004.3 and 2005.0 releases contained a few errors to which quite a
few Gentoo users and developers reacted. Chris Gianelloni has worked together
with the ZDNet folks to fix all inaccuracies. We would like to thank ZDNet UK 
for their quick response in this matter.
</p>

<p>
Chris Gianelloni, who leads the <uri link="/proj/en/releng">Gentoo Release
Engineering Project</uri>, informs us in this article that the 2005.0 release
will provide a Minimal, Universal and Package CD, but that an experimental
LiveCD will be released for the AMD64 and x86 architectures containing a more
Knoppix-like environment.
</p>

<p>
The article also mentions the continuous development efforts of the <uri
link="/proj/en/releng/installer/">Gentoo Linux Installer Project</uri>, aiming
for a diverse set of install options, ranging from a graphical installation tool
to the possibility of performing an unattended installation.
