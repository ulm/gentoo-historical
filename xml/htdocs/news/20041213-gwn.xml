<b>The <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20041213-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> reports about the brandnew Chinese user forum set up only yesterday. </b> The Future Zone looks at all available or upcoming virtualization techniques in Portage or on their way there, while the Tips &amp; Tricks section introduces two great new tools for editing the USE flags and other system settings, <c>profuse</c> and <c>portage-prefpane</c>. Check the photo gallery from the Gentoo Christmas bowling event in Germany, and if you're in Tokyo around the 28th, don't miss the GentooJP year-end party!
