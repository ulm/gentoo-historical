    "Linux everywhere" is the motto of this year's LinuxTag, the largest European
Linux fair, which again takes place in Karlsruhe this week, 22 to 25 June.
The Gentoo booth (E121) is organized by the German NFP "Friends of Gentoo e.V." 
You will have plenty of opportunity to meet many of the German Gentoo developers
and discuss recent activites and upcoming changes with them. Gentoo merchandise
and lots of free give-aways are available at the booth, too. We'll
be happy to meet you at <uri link="http://www.linuxtag.de">LinuxTag 2005!</uri>
