<b>New management for the Gentoo store, now run by the Foundation
itself, the upcoming major European open-source community event,
the LinuxTag in Karlsruhe, and the Gentoo Forums being promoted
to regular staff with official Gentoo project status are this
week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050620-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter's</uri> main news. In the clipping section
several articles have picked up the story about Daniel Robbins
now working for Microsoft, of which we reference a few. </b> Other
international news, a lot of new developers to be welcomed on the
project, and the usual security announcements of the past week
and our Bugzilla statistics are also carried in this week's GWN.
Hope you enjoy it!
