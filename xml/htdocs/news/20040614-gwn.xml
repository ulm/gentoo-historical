<p>
<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040614-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> we tell you about the approval of the Gentoo Not-For-Profit by the State of New Mexico, and point you to an alias to which bugs about new webapp packages are being assigned, with the intent of letting interested folks get involved.  </b>Don't miss the usual security info, community coverage, or the tip about using noclobber either.  Enjoy!
