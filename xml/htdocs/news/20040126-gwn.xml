<b>In today's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040126-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri>, we'll tell you about the progress that has been made integrating SELinux into Gentoo: we now have experimental LiveCDs and stages from which SELinux can be built from scratch</b>.  While the online and international communities were relatively quiet this week, we have plenty of other content, including a profile of developer <mail link="svyatogor@gentoo.org">Sergey Kuleshov</mail>, a tip about using watch to repeat commands, and more.  Enjoy!
