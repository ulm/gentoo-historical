<b>This week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050110-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> carries news about added visual confirmation to the Forum user
registration (needed because of recent mass registration attacks), an announcement
for kernel version 2.6.10 being marked stable, and an outlook on some project
goals for the next few months. </b> Gentoo lectures at MIT, and a promising Gentoo
LTSP project at a Canadian elementary school are in the international news section,
and a handy tool for creating GUI menus in different window managers is being
covered in the "Tips &amp; tricks" column. And make sure you don't miss the 
article in last week's Linux Journal referenced in "Gentoo in the press"!
