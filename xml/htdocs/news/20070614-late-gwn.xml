<b>Feeling out of the loop without the GWN? Missing your weekly summary of
what's new and news worthy in the Gentoo community? The GWN will be back in
full force in July!</b>
The GWN staff certainly apologizes for this delay. As we are a community of
volunteers, certain set backs can inevitably creep up. New internal policies
and procedures are in the works, as well as cross training to ensure ample
coverage is always available. In short, we hope to not find ourselves in
this situation again and appreciate your patience while we strive for
improvement!
