	<title>Gentoo Weekly Newsletter -- December 8th, 2003</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>This week we have quite a bit to cover in the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20031208-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri>, starting with the string of security announcements beginning with the compromising of an rsync server and an announcement of what's in store for Gentoo in 2004.</b>  We also bring you an announcement about 'emerge rsync' etiquette, and point you to another article about Gentoo, this time from the Linux Journal.  You'll also see the bodies of the major GLSAs, a profile of developer Arcady Genkin, the usual community coverage, and a tip on backing up files with tar.  Enjoy!
