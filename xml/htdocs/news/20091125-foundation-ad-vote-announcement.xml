<title>Yes-No Vote on behalf of the Foundation</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo Foundation
	Inc.</uri> has been approached by a few large Gentoo users about purchasing
advertising on the gentoo.org side bar. They are not in the IT industry so
cannot support us in the traditional way, by donating their own product. 
</p>

<p>
The trustees anticipate that more approaches of this nature will be received and
view it as a sign of Gentoo maturing. Recognising that this would be a break
with tradition, by allowing even major users to contribute to Gentoo in this way
the trustees determined to put the question to a vote of Foundation members.
</p>

<p>
The recording date for the vote will be <b>29th November.</b> Voting will be
from 1 December to 11 December, to enable the result to be available for the
next Trustee meeting on 13 December. 
</p>

<impo>
To vote, your Foundation membership must be approved on or before that date.
