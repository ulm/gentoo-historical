	<title>Gentoo 2004.2-r1 x86 Minimal LiveCD</title>
<body>
<p>
Gentoo has become aware of a problem that many people are having booting the 2004.2 Minimal LiveCD for x86.  To combat these problems, Release Engineering has created a new experimental install-x86-2004.2-r1-minimal.iso image.  This ISO image is a recreated 2004.2 CD that was rebuilt to solve the problem of certain buggy BIOS versions not booting the Minimal LiveCD. You can find the install-x86-2004.2-r1-minimal.iso image on your local Gentoo mirror in the /experimental/x86/livecd/x86 directory. If you have any questions about this ISO image, you should direct them to Release Engineering by joining #gentoo-releng on irc.freenode.net with an IRC client of your choice.
