	<title>UT2003 Gentoo LiveCD Update</title>
<body>

<p><b>A new release of our Unreal Tournament 2003 Gentoo LiveCD is now
available</b> and includes quite a few enhancements. The Unreal Tournament
2003 Demo has been upgraded to the 1080c patchlevel, fixing numerous
quirks in the game itself. In addition, the UT2003 LiveCD now is now optimized for
modern systems, requiring a
Pentium Classic or greater to run and optimized for a P6-class instruction set like
the Pentium II and III (it was previously a relatively unoptimized i486+ CD.)
The CD now supports monitors with <e>and</e> without EDID functionality as well as wheel
mice. In addition, machines with 512MB or more of RAM can now cache the entire UT2003 Demo to tmpfs (RAM) 
to dramatically enhance load-time performance. Oh, and SoundBlaster
PCI 512 cards will now be correctly detected.</p><p>As before, our UT2003 LiveCD can be used to install Gentoo
Linux. <b>You can grab <c>livecd-ut2003-i586-1.4.1.iso</c> from <uri
