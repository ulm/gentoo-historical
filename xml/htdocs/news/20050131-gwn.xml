<b>This week's  <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050131-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> announces an initiative to include Trusted Computing support
into Gentoo, has a call for developers, hardware and architecture testers for
the AMD64 project, and talks about the release of the first GameCD for the
PowerPC platform freshly prototyped. </b> The Future Zone continues to look at
project goals for 2005, this week covering the Hardened agenda, and our regular
section Heard in the community is back this week with reports from the Forums
and the developer mailing list. There have been plenty of articles featuring
Gentoo in the press last week, all duly collected in our clipping section Gentoo 
in the press, and we welcome a number of new developers on the team, and greet 
those who changed their assignments in the project.
