<b>Announcing the launch of three major efforts: Gentoo Linux 2004, Portage-ng
and catalyst.</b> Starting with the next release of Gentoo Linux (Gentoo Linux
2004,) Gentoo Linux will move to a quarterly release schedule. More info is
available in the <uri link="/proj/en/releng/">Roadmap for Gentoo Linux
2004</uri>.</p>

<p><b>In addition, we're pleased to announce the start of development on
"portage-ng,"</b> the successor to the ever-popular portage package manager. Learn
more at our <uri link="/proj/en/portage">Portage project page</uri> and our
<uri link="/proj/en/portage/portage-ng/systemspec.xml">in-progress architecture
specification document for Portage-ng development</uri>. Portage-ng will be a
true community effort, and we encourage you to get involved.</p>

<p><b>And then there's catalyst.</b> Starting with Gentoo Linux 2004, all
releases (including LiveCDs) will be fully user-rebuildable using our new catalyst
build technology. Using catalyst, Gentoo users will be able to easily create
their own customized Gentoo releases, LiveCDs, GameCDs -- you name it.  The
<uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~drobbins/catalyst-20031118.tar.gz">current
development version of catalyst</uri> supports building stages and GRP sets on
AMD64 (both 64-bit and 32-bit x86), x86 and PowerPC. LiveCD/GameCD building
will be released by the end of the year. Keep up-to-date on catalyst by
visiting our (currently sparse) <uri link="/proj/en/releng/catalyst/">catalyst
project pages</uri>. Enjoy!</p>
