  <body>
    <p>
      <mail link="NeddySeagoon"/>, the newly elected President of the Gentoo
      Foundation's trustees, spoke with David Abbott from LinuxCrazy. You can
      download the <uri link="http://linuxcrazy.com/?q=node/26">podcast</uri>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked about recent challenges the <uri link="/foundation/en/">Gentoo
      Foundation</uri> faces, among other topics. You can learn about the
      reinstatement of the foundation, short- and long-term plans, a possible
      move to the Software Freedom Conservancy and answers to some common
      questions, like how you can contribute to Gentoo. On a more personal
      note, you can hear about Roy's long Linux and Gentoo experience, his
      hardware and the origin of his nickname, NeddySeagoon.
