<title>New Gentoo Monthly Newsletter proposed</title>
<body>
<p>

<mail>anant</mail>
recently proposed moving to a Gentoo Monthly Newsletter, giving us more time to
prepare high-quality articles and go through a proper draft and review process.
The extra time allows us to prepare statistics, aggregate interesting content 
from Planet Gentoo and generally come up with top-notch content, such as
features on the Developer of the Month. This happened as there were not enough 
volunteers to help with content for a weekly newsletter. Suggestions for other 
items the community wants to read are warmly welcomed; please 
<mail link="pr">e-mail us</mail>.

We encourage any users who aspire to Public Relations work to 
<mail link="pr">get in touch</mail> and help with this effort.
