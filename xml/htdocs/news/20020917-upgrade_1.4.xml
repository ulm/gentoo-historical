	<title>Gentoo Linux 1.x - 1.4 Update Guide</title>

<body>
<p><b>New guide for upgrading to Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc1 without reinstalling!</b>
The Gentoo Linux documentation team has brought you yet another great document! 
Thanks to the work of Road_Runner, Humpback, and carpaski ( he wrote the scripts), 
we now have a preliminary <uri link="/doc/en/upgrade-to-gentoo-1.4.xml">update guide</uri> 
to help you upgrade your Gentoo 1.x system to Gentoo 1.4rc_1. (The process is a
bit involved due to the C++ ABI changes between previous versions of gcc
and gcc-3.2.) Please check it out, and happy hacking!
