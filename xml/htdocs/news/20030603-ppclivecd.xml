	<uri link="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/03/05/25/2217237.shtml?tid=106&amp;tid=185">In a recent Slashdot article</uri>, someone asked if it were possible to create a fully-featured bootable Linux LiveCD for the Macintosh.
	</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	We thought this was a great idea. So today, we are releasing <b>two</b>
	full-featured LiveCDs for the PowerPC: one with KDE 3, and another with
	GNOME 2. Take a look at <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/images/shots/ppc-livecd/snapshot1.jpg">the KDE LiveCD running MacOS X in
	a window via Mac on Linux.</uri> 
	</p>
	<p>To use the LiveCDs, Simply boot one on your "new world" PowerPC and enjoy
	the great performance and functionality of Gentoo Linux/PPC. LiveCDs can be
	downloaded <uri link="http://gentoo.oregonstate.edu/releases/ppc/livecd/1.4_rc7/">here</uri>
	or at similar locations on <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml">our mirrors</uri>. For a list of what is included with the PowerPC LiveCDs, click on the "full story" link below.  Enjoy!
