  <title>Final step taken in migration to smaller, better Portage tree</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Each ebuild in the Portage tree used to come with its own digest
      file. When you emerged a package, this digest was used to verify that
      you had the same files the developer did.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days ago, all digest files were erased from the Portage tree in
      CVS as part of the final work to implement <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0044.html">GLEP 44</uri>.
      This migrates that information to a single <path>Manifest</path> file
      per package instead of one digest for every ebuild of that
      package. Portage hasn't been downloading these digest files for about a
      year, so this won't reduce the size of your tree again (it shrunk by
      ~200M at the time).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're still stuck on a Portage version in the 2.0.x series, follow
      the guide below on how to temporarily get Manifest1 files so you can
      update your Portage to the 2.1.x series.

      <b>Correction</b>: This was just the final step in a long-term migration
      that actually reduced the size of your Portage tree last
      February. Thanks to Daniel Drake, Petteri Räty and Jan Kundrat for
      pointing this out.
