<b>There's quite a lot of news in this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20040531-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri>, beginning with the announcement of beta LiveCDs and stages for PPC64, making us the first Linux distribution to make a fully working environment available for that platform</b>.  In other news, we cover some changes to the net-mail/mailwrapper package and sound a call for Gentoo/BSD developers.  Also, the weekly deluge of GLSAs continues, and we have some interesting news from France and Germany.  Bugzilla also returns, and we have a tip on implementing a command-line thesaurus using an online thesaurus and a text-based browser.  Enjoy!
