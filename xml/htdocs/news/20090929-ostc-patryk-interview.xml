We spoke with long time Gentoo user and head of OSTC Poland's IT department, Patryk Rządziński, to learn more about how and where Gentoo is used. We discovered, as you will read in the <b><uri link="/proj/en/pr/20090929-interview-patryk-ostc.xml">full interview</uri></b>, that Gentoo, and more generally open source software, serves well in the commercial world.
