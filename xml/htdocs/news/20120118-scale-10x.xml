<title>Gentoo at SCALE 10x</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org">SCALE 10x</uri> is almost here, and
Gentoo will be there!
</p>

<p>
Southern California's premier open-source software event is just around the
corner, running from Friday, January 20 through Sunday, January 22. Several
Gentoo developers will be there; it will be even bigger than previous years.
</p>

<p>
We'll be showing off some nifty devices running Gentoo, and we'll be giving out
installation media. Whether you're a developer, user, or simply curious, be sure
to stop by <uri

See you there!
