<title>Trusted Gentoo</title>

<body>

<p>
Trusted Gentoo was a concept brought out by realizing that Trusted Computing 
Group (TCG - formerly known as Trusted Computing Platform Alliance or TCPA) 
architecture can provide Gentoo with the ability to give our users a hardened
platform and a choice of utilizing hardware. The way that TCG provides a hardened 
platform is by keeping cryptographic <e>processing</e> in hardware and 
cryptographic <e>keys</e> out of RAM and disks. It also allows keys to be provided 
to only user-specified programs.
</p>

<p>
Trusted Gentoo will give users the choice to set up their hardware to verify 
that their kernels are loaded on bootup and not some hacked ones that someone 
installed when they left their computers alone for the night. Trusted Gentoo will 
give users the ability to store their cryptographic keys (e.g. ssh keys, gnupg keys) 
in hardware to be released only to those applications the user wants the keys given 
to.  The concept of installing remote trojans to steal crytographic keys and passwords is hard to 
imagine but not impossible in all setups. The use of TCG architecture will empower 
the user to deny providing keys to trojans.
</p>

<p>
There is no intent for Gentoo to use of the TCG architecture for any purpose other 
than what the user wants -- a secure, still-flexible operating system. Gentoo 
is about choice, and this is no exception. For a clarification of DRM and 
TCG, see <uri link="http://www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa/tcpa_rebuttal.pdf">this 
article by IBM</uri>.
