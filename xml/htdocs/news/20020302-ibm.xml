	<title>OpenSSH key management, Part 3</title>
<body>

<p><b><uri
link="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-keyc3/">Part 3 of
my OpenSSH key management series</uri> has appeared on IBM developerWorks.</b>
In it, I introduce OpenSSH's authentication agent forwarding abilities, which
allow you to take advantage of an <c>ssh-agent</c> running on another, more
trusted system.  Authentication forwarding comes in really handy for making
secure, passwordless connections from systems that may be vulnerable to security
breaches.  Thanks to Charles Karney of Sarnoff Corporation for introducing
OpenSSH's authentication forwarding features to me.
