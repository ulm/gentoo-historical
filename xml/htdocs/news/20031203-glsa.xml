<b>Gentoo rsync.gentoo.org server compromised.</b> 
On 2 December at approximately 03:45 UTC, one of the servers that makes
up the rsync.gentoo.org rotation was compromised via a remote exploit.
However, the compromised system had both an IDS and a file integrity
checker installed and we have a very detailed forensic trail of what
happened once the box was breached, so <e>we are reasonably confident that the
	portage tree stored on the box was unaffected</e>.  This box has been
removed from all rsync.*.gentoo.org rotations and will remain so until
forensic analysis has been completed and it has been wiped and rebuilt.
