  <title>MIPS becoming an experimental architecture</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      <b>Stable MIPS keywords have been lagging</b> behind other
      architectures, in part because the <uri
      link="http://mips.gentoo.org/">Gentoo MIPS team</uri> is understaffed.
    </p>

    <p>
      To better serve its users, the MIPS team decided to make MIPS an
      experimental architecture. This means stable mips keywords will
      gradually disappear, so <b>all MIPS users will eventually need to add
      ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~mips" in</b> <path>/etc/make.conf</path>. Stable mips
      keywords will remain in ebuilds they're already in, but they will not be
      added to any new ebuild revisions. MIPS profiles will only accept ~mips
      keywords starting with <uri
      link="/proj/en/releng/release/2008.0/index.xml">2008.0</uri>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org">file bugs</uri> for any
      problems you encounter during this period of transition. <b>To help the
      MIPS team</b>, contact team lead <mail link="kumba">Joshua
      Kinard</mail>.
