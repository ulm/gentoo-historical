<b>In this week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20031208-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri>, we cover the Gentoo Managers' Meeting held on the 1st of December.</b>  The managers discussed the new release naming scheme which takes effect next year, as well as the implementation of GLEP 14, which is designed to check a system for identified security holes and auto-apply fixes.  We also profile developer Robin Hugh Johnson, give you a tip about using ls, and bring you plenty of other content too.  Enjoy!
