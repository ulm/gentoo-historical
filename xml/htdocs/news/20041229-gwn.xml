<b>The 52nd and last issue in 2004 of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20041229-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> celebrates its own second anniversary since the very first issue was published on 23
December 2002! We're looking back on another exciting year of major events for Gentoo Linux and its 
users. Author and translator profiles give transparency to who's behind the GWN, the Bugzilla statistics 
cover the entire year 2004 rather than the usual weekly overview. </b> This week's Future Zone looks at 
the new Qt making inroads to Portage, community coverage and press clippings are included, too, and 
last but not least several new developers have joined the team - right on time to move on to 2005!
