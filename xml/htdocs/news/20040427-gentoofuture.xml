	<title>The Future of Gentoo Linux</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>The departure of Daniel Robbins as the Chief Architect of Gentoo Linux will
undoubtedly be felt by the project.  Daniel was a key contributor to the
Gentoo Linux project and his contributions will be missed by many.
</b>
</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously, Gentoo Technologies is in the process of becoming
an official 501(c)(6) Not For Profit organization.  This will place the
stewardship of Gentoo Linux into the hands of a Board of Trustees, who will
act as gentle caretakers of Gentoo.
</p>
<p>
This Board, along with the team of approximately 200 Gentoo developers,
will ensure that the development of Gentoo Linux continues unabated.  As
has been the case for some time, Gentoo Linux is far bigger than any one
person.  It is made up of the contributions of literally tens of thousands
of people that comprise the Gentoo User Community.  The greatest strength
of Gentoo Linux has always been our oustanding community.  This key
strength, moreso than any other, is what will ensure Gentoo Linux continues
as a vibrant, exciting Linux distribution far into the future.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who may be concerned with the uncertainty brought on by this
transition, we remind you that the key to our success lies in your hands as a
member of the Gentoo community.  We have always and will always be as
successful as you make us.  Thus, you can ensure the continued success of
Gentoo Linux by continuing to test ebuilds, help fix bugs on bugzilla,
contribute to documentation, participate on the forums and any of the other
myriad of tasks that make up Gentoo Linux.

<p>
Thank you for continuing to support Gentoo Linux
