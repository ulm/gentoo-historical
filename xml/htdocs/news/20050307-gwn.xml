<b>News from the release building effort for 2005.0, infrastructure
moves and changes, a heads-up for shifting <path>sys-apps</path> in
the tree and a call for business user testimonials dominate this 
week's <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050307-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter</uri>.</b> The featured developer section is back from several
months of hiatus, this week with the maintainer of Gentoo's package database
site, and the Gentoo International section carries two important reminders 
for shows in the UK and Germany next weekend, and a report from another
expo in Germany that closed yesterday. Starting this week, the GWN
has moved the security announcements and the Bugzilla statistics to the 
end of the newsletter, and besides the Gentoo in the press clippings we 
also have a tip on using <c>emerge</c> in clever ways you may not be 
familiar with.
