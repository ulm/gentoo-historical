  <title>Summer of Code deadline pushed back to April 7</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Thanks to overwhelming support from the open-source community,
      Google extended the deadline for student applications until
      <b>April 7</b>. If you'd like to spend your summer being paid by
      Google to work on Gentoo, <b>this is your chance</b>. This gives
      you until next Monday to work on your project idea. If you
      haven't yet submitted an application, now is the time. Students
      have submitted many interesting and unique ideas so far, and
      <b>there's still room for your ideas</b>. For more details, see
      our <uri link="/proj/en/userrel/soc/">Summer of Code page</uri>.
