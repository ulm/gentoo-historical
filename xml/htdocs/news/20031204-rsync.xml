	<title>GLSA: remotely exploitable rsync 2.5.6 buffer overflow</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>A new <uri link="/security/en/glsa/glsa-200312-03.xml">GLSA has been
released</uri> to address a remotely-exploitable rsync buffer overflow.</b>
This vulnerability may have recently been used to compromise one of Gentoo's
<uri link="/security/en/glsa/glsa-200312-01.xml">rsync rotation servers</uri>.
Please also be sure to read <uri link="/security/en/glsa/glsa-200312-02">GLSA-200312-02</uri>
and upgrade to kernels without the brk vulnerability.</p>

<p>In regards to the hard work involved in logging, tracking down and fixing
this rsync vulnerability, Gentoo would like to extend thanks to Andrea
Barisani, Nedd Ludd, Kurt Lieber, and Corey Shields (of the Gentoo
Infrastructure team,) Michael Warfield and the <uri
link="http://www.iss.net">ISS</uri> team, and the rsync development team for
handling the recent issues. A special thanks goes to Dave Monnier, Lead
Security Engineer for the Information Technology Security Office of Indiana
University, and his team, for their assistance as well.</p>
