	<title>Announcing the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</title>
<body>

<p><b><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20021223-newsletter.xml">The
Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri> is intended to give users of Gentoo one
source of information about Gentoo. The GWN summarizes the key events in
the Gentoo Linux project each week and presents them in a clear, concise
format. </b>With sections covering general news, security, bugs, portage and
other topics, the GWN should offer something for everyone.</p>

<p>Initially, the GWN will be distributed via web and mailing list formats,
with additional formats being considered based on your feedback. To
subscribe to the GWN mailing list, send a blank email to
<mail link="gentoo-gwn-subscribe@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-subscribe@gentoo.org</mail>. The GWN will also be
available in English and Spanish, with other languages becoming available
as translators join the team.</p>

<p>Finally, we'd like to thank the 10 volunteers who made this first issue of
the GWN possible. If you're interested in joining the GWN team, please
send an email to <mail>gwn-feedback@gentoo.org</mail>.</p>
