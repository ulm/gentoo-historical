<b>What:</b> Gentoo 10 Year Anniversary Party
</p>

<p>
<b>Where:</b> irc.freenode.net, #gentoo-birthday
</p>

<p>
<b>When:</b> Sun, 2009-10-04, in a timezone near you
</p>

<p>
<b>Introduction:</b>
</p>

<p>
Gentoo is turning 10. For the last ten years, Gentoo has been committed to
bringing the cutting edge source based distro to users that need more
flexibility than binary packages can give them. With a vibrant community and
over 300 developers, much has been accomplished since the beginning, Gentoo
remains true to its origin.  </p>

<p>
<b>History:</b>
</p>

<p>
The anniversary date of 1999-10-04 was decided on by a couple of key dates in
Gentoo's history. The name Enoch was changed to Gentoo and the domain name
gentoo.org was registered. The founder of Gentoo Daniel Robbins, gives us this
chronology.  </p>

<ul>
<li>1997-07 : Started a new position at University of New Mexico, was using
    Debian 1.3</li> <li>1998-11 : Was using/developing for Stampede Linux at
    home, but had not (yet) started Enoch?</li>

    Achim Gottinger kept Enoch going.</li> <li>1999-10-04 : Domain name
    gentoo.org registered.</li>
<li>1999-Late :  Must have came back to Enoch and done the Gentoo name change
    right about now - the "Gentoo" name was Bob Mutch's idea - started
    incorporating some FreeBSD ideas into Enoch - Portage (as we know it today)
    was born.</li> <li>2000-07-26 :  Gentoo 1.0 release "imminent", cvs online,
    rsync "coming soon"</li>

<p by="Daniel Robbins">
So, we're thinking of calling late 2009 the official 10th anniversary of the
birth of Gentoo - whaddya think? If it sounds good, we need to get the party
planning committee together...  </p>
