  Fight Night</uri>, so $400 US was donated to the Gentoo Foundation to pay for
Gentoo Development and Services, etc.
</p>

<p>
Vilhelm I believe made the suggestion to the others to play for Gentoo and they
accepted.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Hi Vilhelm, is that about right?</b>
</p>

<p>
That's absolutely correct. We got to choose an open source project to fight for
and I pitched Gentoo to my friends who gladly accepted.
