<b>The Gnome desktop is being updated to 2.12 for the more daring
Gentooists, reports this week's <uri 
link="/news/en/gwn/20051010-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri>, which also carries a detailed report and pictures 
from the London edition of the Linux World Expo.</b> The next monthly
Gentoo User Meeting (GUM) in Germany promises to be unusually exciting
with a system intrusion contest, and the Gentoo in the press section
found a video clip from a TV broadcast of a school's computer lab
running Gentoo. This and more, including of course the weekly 
statistics from the Gentoo bug report system, and several GLSAs are
on the menu this week. Have fun!
