<title>Gentoo Foundation Status Update</title>
<body>
<p>
Since its inception, the 
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo Foundation</uri>
existed as a legal entity in the State of New Mexico. It recently lapsed, 
however, since required paperwork and fees were not filed on time. The 
<uri link="http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/cgi-bin/prcdtl.cgi?2463313">online
filings</uri> do not indicate an exact date of termination.
</p>
<p>
The foundation trustees are evaluating all options open to them. This may 
include joining a consortium of software projects such as the 
<uri link="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom
Conservancy</uri> or <uri link="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public
Interest</uri> and having them handle our legal matters, renewing our status in
New Mexico, or other options. Former chief architect Daniel Robbins also 
offered to assist.
</p>
<p>
The legal status of the Gentoo Foundation has little short-term impact on the 
state of Gentoo Linux and further technical development and advancements.
</p>
<p>
The development community wants to find a solution to these legal problems, but
we are not going to quickly jump to conclusions without carefully evaluating 
the potential repercussions.  Anyone with questions about these matters is 
encouraged to <mail link="trustees@gentoo.org">email the trustees</mail>.
