<p>
<b>The Gentoo <uri link="/proj/en/releng">Release Engineering</uri> project is
pleased to announce the much-delayed release of Gentoo Linux 2007.0, code named
"Secret Sauce"</b>. This release met with several delays due to an abnormally
high number of security vulnerabilities in large packages which had to be
rebuilt using the newer, secure versions of the packages. There was also a
complete resnapshot done about half-way through the release period due to the
release taking so long and the packages becoming stale.
</p>

You can find out more information about the release in the <uri
