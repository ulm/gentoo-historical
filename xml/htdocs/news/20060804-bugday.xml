<p>
For the last three years, the Gentoo project has run monthly <uri link="http://bugday.gentoo.org">Bugday</uri>
events to encourage users and developers to team up and help to solve as many bugs as possible in a day. 
The first such event was held on Saturday August 2nd, 2003, and has continued on the first Saturday of
each month ever since, with members of both the user and developer communities meeting in #gentoo-bugs 
on the Freenode IRC network to work together on Gentoo's list of open bugs
</p>
<p>
Now, for the third anniversary of the initiative, the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/bugday/index.xml">Bugday team</uri> 
has something special planned. They have teamed up with sponsors including
<uri link="http://www.genesippc.com">Genesi</uri>, the <uri link="http://power.org">power.org</uri> 
community, and <uri link="http://www.thelinuxshop.co.uk">thelinuxshop.co.uk</uri> to bring a range of exciting prizes 
to those who can solve the most bugs in the day, as well as several quizzes with prizes going to the winners. The
star prize will be a real life Chilean Gentoo penguin, whose adoption for one year has been sponsored by one generous user. The winner will
not only be able to name the bird, but will receive regular updates and pictures charting its progress.
</p>
<p>
The Gentoo community sees Bugdays as a great way for people wanting to contribute to the project to get involved, 
as well as its obvious advantages in the number of bugs closed as a result of it, and this has been the case ever since the project 
began. The Bugday team believes that the atmosphere during Bugdays is very constructive and one which benefits the project 
as a whole: "We solve bugs together, enchance our packages - we call them ebuilds -, or parts of the documentation. 
The channel is unmoderated, so our users are encouraged to ask questions anytime to learn about Gentoo. 
Bugdays thus form an effective bridge between developers and users. And of course they help us solve more bugs. 
On a Bugday, the average number of closed bugs is around 280." says Bryan &#216;stergaard, Gentoo Developer and Bugday lead.
</p>
<p>
Anyone interested in Gentoo is of course always welcome to get involved with any bug in the tracker at http://bugs.gentoo.org, but there is a
suggested list of bugs of varying complexities that may be of interest on the Bugday page at http://bugday.gentoo.org/ as an introduction.
Gentoo Bugdays run all Saturday, midnight to midnight UTC, and this is no exception. Most of the contests will run for the entire day, so if
you are interested in taking part, you can do so at any time during the day. Good luck!
</p>
<p> 
The Gentoo Bugday team would of course like to extend their gratitude to our generous sponsors, without whom this event could not be
organised.
