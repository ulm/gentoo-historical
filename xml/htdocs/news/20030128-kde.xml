	<title>Gentoo Linux KDE 3.1 ebuilds</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>Dan Armak, our KDE developer writes:</b> 
"After a long, long wait, KDE 3.1 has finally been released. Ebuilds are
available in portage. emerge rsync and emerge kde to get it.
</p>
<p>
In Gentoo, KDE 3.1 lives side-by-side with KDE 3.0.x (and with KDE cvs from my cvs ebuilds). It will not replace your 3.0.x installation; you will be able to choose which one to start from the kdm/gdm/xdm session list. So remember to unmerge the old KDE 3.0.x if you want to reclaim diskspace after you make your transition.
</p>
<p>
The ebuilds have x86 and ppc stable keywords.

Enjoy KDE 3.1, and thanks to all the great KDE developers who've worked hard on this release!"
