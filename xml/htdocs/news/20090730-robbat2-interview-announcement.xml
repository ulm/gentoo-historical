<title>Robin H. Johnson (robbat2) speaks with David Abbott (dabbott)</title>
<body>
    
<p> 
Developer <mail link="robbat2"/>, who is a <uri
    link="/foundation/en/">trustee</uri> board member, <uri
    link="/proj/en/infrastructure/"> infrastructure team lead,</uri> spoke with
<mail link="dabbott"/>.  
</p>

<p> 
Robin is the backbone of the Gentoo infrastructure which includes the forums,
bugzilla, and most important the mother of it all, the Gentoo Portage tree.  
</p>

<p> 
He describes his first open source project, phpMyadmin, how he became a Gentoo
developer, and the layout of the infrastructure.  
</p>

<p> 
"Nearly 50 percent of the infrastructure hardware is taken up by web
applications, because we have a lot of separation between web applications that
have a high security exposure. Admittedly some of the web services are a very
big deal for Gentoo, like our Bugzilla service, running on 4 machines sponsored
by the Dutch social network, Hyves. Very recently we've gotten new hardware for
Forums, sponsored by Gossamer Threads. The next largest slice after that is the
machines that provides rsync.gentoo.org service. Only then do we get down to
individual machines for purposes. There's some cases where having more hardware
as fail-over in case we lose a machine would be nice, but I think the place
that'd we would benefit the most presently would be a newer mail server
infrastructure, so that we can deploy heavier spam filtering."
