	<title>Gentoo Weekly Newsletter -- January 20th, 2003</title>
<body>
<p><b>This week's <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030113-newsletter.xml">issue</uri> of the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter notes that the next release of
Gentoo Linux 1.4 will be rc3 instead of final.</b>  Additional news includes a presentation by one of the Gentoo Linux PPC developers at MIT along with an
introduction on how to get up and running with GnuPG.  Interested in contributing an article to the GWN?  Send an email to 
<mail link="gwn-feedback@gentoo.org">gwn-feedback@gentoo.org</mail> that summarizes your idea.  Topics can be about anything you want, as long as it is somehow
related to Gentoo Linux.  For selected submissions, we will contact the author and arrange for a full article to be written to appear in a future edition of
the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter.
