  <b>This issue of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml">Gentoo
      Weekly Newsletter</uri> contains the reason for an important change in the
    installation procedure: let stage3 be the default and remove stage1 and
    stage2 install instructions.</b> Again, we can offer you an interview, this
  time with Douglas Robertson, who uses Gentoo for video jukeboxes.  And last
  but not least we want to remind you about the Gentoo events in Germany this
  week.
