    The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/">Gentoo Foundation,
    Inc.</uri>, does, indeed, still exist. Foundation trustee <mail
    link="g2boojum">Grant Goodyear</mail> submitted an application Friday
    morning for reinstatement. This is a straightforward process that, once
    finished, means the foundation will be reinstated as if the revocation
    never happened. In addition, Grant filed documents to bring the foundation
    up to date with New Mexico's nonprofit corporation
    requirements. Foundation trustees originally filed the required paperwork
    in summer of 2007, but apparently it was misplaced. For more information
    or to see how you might help, see <uri
