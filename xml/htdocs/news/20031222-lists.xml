<p>
The server that runs our mailing lists is having some technical difficulties and is down as a result.  We are working with the sponsor to restore service as soon as possible.  In the mean time, users are encouraged to use IRC or the <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/">Gentoo user forums</uri> for user support needs.</p>
