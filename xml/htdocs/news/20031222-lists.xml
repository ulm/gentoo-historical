	<title>Mailing List downtime</title>
<body>
<p>
The server that runs our mailing lists is having some technical difficulties and is down as a result.  We are working with the sponsor to restore service as soon as possible.  In the mean time, users are encouraged to use IRC or the <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/">Gentoo user forums</uri> for user support needs.</p>
<p>
<b>Update:</b> Over the weekend Gentoo's list server suffered network problems, in order to preserve the current emails and the list emails we queued them in hopes to get the problem fixed. We restored the mail lists from a backup today and recovered what we had; however, last Thursday and Friday's subscribers are gone. For those that signed up, please resign up again.</p>
