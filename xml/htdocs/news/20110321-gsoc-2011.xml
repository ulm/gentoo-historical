<title>Students, get paid to work on Gentoo this summer!</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo has been accepted for its 6th consecutive year in the Google 
Summer of Code! GSoC pays college students $5000 to work full-time on an 
open-source project for a summer. Check out our <uri 
link="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2011/gentoo"> GSoC 
2011 homepage</uri> if you are interested in this year's GSoC for 
Gentoo. We particularly encourage applications from students who are 
new to Gentoo development&mdash;many of our students become 
Gentoo developers after a successful summer.
