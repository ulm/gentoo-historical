<title>Gentoo/PPC to officially support Genesi's Open Desktop Workstation</title>

<body>

<p>
Putting the finishing touches on the hard work of several months, the Gentoo/PPC 
team led by <mail link="pvdabeel@gentoo.org">Pieter van den Abeele</mail>, and 
PegasosPPC manufacturer and Gentoo sponsor <uri link="http://www.genesi.lu">
Genesi</uri> have announced <b>official Gentoo/PPC support of Genesi's Open Desktop 
Workstation</b> family of hardware products. Moreover, Genesi will start selling 
systems with Gentoo Linux on them, and donate a portion of the profits to the Gentoo 
Foundation, as soon as the few remaining technical questions are solved this week.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo Foundation is very happy about this step towards an even closer partnership 
with Genesi, and proud of the Gentoo/PPC developers' team effort to support the ODW 
platform! In-depth coverage of the agreement, the sales, and more information will be 
published in the next issue of the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter.
