<b>The results from the first Gentoo User Survey are published, reports the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20041108-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</uri></b>. Italian Gentoo users and developers are getting ready for their big "G-Day" event on 27 November. Other news include digests from the Gentoo user and developer mailing lists, a clever tip for those wanting a leaner system, and the "Gentoo in the press" section made a peculiar catch this week. Four new developers have joined the Gentoo team, one, sadly, has left, both announcements are also in this week's GWN.
