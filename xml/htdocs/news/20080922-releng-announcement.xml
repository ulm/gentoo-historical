  <title>New release strategy to provide more current install media</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      In future releases, <b>Gentoo will focus on a more
      back-to-basics approach</b> that will give you up-to-date
      install media on a regular basis and make much better use of our
      human resources. <b>We're looking into automated weekly
      builds</b> of the minimal CDs and stage tarballs as well as
      maybe an annual LiveCD release. We will keep you updated as we
      decide on the details of this new approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, <b>we're canceling the 2008.1 release</b>. The
      release engineering team has to reconsider its
      priorities&mdash;we overstretched our human resources during the
      prolonged 2008.0 release process. This caused too much stress
      for our release engineers and multiple postponements of the
      release.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>You can help!</b> The release engineering team is looking for
      new volunteers because it perpetually has a severe lack of
      manpower. We are particularly looking for people with a good
      grasp of ebuild development and the ability to debug/fix
      problems that crop up during building and testing of the stage
      tarballs and ISO images. We will update the staffing needs page
      with more details.
