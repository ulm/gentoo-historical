<title>OpenRC and baselayout 2 will be stabilized on May 8</title>

<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://roy.marples.name/openrc">OpenRC</uri>, the replacement for
Gentoo's current services system (known as baselayout), will be stabilized
on May 8. It replaces the previous bash-only rc system in baselayout
with an rc system that has a C-based core and uses only POSIX-compliant shell
code.
</p>

<p>
You will see an update for sys-apps/baselayout to 2.x and a new package,
sys-apps/openrc. It is recommended that you perform this update as soon as
possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>After these packages are emerged, it is absolutely critical that you
immediately update your configuration files with <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=3&amp;chap=4">dispatch-conf,
etc-update</uri> or a similar tool then follow the steps in the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openrc-migration.xml">OpenRC Migration
Guide</uri></b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Failure to follow all of these steps will result in an unbootable
system.</b> If that happens, you will need to boot from a LiveCD or LiveDVD,
mount your root filesystem, <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&amp;chap=6#doc_chap1">chroot
into that environment</uri> and follow the above steps.
