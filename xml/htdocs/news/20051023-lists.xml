<title>Mailing List Server issues</title>

<body>

<p>
    We are currently experiencing some problems with the network connection at the University of Trieste where our mailing list server is at. We are working on trying to regain connectivity, but it looks like it may be down for several hours. We are sorry about the downtime and hope to have lists back as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
    <b>UPDATE:</b> We've regained the network connection for our mailing list server and postings should be back to normal. Please file a bug and assign it to infra-bugs if you have any other issues with our mailing lists. Thank you!
