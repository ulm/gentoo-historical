<title>OpenRC and baselayout 2 will reach ~arch soon</title>

<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://roy.marples.name/openrc">OpenRC</uri>, the replacement for
Gentoo's current services system (known as baselayout), will soon reach ~arch
on all platforms. It replaces the previous bash-only rc system in baselayout
with an rc system that has a C-based core and uses only POSIX-compliant shell
code.
</p>

<p>
OpenRC runs natively on a wide variety of systems. Out of the box, it's
compatible with Gentoo Linux, Gentoo/FreeBSD, Embedded Gentoo, and Gentoo
VServers. It also works with FreeBSD and NetBSD and can be found in their
package repositories, ports and pkgsrc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Before upgrading, read the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openrc-migration.xml">OpenRC Migration
Guide</uri></b> so you update your system properly once OpenRC and baselayout
2 are installed.
