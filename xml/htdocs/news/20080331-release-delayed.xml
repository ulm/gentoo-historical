  <title>2008.0 beta still in progress</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      The 2008.0 beta is roughly a month behind the original <uri
      link="/news/20080123_releng_beta.xml">tentative
      schedule</uri>. A number of factors contributed to this,
      including the migration to <uri
      link="/proj/en/releng/meetings/20080123_initial_2008.0_summary.txt">new
      release processes</uri>, the usual delays that affect most
      open-source projects, and the <uri
      link="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_2a1ce23e70f898c5e7a5de96738013be.xml">death
      of a close relative</uri> of our developers Chris Gianelloni and
      Chrissy Fullam.
    </p>

    <p>
      Work on the first beta is still underway, and we expect to
      release it soon.
