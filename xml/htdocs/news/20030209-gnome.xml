<b>Marinus Schraal, one of our GNOME developers writes:</b> 
"Just five months after the 2.0 release the GNOME team brings you GNOME 2.2.
Besides overall stability and speed improvements, it also includes a lot of new features such as
recent files functionality, startup notification, a notification area
applet and much more. For a comprehensive list, see the 
<uri link="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.2/notes/">release notes</uri>
</p>
<p>
Currently it is marked stable for x86, other arches will follow soon. Based
on the information in <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15194">this
bug</uri>, we recommend not building GNOME 2.2 with a locale set of *UTF-8 locale set."
