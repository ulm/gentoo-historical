  <title>2008.0_beta1 unleashed. No joke.</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      When we said "<uri
      link="/news/20080331-release-delayed.xml">soon</uri>," even we didn't
      realize how soon it would be. <b>2008.0_beta1 is here.</b> Your support
      and enthusiasm are greatly appreciated&mdash;<b>thank you</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>You can help</b> make 2008.0 amazing! Test out this beta and <uri
      link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">report any functionality issues</uri>
      you encounter. Since this is the first beta, we're looking only for bugs
      in functionality, not bugs in appearance such as desktop backgrounds or
      other artwork. <b>We expect to release a second beta</b> once your
      testing has helped us fix problems with this first beta.
    </p>

    <p>
      A migration to RPM was <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030401-newsletter.xml#doc_chap1">carefully
      considered</uri> <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030407-newsletter.xml#doc_chap1_sect2">again</uri>
      for this release, but in the end we decided to wait for the few
      remaining RPM-using distributions to migrate to the superior packaging
      format of ebuilds.
