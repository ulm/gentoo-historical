<b>Announcing the migration of the Forums to new hard- and software, among 
other things, the  <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20050214-newsletter.xml">Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter</uri> presents an interview with Thierry Carrez, Operational Co-Lead
of the Gentoo Linux Security Team, and has an overview of upcoming events 
including the Linux World Expo opening on Tuesday in Boston. </b> The Future 
Zone has an interesting outlook on Open-Xchange in Gentoo Linux, the press clipping
section is particularly well filled this week, and the International section has
an article on the last Gentoo Bugday and how it was celebrated at Oregon State
University, and covers a German company that has just released their storage
management tool for Gentoo Linux. Today's edition also carries some advanced
Portage magic in the tips &amp; tricks section, and of course the usual 
security news and Bugzilla statistics.
