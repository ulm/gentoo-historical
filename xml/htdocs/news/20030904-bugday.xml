	<title>Second Gentoo BugDay to be held on September 6</title>
<body>
<p><b>
Since last month's Gentoo BugDay was such a success, we're going to have another one next Saturday, on September 6, and on the first Saturday of each month from now on.</b> Come on down to the <b>#gentoo-bugs</b> channel on irc.freenode.net, and help us squash bugs and maintain the high quality of our distribution - it's also a great opportunity for devs and users to get to know each other.
