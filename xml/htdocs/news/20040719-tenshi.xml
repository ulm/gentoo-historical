	<title>Tenshi 0.3</title>
<body>
<p>
We are pleased to announce that tenshi 0.3 has been released with a lot of major
improvements.
</p>
<p>
Tenshi was formerly known as wasabi. The name was changed to tenshi after we were
informed that wasabi is a registered trademark relating to another piece of software.
</p>
<p>
Tenshi is a log monitoring program, designed to watch one or more log files for
lines matching user defined regular expressions and report on the matches. The regular
expressions are assigned to queues which have an alert interval and a list of
mail recipients.
</p>
<p>
Queues can be set to send a notification as soon as there is a log line assigned                                                             to it, or to send periodic reports.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, uninteresting fields in the log messages (such as PID numbers) can
be masked with the standard regular expressions grouping operators ( ). This
allows cleaner and more readable reports. All reports are separated by hostname
and all messages are condensed when possible.
</p>
<p>
This is a Gentoo hosted project initially developed for Gentoo infrastructure
servers.
