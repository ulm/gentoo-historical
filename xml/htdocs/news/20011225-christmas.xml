	<title>Christmas Gentoo Linux Update</title>
	<body>
		
<p><b>There's been a tremendous amount of work going into Gentoo Linux in the past few months, and
Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6 has become, well, pretty amazing.</b>  Very refined, and lots of new capabilities and
fixes have been added.  Here is an incomplete list:  New <b>2.4.16</b> kernel with ACPI, <b>XFS</b>, LVM, low
latency and preemptive kernel patches, a <b>new binutils</b> to fix Athlon and PIII-specific instruction
compilation problems -- resulting in rock-solid kernels even when configured for higher-end CPU
types, a new Portage release that allows you to <b>safely upgrade glibc even while you're in X</b> without
causing any applications to segfault or otherwise mess up, a <b>completely reworked and improved
install CD</b> that supports installation to LVM, software RAID, ext2, ext3, ReiserFS and XFS filesystems,
and much more.  Oh, our new glibc includes <b>a fix for the recent glibc "glob" security hole</b>.  And, of
course, the <b>latest NVIDIA drivers</b> and a very fast and stable platform to run them on, not to mention
around 1100 ports-based packages in total, and still counting.</p>
