	<title>Gentoo/MacOS X announced</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>We're pleased to announce that the Gentoo platform will soon be available
for MacOS X.
</b> This means that users will be able to enjoy the
the power and simplicity of the Gentoo platform and Portage where they happen to be, on the
operating system they are currently using -- even if that operating system
isn't GNU/Linux. We want to give our users more choices than anyone else,
including the ability to
use non-GNU operating systems and non-Linux kernels if they have that
particular requirement or desire.</p>
<p>
We are currently getting our infrastructure ready (mailing lists, project
page, etc.) for
this project and integrating Portage for MacOS X into our mainline Portage
sources. I'll follow up with another news item when this initial process is complete.
