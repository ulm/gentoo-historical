  <title>First sets of weekly stage3 and minimal CDs released</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      The time has come! Our release engineers have been refining their
      automated builds of the minimal CD and stage3 tarballs, and the first
      builds are uploaded to our mirrors. Select your
      favorite <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml">mirror</uri>
      and navigate to the /experimental/ directory. Under the x86, amd64,
      ia64, alpha, and sparc64 architectures, the autobuild directory contains
      stages. So far, minimal CD isos are only available for x86 and amd64.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're still working to add automated builds for ppc, ppc64 and hppa as
      well as CD images for architectures lacking them. We built the stage3
      tarballs from the latest stable packages. Fresh builds will show up
      every week, although sometimes we might skip a week if build problems
      crop up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because these builds are automated, they have not been
      rigorously tested as the old releases. Occasionally, you might
      run into problems. If that happens, just try a file from a
      different week.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please try out these new builds and leave your feedback on the
      forums.

      Happy holidays!
