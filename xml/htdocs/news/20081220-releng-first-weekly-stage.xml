  <title>First sets of weekly stage3 and minimal CDs released</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      The time has come! Our release engineers have been refining their
      automated builds of the minimal CD and stage3 tarballs, and the first
      builds are uploaded to our mirrors. <b>Select your favorite <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml">mirror</uri> and
      navigate to the /experimental/ directory.</b> Under the x86, amd64,
      ia64, alpha, and sparc64 architectures, the autobuild directory contains
      stages. So far, minimal CD images are only available for x86 and amd64.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're still working to add automated builds for ppc, ppc64 and hppa as
      well as CD images for architectures lacking them. <b>We built the stage3
      tarballs from the latest stable packages.</b> Fresh builds will show up
      every week, although sometimes we might skip a week if build problems
      crop up.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Because these builds are automated, they have not been rigorously
      tested as the old releases.</b> Occasionally, you might run into
      problems. If that happens, just try a file from a different week.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please try out these new builds and leave your feedback on the
      forums.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Happy holidays!</b>
