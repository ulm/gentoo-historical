<p><b>Be sure to check out the new <uri link="/main/en/graphics.xml">Graphics
section</uri> and our new "Powered by Gentoo Linux" logo.</b>  Developers will
also be interested in Grant Goodyear's new <uri link="/doc/en/uml.xml">User-Mode
Linux Guide</uri>.  Like <uri link="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</uri>,
User-Mode Linux will allow you to run a virtual Linux system on your PC.  But
unlike VMWare, User-Mode Linux is free :)  Also, <uri
link="http://freshmeat.net/releases/71626/">a new version 1.9 of keychain</uri>
(a <c>ssh-agent</c> manager) has been released.  Enjoy!  Work on Gentoo Linux
1.0 continues to go well. <b>Oh -- almost forgot!  Check out our updated <uri
link="/main/en/about.xml">About Gentoo Linux section</uri>, now featuring our groovy
cow poster that made its debut at this year's FOSDEM.  The page has also been updated
to reflect the forthcoming Gentoo Linux 1.0 release.</b> </p>
