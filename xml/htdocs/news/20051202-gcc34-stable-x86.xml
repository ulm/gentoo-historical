	<title>GCC 3.4 marked stable on x86</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>GCC 3.4 has finally been marked stable on x86.</b>  No one will have their
compiler automatically switched to gcc-3.4 after it is installed, so you can
handle the migration to using it as your system compiler when you have time.
To assist you in the migration we have made a <uri
link="/doc/en/gcc-upgrading.xml"> GCC migration guide</uri>.
</p>

<p>
For support issues, #gentoo is the place to receive help. Bugs found in the
course of this upgrade should be filed under the "Gentoo Linux" product, and
"GCC Porting" component on <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo's
Bugzilla</uri>.
