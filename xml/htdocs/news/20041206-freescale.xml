<title>2004 Freescale Linux Developer Survey</title>

<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://www.freescale.com/">Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.</uri> is conducting a <uri link="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=DRPPCLINUXSURHM">2004 Linux Developer Survey</uri> asking questions of those folks who develop Linux, or applications and utilities that run on Linux.  The survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete and features Gentoo Linux as an option in the "What distribution of Linux are you using as your primary platform?" question.  Freescale has been very supportive of the Gentoo Linux project, recently donating 13 machines to further development of Gentoo on the PPC platform.  We encourage any qualified developer to take a few minutes and respond to the survey.
