    If you want to see if your package is included we have generated both the

      list</uri>, and <uri
      link="/proj/en/pr/releases/12.1/AMD64_package_list.txt">amd64 package
      list</uri>. You may also be interested in checking out the <uri

      <li>
        Writable file systems using AUFS so you can emerge new packages!

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The LiveDVD is <b>available in two flavors</b>: a hybrid x86/x86_64 version, and
an x86_64 multi lib version. The <path>livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-12.1</path> version
will work on 32-bit x86 or 64-bit x86_64. If your CPU architecture is x86, then
boot with the default <c>gentoo</c> kernel. If your arch is <uri
link="/doc/en/gentoo-amd64-faq.xml#difference">amd64</uri>, boot with the
<c>gentoo64</c> kernel. This means you can boot a 64-bit kernel and install a
customized 64-bit user land while using the provided 32-bit user land. The
<path>livedvd-amd64-multilib-12.1</path> version is for x86_64 only.
