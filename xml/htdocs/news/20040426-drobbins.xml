	<title>Daniel Robbins, Gentoo Linux Chief Architect, announces retirement</title>
<body>
<p>
	<b>Gentoo Linux's Chief Architect,
		Daniel Robbins, announced today that he is resigning from his 
		development responsibilities for Gentoo.</b>  
	Drobbins will be staying with Gentoo until the not-for-profit (NFP)
	organization is established, at which point the newly-chosen NFP board of
	directors will take over governance.  We are extremely sad to see Daniel Robbins
	depart, and we both wish him the best in his new endeavors and
	promise that the door will always be open for his return.
