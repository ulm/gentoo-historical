<b>Great week for MIPS users: a new LiveCD for SGI and stages for Cobalt servers
open this issue of the <uri link="/news/en/gwn/20051024-newsletter.xml">Gentoo 
Weekly Newsletter</uri>. The officially release Openoffice finds its fans among
Gentooists, and a short trick tells you what to do in case packages need 
rebuilding after a kernel upgrade. Also in this edition: Gentoo in the press, 
lots of security announcements, and the bugzilla statistics. Have fun reading
this week's GWN!
