<p>
The Gentoo release team is working hard to get Gentoo Linux 2004.0 to 
the mirrors as quickly as possible, but we are experiencing some 
technical problems with our mirroring system that are hindering the 
process. This should be resolved within the next 24 to 48 hours. Thank 
you for your patience.
