<p>
Early in the morning of September 16th, Rob Levin passed away in the neuro
trauma intensive care unit of a Houston hospital after being struck by a car
whilst out riding his bicycle.  During his long career fostering collaboration
within the open source community, Rob did much good work; he is most known for
being the driving force behind the <uri link="http://freenode.net">freenode IRC
network</uri>, where many large and popular projects coordinate development
activities. Rob was a friend of Gentoo and was always helpful when approached.

<p>
We would like to extend our condolences to the family of Mr. Levin, to the
freenode staffers, and to PDPC board members.  Rest in peace.
