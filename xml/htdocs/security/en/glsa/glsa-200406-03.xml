    sitecopy easily maintains remote websites. It makes it simple to keep a
    remote site synchronized with the local site with one command.

    <p>
    Multiple format string vulnerabilities and a heap overflow vulnerability
    were discovered in the code of the neon library (GLSA 200405-01 and
    200405-13). Current versions of the sitecopy package include their own
    version of this library.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    When connected to a malicious WebDAV server, these vulnerabilities could
    allow execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
    sitecopy.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Currently, there is no released version of sitecopy that contains a fix for
    this issue. The original author of the program has indicated he is unsure
    when a fixed version may be released. Therefore, the sitecopy package has
    been hard-masked and current users are advised to unmerge the package until
    a new version is available.
