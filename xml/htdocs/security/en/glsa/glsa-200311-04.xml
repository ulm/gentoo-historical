<summary>FreeRADIUS heap exploit and NULL pointer derefence exploits</summary>
<description>FreeRADIUS versions below 0.9.3 are vulnerable to a heap exploit, however, the attack code must be in the form of a valid RADIUS packet which limits the possible exploits.

Also corrected in the 0.9.3 release is another vulnerability which causes the RADIUS server to de-reference a NULL pointer and crash when an Access-Request packet with a Tunnel-Password is received.

Please see the announcement at: http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2003/Nov/1008263.html for more details regarding the issue.</description>
