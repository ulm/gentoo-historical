    Quote from http://www.time-travellers.org/oftpd/
    </p>
    <p>
    &quot;oftpd is designed to be as secure as an anonymous FTP server can
    possibly be. It runs as non-root for most of the time, and uses the Unix
    chroot() command to hide most of the systems directories from external
    users - they cannot change into them even if the server is totally
    compromised! It contains its own directory change code, so that it can run
    efficiently as a threaded server, and its own directory listing code (most
    FTP servers execute the system &quot;ls&quot; command to list files).&quot;

    <p>
    Issuing a port command with a number higher than 255 causes the server to
    crash.  The port command may be issued before any authentication takes
    place, meaning the attacker does not need to know a valid username and
    password in order to exploit this vulnerability.
