<description>
	<p>There is a remotely exploitable bug in xchat 2.0.6 that could lead to a denial of service attack.  This is caused by sending a malformed DCC packet to xchat 2.0.6, causing it to crash. Versions prior to 2.0.6 do not appear to be affected by this bug.</p>
	<p>For more information, please see <uri link="http://mail.nl.linux.org/xchat-announce/2003-12/msg00000.html">mail.nl.linux.org/xchat-announce/2003-12/msg00000.html</uri></p> 
	<p>Gentoo wishes to thank lloydbates for discovering this bug, as well as jcdutton and rac for submitting patches to fix the bug.</p>

	<p>
	For Gentoo users, xchat-2.0.6 was marked ~arch (unstable) for most architectures. Since it was never marked as stable in the portage tree, only xchat users who have explictly added the unstable keyword to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS are affected. Users may updated affected machines to the patched version of xchat using the following commands:
	<pre>
        emerge sync                                                                                                                                                                                             
        emerge -pv '&gt;=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
        emerge '&gt;=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
        emerge clean
	</pre>
	This assumes that users are running with ACCEPT_KEYWORDS enabled for their architecture.
