<description>
	<p>There is a remotely exploitable bug in xchat-2.0.6 that could lead to a denial of service attack.  This is caused by sending a malformed DCC packet to xchat 2.0.6, causing it to crash.</p>

<solution>
<description>
	<p>For Gentoo users, xchat 2.0.6 was never marked as stable in the portage tree, so users are only affected if they were running with ACCEPT_KEYWORDS enabled on their machine.  Users who are affected may upgrade to the patched version of xchat using the following method:
	<pre>
        emerge sync                                                                                                                                                                                             
        emerge -pv '&gt;&=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
        emerge '>=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
        emerge clean
	</pre>
	This assumes that users are running with ACCEPT_KEYWORDS enabled for their architecture.
