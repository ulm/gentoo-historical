  <affected>
    <package name="net-nds/openldap" auto="yes" arch="*">

    <p>
    OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP-related application and development tools. It
    includes slapd (the standalone LDAP server), slurpd (the standalone LDAP
    replication server), and various LDAP libraries, utilities and example
    clients.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    A password extended operation (password EXOP) which fails will cause the
    slapd server to free() an uninitialized pointer, possibly resulting in a
    segfault. This only affects servers using the back-ldbm backend.
    </p>
    <p>
    Such a crash is not guaranteed with every failed operation, however, it is
    possible.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker (or indeed, a normal user) may crash the OpenLDAP server,
    creating a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue.  All users are
    advised to upgrade to the latest version of OpenLDAP.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    OpenLDAP users should upgrade to version 2.1.17 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-nds/openldap-2.1.17"
    # emerge ">=net-nds/openldap-2.1.17"</code>
