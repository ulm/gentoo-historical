	<summary>Security problems in Ethereal 0.9.15</summary>
<description>
Quote from &lt;http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00011.html&gt;:

  Potential security issues have been discovered in the following protocol
  dissectors:

    * An improperly formatted GTP MSISDN string could cause a buffer
      overflow.

    * A malformed ISAKMP or MEGACO packet could make Ethereal or
      Tethereal crash.

    * The SOCKS dissector was susceptible to a heap overlfow.

  Impact:

    It may be possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code
    by injecting a purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, or
    by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

  Resolution:

     Upgrade to 0.9.16.
	
     If you are running a version prior to 0.9.16 and you cannot
     upgrade, you can disable the GTP, ISAKMP, MEGACO, and SOCKS
     protocol dissectors by selecting Edit->Protocols... and
     deselecting them from the list.

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-analyzer/ethereal 0.9.x upgrade:

emerge sync
emerge '&gt;=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.9.16'
emerge clean
