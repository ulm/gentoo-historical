<summary>KDM vulnerabilities</summary>
<description>Firstly, versions of KDM &lt;= 3.1.3 are vulnerable to a privilege escalation bug with a specific configuration of PAM modules. Users who do not use PAM with KDM and users who use PAM with regular Unix crypt/MD5 based authentication methods are not affected.

Secondly, KDM uses a weak cookie generation algorithm. It is advised that users upgrade to KDE 3.1.4, which uses /dev/urandom as a non-predictable source of entropy to improve security.

Please look at http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030916-1.txt for the KDE Security Advisory and source patch locations for older versions of KDE.</description>
<solution>
<description>Users are encouraged to perform an 'emerge --sync' and upgrade the package to the latest available version. KDE 3.1.4 is recommended and should be marked stable for most architectures. Specific steps to upgrade:

emerge --sync
emerge '>=kde-base/kde-3.1.4'
emerge clean
