    <p>
    Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple flaws in the Scorched 3D game
    server, including a format string vulnerability and several buffer
    overflows.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to crash a
    game server or execute arbitrary code with the rights of the game
    server user. Users not running a Scorched 3D game server are not
    affected by these flaws.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    The Scorched 3D package has been hard-masked until a new version
    correcting these flaws is released. In the meantime, current users are
    advised to unmerge the package:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge games-strategy/scorched3d</code>
  </resolution>
