    <p>
    From http://www.clamav.net/ :
    </p>
    <p>
    &quot;Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main
    purpose of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
    scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
    daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
    Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with the
    Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software. Most
    importantly, the virus database is kept up to date.&quot;
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    Certain types of RAR archives, including those created by variants of the
    W32.Beagle.A@mm worm, may cause clamav to crash when it attempts to process
    them.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    This vulnerability causes a Denial of Service in the clamav process.  Depending on 
    configuration, this may cause dependent services such as mail to fail as well.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised
    to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    ClamAV users should upgrade to version 0.68.1 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/clamav-0.68.1"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/clamav-0.68.1"</code>
