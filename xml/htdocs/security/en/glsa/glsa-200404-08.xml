    Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in' files which
    is often used in conjuction with Autoconf and other GNU Autotools to ease
    portability among applications. It also provides a standardized and light
    way of writing complex Makefiles through the use of many built-in macros.

  <description>
    <p>
    Automake may be vulnerable to a symbolic link attack which may allow an
    attacker to modify data or escalate their privileges. This is due to the
    insecure way Automake creates directories during compilation. An attacker
    may be able to create symbolic links in the place of files contained in the
    affected directories, which may potentially lead to elevated privileges due
    to modification of data.

    unauthorized fashion or elevate their privileges.

  <resolution>
    <p>
    Automake users should upgrade to version 1.8.3 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=sys-devel/automake-1.8.3"
