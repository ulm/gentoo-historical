<title>Prerequisites</title>
<section>
<title>Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
A certain number of accounts must be established before working as a GLSA
coordinator. To draft GLSAs you must get a
<uri link="https://dev.gentoo.org/glsamaker/">GLSAMaker</uri> account. To
manage security bugs you need to have a
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Bugzilla</uri> account, which will be
upgraded to <c>editbugs</c> privileges. To send GLSA announcements you
need to have a yourname@gentoo.org address (i.e. to be a Gentoo developer).
This address should be allowed to send to gentoo-announce.
To commit XML GLSAs you need your developer account to be upgraded with
commit access to the GLSA directory in the <c>gentoo</c> CVS repository.
Finally you need an IRC name. You will be required to hang out in the
#gentoo-security channel whenever you're available online.
</p>

<note>
All the names used should be consistent in order to allow easy identification.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>GPG key</title>
<body>

<p>
You must create a GPG key for your yourname@gentoo.org email address. You
can either create a specific key or add the gentoo.org address to an
existing key. The key ID should be sent to devrel, and you should check
that your name and key ID appears on the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml">developer
list</uri>. It is very important that the key is published at least on
the <uri link="http://subkeys.pgp.net:11371">subkeys.pgp.net</uri> keyserver.
It can also be submitted on other keyservers.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Environment</title>
<body>

<p>
You must setup a CVS environment on your home machine to be able to commit
your GLSAs to the tree. 
This is done by checking out a part of the <c>gentoo</c> CVS repository to a
given directory (for example ~/gentoo_cvs):
</p>

<pre caption="Setup CVS environment">
you@home you $ <i>mkdir gentoo_cvs</i>
you@home you $ <i>cd gentoo_cvs</i>
you@home gentoo_cvs $ <i>export CVS_RSH="ssh"</i>
you@home gentoo_cvs $ <i>export CVSROOT="yourname@cvs.gentoo.org:/var/cvsroot"</i>
you@home gentoo_cvs $ <i>cvs checkout gentoo/xml/htdocs/security</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Mailing-list subscriptions</title>
<body>

<p>
To be able to post to the lists where we publish our GLSAs, you must
subscribe your yourname@gentoo.org address to them:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>List</th>
    <th>Subscription page</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <ti>bugtraq@securityfocus.com</ti>
     <ti><uri>http://www.securityfocus.com/subscribe</uri></ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <ti>full-disclosure@lists.grok.org.uk</ti>
     <ti><uri>https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure</uri></ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<note>
You can subscribe to a digest version of Full-Disclosure.
</note>

<p>
As a security developer, you will be added to the gentoo-core list and
security@gentoo.org alias. You should also subscribe to gentoo-announce,
gentoo-dev and gentoo-security.

<title>Security bug types and Bugzilla components</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
All security bugs are located in the <c>Gentoo Security</c> Bugzilla product.
If you find a security bug which does not have the correct product name,
please fix it immediately. There are several different types of security bugs,
and each has its own component.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Vulnerability</title>
<body>

<p>
Vulnerabilities are security bugs in the upstream software or introduced in
the Gentoo ebuild packaging. These bugs result in GLSAs. Kernel bugs have
their own category and should not filed as <c>Vulnerability</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Kernel</title>
<body>

<p>
Kernel vulnerabilities are treated using a separate procedure. To easily
distinguish them from the other bugs, they are filed under the <c>Kernel</c>
category. Kernel bugs do not result in GLSAs but have their own publication
system (Gentoo KISS).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Default config</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo packages should be as secure by default as possible. Default
configuration bugs are filed when the default configuration shipped with the
package can be improved in terms of security. <c>Default config</c> bugs do
not generate GLSAs.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Auditing</title>
<body>

<p>
Vulnerabilities that are found by Gentoo developers should be double-checked
before going out in the open (to upstream developers or security lists). They
are filed as Confidential Bugs (see below) and with the <c>Auditing</c>
component. When the finding has been verified they are switched to
<c>Vulnerability</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Restricted bugs</title>
<body>

<p>
Sometimes a bug is communicated to us under the promise we'll keep it secret
until a public release. Restricted bugs have the "Gentoo Security" checkbox
checked and therefore can only be accessed by Gentoo Security Team members.
External people (package maintainer, arch testers, Release Engineering) may be
added on a per-name basis, aliases should never be used (because they are too
wide and won't allow bug comments).  
</p>

<p>
There are three different types of restricted bugs. The first (and most secret)
ones are the <c>CLASSIFIED</c> bugs. A bug is classified when it contains
information that should never be released. This includes quotes of personal
emails sent to restricted mailing-lists or non-public intermediary patches.
Classified bugs are identified by the <c>CLASSIFIED</c> keyword in their Status
Whiteboard. Once CLASSIFIED, a bug cannot go back to unclassified status unless
at least two security managers agree to declassify it.
<c>CLASSIFIED</c> bugs should never be opened (unrestricted).
</p>

<p>
The second type of restricted bugs is <c>CONFIDENTIAL</c> bugs. These are bugs
that contain information that should be kept secret until an agreed-upon
coordinated release date. No part of the bug (affected package name,
description, proposed patch or whatever) should ever leak outside the bug.
Patches should NOT be committed to portage CVS.
</p>

<p>
The third (and less secret) type of restricted bugs is the <c>SEMI-PUBLIC</c>
bugs. Semi-public bugs should be kept secret, but patches may be committed to
portage. This is generally when the vulnerability is not known to the general
public but could be accessed by anyone (patch in upstream CVS for example).
</p>

<title>Status whiteboard rules</title>
<body>

<p>
The status whiteboard in Bugzilla lets us keep track of the security bug
resolution steps. It should be following this pattern: "RATING [status]
coordinator", where:
</p>

<section>
<title>Determining original bug status</title>
<body>

<p>
When the fix is not available from the upstream developer and/or there is
no official patch to solve the problem, the bug is in [upstream] status. If
the solution must be found amongst Gentoo developers, the bug is in [inhouse]
status. If a fix is available, the bug is in [ebuild] status.
If a fix ebuild is put
in the portage tree, the bug is in [stable] status. When the fix ebuild is
in portage with all required keywords set, the bug is in [glsa] status.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Bugs in [upstream] status</title>
<body>

<p>
In [upstream] status, we wait for the fix version or a decent patch to
appear. This status requires to regularly check upstream for information:
development and announce mailing lists, websites, Bugs database, CVS when
available, are all relevant sources of information. Unofficial patches must
be taken into account only if the upstream developer does not react to the
vulnerability, and they must be thoroughly double-checked to ensure they
are not evil. When a fix version is announced or a patch is found, the bug
enters [ebuild] status.
</p>

<p>
If there is no reaction from upstream and no patch, we enter [upstream+]
status. The only option here is to security-mask the vulnerable package
and issue a temporary GLSA if needed. See the policy for more details on the
security masking approval procedure. The status whiteboard should then be
flagged with masked and/or tempglsa keywords and bug severity set to
<c>enhancement</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Bugs in [ebuild] status</title>
<body>

<p>
In [ebuild] status, we must identify the maintainer of the package, and
summon him to commit a fix ebuild. Sources to identify the herd or developer
responsible for maintaining a package are the metadata.xml file in the
directory of the package in portage and the Changelog file showing who did the
latest version bumps. You should Cc: the herd and/or maintainer responsible
for the package on the bug and ask him to provide an ebuild for the fix
version. You should periodically check that an ebuild wasn't committed
to portage without any comment on the bug (it happens). When the ebuild
appears, the bug enters [stable] status.
</p>

<p>
If the maintainer doesn't show up, we enter [ebuild+] status. In cases of fix
version, you should test if a simple version bump (renaming the ebuild to the
latest version and emerging it) works. In cases of patch, you should test if
it applies cleanly. Then you should find a security bug wrangler with x86
commit rights to do the bump and mark the ebuild ~ for testing.
</p>

<p>
If the bump is not easy and/or any problem is detected with the bumped ebuild,
the only option is to security-mask the unmaintained package and issue a
temporary GLSA if needed. See the policy for more details on the
security masking approval procedure. The status whiteboard should then be
flagged with masked and/or tempglsa keywords and bug severity set to
<c>enhancement</c>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Bugs in [stable] status</title>
<body>

<p>
In [stable] status, you have to determine what KEYWORDS the provided ebuild
needs before the GLSA can go out. This can be tricky. You have to consider
every version currently in portage so that the fix ebuild has <e>equally or
more stable</e> keywords than any other packages in portage. Here is an
example:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Versions</th>
<th>Keywords</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Affected</ti>
<ti>x86 ~ppc ~ia64</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Affected</ti>
<ti>x86 ppc</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Affected</ti>
<ti>~x86 ~ppc ~ia64</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Fix must have:</ti>
<th>x86 ppc ~ia64</th>
</tr>
</table>

<note>
You can use <uri>http://packages.gentoo.org</uri> to help you determine
the needed KEYWORDS. If affected packages were removed by the package
maintainer too early, you should use the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/">CVS access</uri>
to dig in the Attic and look for old KEYWORDS.
</note>

<p>
Once determined (and noted for reference on the bug) the needed KEYWORDS,
you should Cc: arch teams and ask them to mark the ebuild stable or ~
accordingly. The arches alias are archname@gentoo.org (x86@gentoo.org,
ppc@gentoo.org...). All arches (including "unsupported" arches) must be
called. But note that only "supported" arches (as defined in the policy) are
needed before the bug can advance to [glsa] status. You should periodically
check for new keywords in the ebuild, as sometimes they are changed without
a comment in the bug. As soon as the required KEYWORDS
are in the bug for all supported arches, the bug enters [glsa] status.
</p>

<p>
During a release preparation period you should also Cc: Release Engineering
(release@gentoo.org) on all bugs with [stable] status.
</p>

<p>
If the arch teams take too much time testing and changing the KEYWORDS, or
they refuse to mark stable a package due to outstanding problems, the bug
enters [stable+] status. We must track down arch-maintainers to have them
mark stable, help testing. You should also convince the arches that if they
discover a bug in the ebuild that already was in previous "stable" versions,
the ebuild should be marked "stable" anyway, even if it's not really stable,
as specified in the policy. If the KEYWORDS can't be met, the only other
option is to security-mask the package: there is no acceptable unaffected
version, so it is like if no acceptable upstream fix was provided.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Bugs in [glsa] status</title>
<body>

<p>
In [glsa] status, the security bug is corrected. We need to issue the GLSA
or close the bug without GLSA. The policy determines the cases where a GLSA
is needed and where a GLSA is not needed. There are also cases where a GLSA
vote must take place to decide if a GLSA is needed ([glsa?] status).
If at least two Security Team members vote for "no GLSA", then no GLSA should
be issued. The bug remains in [glsa] status until a GLSA is published.
</p>

<p>
When a GLSA is needed but nothing was sent, the bug enters [glsa+] status.
It's the case when the assigned GLSA coordinator did not draft and/or
made peer-reviewed and/or sent his GLSA. Other members of the Security Team
should take the lead at this point and finalize the GLSA.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Confidential vulnerability bug management</title>
<section>
<title>Status whiteboard rules</title>
<body>

<p>
Confidential bugs should be following this pattern: "RATING [status]
coordinator / Release_date CLASSIFIED", where:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Content</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>RATING</ti>
<ti>The vulnerability rating, following current policy rules</ti>
<ti>B3</ti>

<ti>[status]</ti>
<ti>The bug status, with optional extra information</ti>
<ti>[ebuild+]</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>coordinator</ti>
<ti>The nickname of the coordinator assigned to the bug</ti>
<ti>koon</ti>

<tr>
<ti>Release_date</ti>

<ti>20050106</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>CLASSIFIED</ti>
<ti>The optional CLASSIFIED flag for classified bugs</ti>
<ti>CLASSIFIED</ti>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
The following extra statuses are accepted in confidential bugs:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>preebuild</ti>
<ti>Specific package maintainer has been called to prepare an ebuild which
    should not be committed in the CVS tree</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>prestable</ti>
<ti>Specific arch testers has been called to test a not-yet-public ebuild</ti>
</tr>
</table>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Handling confidential bugs</title>
<body>

<p>
Semi-public bugs should be handled as public bugs, except that no herd or arch
alias should be Cc-ed on the bug but rather specific developers.
</p>

<p>
Confidential and classified bugs need extra care. The ebuild and files fixing
the vulnerability should NOT be committed to portage CVS, and no part of those
bugs should ever be discussed in public. Patches or portage overlay tarballs
can be attached to the bug, though. Testers will have to setup their own
overlay to test it.
The idea with those bugs is to prepare the ebuild and have it tested for the
coordinated release date, so that it can be released with all needed KEYWORDS
together with the GLSA at the same time the issue goes public.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>GLSA drafting with GLSAMaker</title>
<section>
<title>General rules</title>
<body>

<p>
The GLSA should use the affected software name with proper capitalization, not
the Gentoo package name. For example, you should use "MySQL" and not "mysql".
Lowercase names should be used only if the software has an all-lowercase name
or if the software is identified by its command name ("traceroute").
</p>

<p>
You should not copy any part of any existing advisory, but you may use
them as sources of information for our GLSA. If you copy, for example a
software description, from a website, please use a citation and quotes.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Title, Synopsis, Keywords</title>
<body>

<p>
The title must be short (&lt; 60 characters in most cases) and have the application
name (not category) in front. It should allow to clearly identify the
vulnerability, without getting into any details. Version should be left out,
except in rare cases where it allows to identify the package more clearly.
Multiple affected packages should be separated by a comma. Examples include:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>MySQL: Insecure temporary file creation</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Exim: verify=header_syntax buffer overflow</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Apache 1.3: Heap overflow in mod_redirect</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>MPlayer, xine-lib: Vulnerabilities in RTSP stream handling</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Synopsis is a short (&lt; 160 characters), but complete, description of the
vulnerability. People reading only the Synopsis should get a good idea what
the vulnerability is and what impact it has. Examples include:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>Two MySQL utilities create temporary files with hardcoded paths, allowing
an attacker to use a symlink to trick MySQL into overwriting important
data.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Multiple vulnerabilities, including remotely exploitable buffer overflows,
have been found in code common to MPlayer and the xine library.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The GLSA keyword category is typically set to "Ebuild" and should contain the
name of the main software vulnerable (for example, "MySQL"). Other keyword
types include "Portage" (for portage bugs) and "Infrastructure" (for server
compromises).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Access, Severity</title>
<body>

<p>
Access should be "Local" or "Remote". Local
vulnerabilities can be carried out only by a local user of the system. For
example it implies to run a specific executable to elevate privileges, or access
to a temporary directory to run a symlink attack. Remote vulnerabilities are
those that can be exploited by an attacker with or without an account on the
system. Remote vulnerabilities can either be active (exploiting a listening
server by sending malicious queries) or passive (enticing a user to connect
client software to a malicious server or to open malicious files).
</p>

<p>
Severity is an indication of how deep the vulnerability is. It is defined in
the Vulnerability Treatment Policy, in the table "Evaluate the vulnerability
type". Note that it depends only on
the maximum risk, not on the commonality of the configuration option at risk.
A buffer overflow allowing arbitrary code execution in a rare client software,
only when it uses a specific configuration option, theoretically remains a "High"
severity. A denial of service on all configurations of Apache theoretically
remains a "Normal" severity. In rare cases the severity may be adjusted, when
several members of the Security Team agree, to a more relevant level. For
example, a vulnerability allowing defacement of web sites on Apache and all
configurations should probably be "High" rather than "Normal".
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Unaffected, Vulnerable packages</title>
<body>

<p>
This section provides information about versions of packages that are
unaffected or vulnerable to the vulnerability described in this advisory.
You should pay special attention to those numbers as they are one of the
few areas where mistakes imply an errata publication.
</p>

<p>
There are the different fields composing an version entry. The package name
field must list the category and package name ("net-mail/exim"). Regarding
the "Architectures" field, you should put "*" in it when
the version description applies to all the arches marked in the ebuild.
You should use multiple entries for different arches if the version
description is different from arch to arch.
The "Auto" field must be set to true if the package is upgradeable
by emerge. For the version fields, there are multiple cases.
</p>

<impo>
In this section (and only in this section), the architectures should be
written as they appear in the KEYWORDS (i.e. "x86", "amd64", "sparc"...),
and not in uppercase.
</impo>

<p>
The simple case is when the vulnerability is present in all old versions,
and is fixed in all versions newer than a specific fix version. In this case,
you should use "&gt;= first fixed version" as unaffected and "&lt;= last
affected version" as vulnerable. You should double-check that there was no
ebuild between the last affected version and the first fixed version. When in
doubt, you should use "&gt;= first fixed version" as unaffected and "&lt; first
fix version" as vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
A more complex case is when the vulnerability is present only in a few recent
versions. Let's take the example of a package where 1.2.8-r2 was not affected,
1.2.9, 1.2.9-r1 and 1.2.9-r2 were affected, and 1.2.10 is fixed. In this case
there are two possibilities:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Unaffected</th>
<th>Vulnerable</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>&gt;=1.2.10</ti>
<ti>==1.2.9 ==1.2.9-r1 ==1.2.9-r2</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>&lt;=1.2.8-r2 &gt;=1.2.10</ti>
<ti>&lt;1.2.10</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Finally, when the package has no fixed version, you should omit the
"Unaffected" entry for that package and set "Auto" to "no".
</p>

<impo>
When the fix versions are complex, you should double-check that the XML and
TXT versions of the GLSA list your versions correctly.
</impo>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Background, Description, Impact</title>
<body>

<p>
The Background section gives information about the package at risk. It describes
briefly what it is and gives any information that is helpful in understanding
the part of the package vulnerable. The Background section should be shorter
than the Description section or the Impact section. Good examples include:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>The K Desktop Environment (KDE) is a powerful Free Software graphical
desktop environment. KDE makes use of URI handlers to trigger various
programs when specific URLs are received.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is an open-source network-transparent
version control system. It contains both a client utility and a server.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Metamail is a program that decodes MIME encoded mail. It is therefore
often automatically called when an email is received or read.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The Description section details what the vulnerability is, without telling what
happens when it is exploited. It should be understandable by people without
too much security background. Sometimes there is no information about the
vulnerability at all, in which cases you should let the description short. 
Good examples include:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>The telnet URI handler in Opera does not check for leading '-' characters
in the host name. Consequently, a maliciously-crafted telnet:// link may be
able to pass options to the telnet program itself. One example would be 
"telnet://-nMyFile" If MyFile exists in the user's home directory and the
user clicking on the link has write permissions to it, the contents of the
file will be overwritten with the output of the telnet trace information. If 
MyFile does not exist, the file will be created in the user's home
directory.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>The MySQL bug reporting utility (mysqlbug) creates a temporary file to
log bug reports to. A malicious local user with write access to the /tmp
directory could create a symbolic link of the name mysqlbug-N pointing to a
protected file, such as /etc/passwd, such that when mysqlbug creates the Nth
log file, it would end up overwriting the target file. A similar
vulnerability exists with the mysql_multi utility, which creates a temporary

</tr>
<tr>
<ti>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in the RTSP handling
code common to recent versions of these two packages. These vulnerabilities
include several remotely exploitable buffer overflows.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The Impact section describes the global impact of the vulnerabilities described
in the Description section, when exploited. It should focus on the maximum risk.
Good examples:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>A remote attacker, posing as a RTSP stream server, can execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user of the software playing the stream (MPlayer 
or any player using xine-lib). Another attacker may entice a user to use a 
maliciously crafted URL or playlist to achieve the same results.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>This exploit has two possible impacts. First, it may create new files in 
the user's home directory. Second, and far more serious, it may overwrite 
existing files that the user has write permissions to. An attacker with some 
knowledge of a user's home directory might be able to destroy important 
files stored within.</ti>

<section>
<title>Workaround, Resolution</title>
<body>

<p>
The workaround describes if there is any simple way (other than upgrading
to the fix version) of avoiding to be vulnerable. Good examples include:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>For a temporary workaround, providing you do not require Kerberos 4
support, you may turn off Kerberos 4 kadmin by running kadmind with the
--no-kerberos4 option.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
<ti>There is no known workaround at this time.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The Resolution section explains in human-readable terms what you have to do
to be fully protected against the vulnerability. This section must look like
this:
</p>

<pre caption="Resolution example">
All Heimdal users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
&lt;code&gt;
# emerge --sync
# emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-crypt/heimdal-0.6.2"
</pre>

<p>
If there are multiple architectures, it should look like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Multiple arch example">
OpenOffice.org users on the SPARC architecture should:
&lt;code&gt;
# emerge --sync
# emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-office/openoffice-1.1.0-r3"
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OpenOffice.org users on the PPC architecture should:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
# emerge --sync
# emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-office/openoffice-1.0.3-r1"
</pre>

<p>
If the GLSA is about a shared library, you should include the following
paragraph at the end of the Resolution section to warn about the
necessity to rebuild linked executables:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled.
Tools such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these
packages.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>References</title>
<body>

<p>
The References section should provide links to reference information about
the vulnerability. When a CVE number (CVE-XXXX-XXX) is available, it should
be provided (with the complete CVE number in "Title"). You can also link an
upstream developer advisory and/or
announce email, when available. You should avoid links to other distribution
advisories or non-official advisories from separate entities.

<section>
<title>Peer reviewing</title>
<body>

<p>
When the draft is finished, it must be submitted to the review of other members
of the Security Team, by calling for a review on the #gentoo-security channel.
The final version (after all corrections are made) must be approved by two
Security Team members before being committed and sent out.
</p>

<p>
When reviewing a GLSA draft carefully check the correctness of the
following things:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Affected/unaffected versions (Check ChangeLog that versions are
correct and make sure that there is no version not included by either
affected or unaffected).</li>
<li>Title correctness.</li>
<li>Severity and Access (Don't just rely on the bug rating and for
"Local" access a local account is needed otherwise it is "Remote").</li>
<li>Finally do a sanity check: Is this a real vulnerability and not
just a bug (like the Samba and Shadow non-vulnerabilities).</li>
</ul>
<p>
When the draft is approved, it must be assigned an official GLSA number. This
is done by calling the "Move" function in GLSAMaker to move the draft from the
pool to the official area.

<title>GLSA XML commit</title>
<body>

<p>
You need to commit the GLSA XML to the Gentoo CVS tree so that it automagically
appears in the RDF feed, the GLSA list, and the portage updates. You should
first update your GLSA directory in the gentoo CVS repository tree:
</p>

<pre caption="Update CVS tree">
you@home you $ <i>cd gentoo_cvs</i>
you@home gentoo_cvs $ <i>cvs update -dP gentoo/xml/htdocs/security</i>
</pre>

<p>
Then you should click <c>Fetch</c> on the GLSA to download the XML version,
and save it into your local gentoo_cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/security/en/glsa/
directory. Then you should add and commit the XML file:
</p>

<pre caption="Commit the GLSA">
you@home gentoo_cvs $ <i>cd gentoo/xml/htdocs/security/en/glsa</i>
you@home glsa $ <i>cvs add glsa-YYYYMM-NN.xml</i>
you@home glsa $ <i>cvs commit -m "GLSA YYYYMM-NN" glsa-YYYYMM-NN.xml</i>
</pre>

<title>E-mail announcement</title>
<body>

<warn>
Whenever you use a new setup (software or machine) to post a GLSA announcement,
you should get your setup checked by sending a test email to another member of
the Security Team.
</warn>

<p>
Click on the Txt download to have a text version of the GLSA. Check that the
affected/unaffected section looks good, then prepare an email with the
following rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>From</b> and <b>Return-Path</b> must be set to yourname@gentoo.org</li>
<li><b>To</b> and <b>Cc</b> should be set according to policy</li>
<li><b>Subject</b> must be "[ GLSA XXXXYY-ZZ ] Your vulnerability here"
    (you should copy/paste from the title in the Txt file)</li>
<li>the body of the mail should be the content of the Txt file, from the
"Gentoo Linux Security Advisory" header to the end of the file</li>
<li>email must be signed by the GPG key for your yourname@gentoo.org address</li>
</ul>

<note>
You will receive a return email from gentoo-announce telling it requires
moderation. Just reply to it and the announce email will get through.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Bug closing</title>
<body>

<p>
You should check that the email got through to gentoo-announce, then you can
close the related bug(s), by setting their status to <b>RESOLVED/FIXED</b>,
with a comment pointing to the GLSA number.

<title>Errata/Update publication</title>
<body>

<p>
An errata is published when we made a mistake otherwise it is an
update. When policy warrants a republication these guidelines should be followed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Revision should be correctly set in XML. This means that revision might need to
be manually corrected in GLSAMaker data directory, if you do multiple
changes using GLSAMaker ( ie. &lt;revised&gt;September
10, 2004: 02&lt;/revised&gt;)</li>
<li>If there is no vulnerability no affected packages should be listed
in the XML</li>
<li>Title can change ( ie. GLSA 200409-14 for Samba and GLSA 200411-01 for ppp)
</li>
<li>Not all Errata need republication. Policy details when
republication is needed.</li>
<li>For the text version GLSAmaker can add the relevant information to
updates and erratas. Manually follow the instructions provided by
GLSAmaker.</li>
<li>Text version must contain an Errata or Update section (example shown below) and AFTER THAT only the
sections changed (XML version does not have extra sections)</li>
</ul>

<table>
<tr>
<ti>This advisory incorrectly described ppp as being vulnerable to a
remote denial of service. After further verifications, it appears that a
remote user can only deny service to himself, so this bug does not induce any
security issue at all. The corrected sections appear below.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
