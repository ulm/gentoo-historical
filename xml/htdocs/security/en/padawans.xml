<title>Padawans</title>
<body>

<p>
The recruitment process for security developers is somewhat different from
the mainstream recruitment process. Knowledge of Gentoo specifics is not
as important as it is for other developers, since they won't have commit
rights to the portage tree. On the other hand, they must have a good
security background and must progressively be given more responsability.
Security recruits in training will be called <b>padawans</b> throughout
this document.

<p>
To become a padawan, you'll have to submit an application with your
background and qualifications to 
<mail link="security@gentoo.org">security@gentoo.org</mail>.
You'll have to join us on IRC on the #gentoo-security channel to
get a feel of how we work. You can read the 
<uri link="/security/en/coordinator_guide.xml">GLSA Coordinator Guide</uri>
and if you're still interested in the job, you can start as a Scout.

<p>
First step in joining the team is to be a scout. You will have to
follow major security lists and websites (your choice) and submit bugs
for things that are not yet in the
<uri link="http://tinyurl.com/3nyg7">current Security bugs</uri>.
Search for duplicates in resolved bugs before submitting !
</p>

<ul>
<li>You will need: A 
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/createaccount.cgi">Gentoo bugzilla
account</uri></li>
<li>We will provide you: Nothing</li>
</ul>

If you do a good job as a scout, you'll be invited to be an apprentice.
You will be asked to draft and review GLSAs in progress.
</p>

<ul>
<li>You will need: To learn the
  <uri link="/security/en/vulnerability-policy.xml">Security Policy</uri>
  and the

<body>

<p>
Remarkable GLSAs and dedication will bring you to the next step. You'll be
offered to be a real GLSA Coordinator and attain developer status. You'll
have to coordinate your bugs and see that they get resolved.
</p>

<ul>
<li>You will need: to provide everything required to be a Gentoo
    developer</li>
<li>We will provide you: A Gentoo developer account, security@gentoo.org

<p>
At the end of your probation period, you'll be made a full GLSA Coordinator
and you will be able to commit and send your own GLSAs. Glory and bounces
will come to you.
</p>

<ul>
<li>You will need: Tears and sweat</li>
<li>We will provide you: GLSA commit rights, gentoo-announce
    posting rights, www_glsamaker group membership, Padawans approval

<title>Senior Security Developer</title>
<body>

<p>
To reach the holy grail of the padawans path and have almost infinite powers,
you'll have to pass through classic developer quizzes to gain portage CVS
commit rights. You'll have to prove you don't have a life outside
#gentoo-security. Then you will be granted masking powers.
</p>

<ul>
<li>You will need: Successful Gentoo developer quizzes</li>
<li>We will provide you: Portage commit rights for package masking</li>
</ul>
