<p>
The Gentoo infrastructure team maintains serveral rsync mirrors. This
rotation is called <c>rsync.gentoo.org</c>. The <c>SYNC</c> variable in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path> is set to this rotation by default.
These mirrors are located globally and may not be the fastest for your location,
however, they are very reliable.

<p>
The following is the listing of individual Portage rsync mirrors that are run
by the community. Community mirrors come and go, but they are monitored to make
sure that they are up to date. It is advised to use a rotation instead of a
single mirror directly. This helps spread out the load and provides a failsafe
in case a specific mirror is offline.
