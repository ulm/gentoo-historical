<b><uri link="/proj/en/releng/catalyst/">Catalyst</uri></b> is the tool used by
the Release Engineering team to create all Gentoo releases. Catalyst is capable
of creating installation stages, GRP sets, and bootable LiveCDs.
</p>

<p>
<b><uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/tenshi/">Tenshi</uri></b> is a log
monitoring program, designed to watch one or more log files for lines matching
user defined regular expression and report on the matches. The regular
expressions are assigned to queues which have an alert interval and a list of
mail recipients. 
</p>

<p>
<b><uri link="/proj/en/dynfw.xml">The dynfw firewall scripts</uri></b> are a
collection of netfilter-based (<c>iptables</c>) firewall scripts designed to
allow for an immediate, measured response against pending security threats.
These <c>bash</c> scripts have been designed to work with nearly any
netfilter-based firewall (including both "allow by default" and "deny by
default" configurations).
</p>

<p>
<b><uri link="/proj/en/site.xml">The XML projects page</uri></b> contains the
complete <c>guide</c> XSLT engine that is used to create this entire site,
including the main pages and online documentation. On this page, you can
find a tarball that contains the complete sources that were used to generate the
latest version of the <uri>http://www.gentoo.org</uri> Web site -- the one you
are viewing now.
