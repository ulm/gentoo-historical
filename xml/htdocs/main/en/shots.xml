<title>(Almost) default GNOME</title>
<body>

<p>
Bartek's shot is one of Gentoo Screenshot Contest winners. Bartek got this
decent look by illusion of 3d wallpaper connected with arrangement of pretty
icons. This is good example of how a default theme can be used to create a
beautiful screenshot.

<title>Elegant black WM</title>
<body>

<p>
The second winner of Gentoo Screenshot Contest is Miko≈Çaj aka mklimek, who is a
KDE user so far, and he doesn't look to change that. On his exclusive screenshot
you can see some KDE's utilities and  icons which looks kinda gnome-like.

<title>Space trip</title>
<body>

<p>
Robert's screenshot demonstrates an appealing use of blue hues. Excluding
cairo-clock, his KDE runs (as we can notice) qt-based only applications, as
Kopete, Konsole and amaroK. Robert also cares about his irssi theme, which is
distinguished by green colors.

<title>Even more gentooish</title>
<body>

<p>
That is probably the most "Gentooish" screenshot here ever and personally for
me it is the most beautyful. Alexander runs  GNOME, which not only looks pretty
but also befits a Gentoo workstation.

<title>Emerge that!</title>

As you will notice, Massimiliano is going to build media-video/dvdauthor on his
KDE box.

<title>Minimal beauty</title>
<body>

<p>
The second pretty screenshot of Bartek's desktop. This time he runs fluxbox with
his "dark theme" whatever that means. But the hidden beauty of the screenshot
is sane connection of audacious theme, fluxbox's theme and wallpaper.

<title>Default things can be pretty too</title>
<body>

<p>
A fellow who goes by Purple (whether that is his nickname or real name we don't
know) submitted his nice-looking screenshot of KDE displaying yakuake during sync
process, and conky. All composed with decent wallpaper makes it unusual.

<title>Darkclown Coronado</title>
<body>

<p>
Darkclown (don't ask) submitted his nice-looking screenshot, displaying the
vista-Inspirate icons by saki and the gears desktop by ChristianNickel. His
desktop is a KDE environment with Plastik window decorations and keramik style.
You'll also notice karamba plugins like liquid weather and cynapses aero.

<title>Scott S Short</title>
<body>

<p>
Scott's box uses the 2.6.14-gentoo-r2 kernel with Gnome 2.12, showing off the
Milk 2.0 theme. All icons originated from the Gentoo web site.

<title>Richard Head</title>
<body>

<p>
Richard is one of our many Gentoo users who is impressed with Gentoo's
flexibility. He describes his screenshot as "pretty cool", showing mp3 player,
system status information, transparent terminals and menu and a root tail of a
port scan.
