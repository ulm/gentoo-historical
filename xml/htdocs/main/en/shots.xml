<title>E17 elf overlay (Chopinzee)</title>
<body>

<p>
	<b>First place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
WM = E17 built from the official efl overlay with itask-ng. WM theme is
A-SBlack2.edj for the main, grey.edj for the clock, and detour-glossy-red.edj
for the itask-ng bar. Wallpaper is Black_wall.edj gimp'd to properly render @
1920x1080. Terminals are x11-terms/terminal, GTK theme is crude. Application
running in the busy shot is Mixxx. Compositor is ecomp with the ecomorph module.
Icons on the itask-ng bar are "Token Light"

<title>Simple is Beautiful (whtwtr)</title>
<body>

<p>
	<b>Second place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
Simple is beautiful *but* It must be functional and provide the user with
tangible information.   
</p>

<p>
Shawn's box currently runs compiz as the window manager with xfce-panel. The
wallpaper is plain old #000000 (black). 2 Conky v1.0.8 instances renders the
desktop eye-candy - The rings represent cpu usage (large white rings), memory
usage (green ring), and file system usage (yellow rings). Also, the bottom info
bar with uptime, temps, up/download speeds, calendar and curent time. The globe
image is taken from die.net and is a "Mollweide" projection of the earths
day/night shadow and I use cron + a small script to update the image every hour.
(The clouds are updated every 3hrs.) Cool eh!

<title>XFCE from xfce-dev overlay (GentooApologetin)</title>
<body>

<p>
	<b>Third place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
Custom XFCE from xfce-dev (overlay) ~amd64-desktop running compiz-fusion, modded
Salmon GTk2 theme, recolored Humanity Colors icon theme, conky and pcmanfm2 for
the desktop, lxterminal and fine tuned claws-mail. It's completely lightweight
and runs stable enough as my everyday main system.

<p>
	<b>Fourth place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
The judges liked Michał's  balance between icon theme, background, custom conky
fonts and the whole look of his desktop.

<title>(Almost) default GNOME</title>
<body>

<p>
Bartek's shot is one of Gentoo Screenshot Contest winners. Bartek got this
decent look by illusion of 3d wallpaper connected with arrangement of pretty
icons. This is good example of how a default theme can be used to create a
beautiful screenshot.

<title>Elegant black WM</title>
<body>

<p>
The second winner of Gentoo Screenshot Contest is Mikołaj aka mklimek, who is a
KDE user so far, and he doesn't look to change that. On his exclusive screenshot
you can see some KDE's utilities and  icons which looks kinda gnome-like.

<title>Space trip</title>
<body>

<p>
Robert's screenshot demonstrates an appealing use of blue hues. Excluding
cairo-clock, his KDE runs (as we can notice) qt-based only applications, as
Kopete, Konsole and amaroK. Robert also cares about his irssi theme, which is
distinguished by green colors.

<title>Even more gentooish</title>
<body>

<p>
That is probably the most "Gentooish" screenshot here ever and personally for
me it is the most beautyful. Alexander runs  GNOME, which not only looks pretty
but also befits a Gentoo workstation.

As you will notice, Massimiliano is going to build media-video/dvdauthor on his
KDE box.
