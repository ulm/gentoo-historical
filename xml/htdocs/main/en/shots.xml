<title>E17 EFL overlay (Chopinzee)</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>First place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
The window manager is E17, built from the official EFL overlay with
<c>itask-ng</c>. The window manager theme is A-SBlack2.edj for the main,
grey.edj for the clock, and detour-glossy-red.edj for the <c>itask-ng</c> bar.
The wallpaper is Black_wall.edj <c>gimp</c>ed to properly render at 1920x1080.
The terminals are <c>x11-terms/terminal</c>, GTK theme is "crude." The
application running in the busy shot is <c>mixxx</c>. The compositor is
<c>ecomp</c> with the <c>ecomorph</c> module. The icons on the <c>itask-ng</c>
bar are "Token Light."

<title>Simple is Beautiful (whtwtr)</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>Second place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
Simple is beautiful <e>but</e> it must be functional and provide the user with
tangible information. 
</p>

<p>
Shawn's box currently runs <c>compiz</c> as the window manager with
<c>xfce4-panel</c>. The wallpaper is plain old #000000 (black). Two
<c>app-admin/conky-1.8.0</c> instances render the desktop eye-candy. The first
<c>conky</c> instance powers the ring meters. The rings represent cpu usage
(large white rings), memory usage (green ring), and file system usage (yellow
rings). The second <c>conky</c> instance runs the bottom info bar with uptime,
temps, up/download speeds, calendar and curent time. The globe image is taken
from die.net and is a "Mollweide" projection of the earth's day/night shadow and
He uses <c>cron</c> plus a small script to update the image every hour. (The
clouds are updated every three hours.) Cool, eh?

<title>Xfce from the xfce-dev overlay (GentooApologetin)</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>Third place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
Mona's custom Xfce environment is from the xfce-dev overlay. It's on an ~amd64
desktop running <c>compiz-fusion</c>, modded Salmon gtk2 theme, recolored
Humanity Colors icon theme, <c>conky</c> and <c>pcmanfm2</c> for the desktop,
<c>lxterminal</c> and a fine-tuned claws-mail instance. It's completely
lightweight and runs stable enough as her everyday main system.

<title>Gnome Lover's Dream (shpaq)</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>Fourth place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
The judges liked Michał's balance between icon theme, background, custom
<c>conky</c> fonts and the whole look of his desktop.

<title>Simple Elegance (nm)</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>Fifth place 2010 screenshot contest!</b>
</p>

<p>
The window manager is <c>dwm</c>. Terminal emulator: <c>urxvt</c>. Wallpaper: of
unknown origin. Font: Proggy Tiny Slashed Zero.

<title>(Almost) default GNOME</title>
<body>

<p>
Bartek's shot is another of the screenshot contest winners. Bartek got this
decent look by using the depth illusion of a 3D wallpaper along with clever
arrangement of pretty icons. This is good example of how a default theme can be
used to create a beautiful screenshot.

<title>Elegant black WM</title>
<body>

<p>
Another winner of Gentoo Screenshot Contest is Mikołaj, a.k.a. mklimek, who is a
KDE user so far, and he doesn't intend to change desktops. On his screenshot you
can see some KDE utilities and icons . . . which looks kinda Gnome-like.

<title>Space trip</title>
<body>

<p>
Robert's screenshot demonstrates an appealing use of blue hues. Excluding
<c>cairo-clock</c>, his KDE runs only Qt-based applications: <c>kopete</c>,
<c>konsole</c>, and <c>amarok</c>. Robert also cares about his <c>irssi</c>
theme, which is distinguished by green colors.

<title>Even more gentooish</title>
<body>

<p>
That is probably the most "Gentooish" screenshot here ever and personally for me
it is the most beautiful. Alexander runs Gnome with the Lila icon set, which not
only looks pretty but also befits a Gentoo workstation.

<title>Emerge that!</title>

As you can tell, Massimiliano is going to build <c>media-video/dvdauthor</c> on
his KDE box.
