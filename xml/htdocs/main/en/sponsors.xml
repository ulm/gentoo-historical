Lumen Software utilizes Gentoo as the base Linux distribution in all our
pre-configured server products. Lumen Software's EzThin Server products
are pre-configured Linux server solutions that provide a complete
solution for the small office to a large scale enterprise organization.
EzThin features pre-installed applications (productivity software,
graphics, etc.), virtual desktops (maintenance free and require no base
OS), remote access, centralized user and user desktop management,
automated server updates and more. Lumen Softwares development has
focused on creating an environment that allows organizations to take

experience or training. This focus has culminated into the EzThin Server
solutions we have today, with EzThin Server certified partnerships with
Dell and Gateway.</p>

<title>Source and rsync mirrors</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo relies heavily upon a global network of rsync and source mirrors.
Without these mirrors, access to new packages, updates to the Portage tree and 
new releases of Gentoo Linux would be impossible.  Some mirrors are provided by
individuals, others by companies. You can find a complete listing on our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">Gentoo mirrors page</uri>.
