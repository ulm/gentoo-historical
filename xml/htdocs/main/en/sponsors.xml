<title>Source and rsync mirrors</title>
<body>
	<p>
	Gentoo Linux relies heavily upon a global network of rsync and source mirrors.  Without these mirrors, access to new packages, updates to the Portage tree and new releases of Gentoo Linux would be impossible.  Some mirrors are provided by individuals, others by companies.  Below is a sampling of some of our mirror providers:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th><th>Mirror Type</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><uri link="http://www.ibiblio.org">ibiblio</uri></td><td>Source</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><uri link="http://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</uri></td><td>rsync</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><uri link="http://www.netoptex.com">GNI</uri></td><td>rsync</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	<note>Since some sponsors wish to remain anonymous, we only list mirrors here upon request.  If you would like to see your mirror added to this list, please contact <mail link="klieber@gentoo.org">Kurt Lieber</mail></note>
