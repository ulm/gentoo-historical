<title>Source and rsync mirrors</title>
<body>
	<p>
	Gentoo Linux relies heavily upon a global network of rsync and source mirrors.  Without these mirrors, access to new packages, updates to the Portage tree and new releases of Gentoo Linux would be impossible.  Some mirrors are provided by individuals, others by companies.  Below is a sampling of some of our mirror providers:</p>
	<table>
