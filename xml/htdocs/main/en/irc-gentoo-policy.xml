<title>Reasoning</title>
<body>

<p>
Currently #gentoo is an extremely large channel of users, numbering
close to 1000 users. It is also the homefront of people trying out Gentoo
for the first time. Because of this, it needs a more structured form
to handle things.
</p>

<section>
<title>#gentoo Structure</title>
<body>

<p>
The structure of #gentoo will be as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tor Users: Level 10 - Currently because of the inability to 
  successfully manage the actions of tor users, the entire domain is silenced. 
  This access is for autovoice, which will let them speak.</li>
  <li>Level 20 for developers.  Developers will be able 
  to <c>OP</c> themselves, but cannot handle general channel management such
  as <c>AKICK</c> and adding other users.</li>
  <li>Level 30 for staff - This is for staff, or people that help manage day to
  day #gentoo tasks. They are allowed access to the <c>AKICK</c> function.</li>
  <li>Level 40 for admins - This is for toplevel managment. Said persons will 
  be able to do things such as alter the access list for adjusting permissions.</li>
</ol>

<title>Rules</title>
<body>

<ul>
  <li>Only Gentoo Developers can be level 40 admins.</li>
  <li>Only staffs and up can deal with .tor user applications. This is because 
  they best understand how #gentoo operates, and who can cause problems.</li>
  <li>Developers can obtain status in the channel by request to an admin.</li>
  <li>Inactive users without a good reason will have their access downgraded or
  removed depending on the situation.  Inactive is defined as 2 weeks.</li>
  <li>Currently, bans are set for 2 weeks, after which they will be removed.  
  If a user is banned 3 times, they are immediately put in the AKICK list.</li>  
  <li>Ban complaints should be sent to: <mail>ops@gentoo.org</mail></li>
  <li>Public discussion should be sent to the public access gentoo-ops mailing 
  list or to #gentoo-ops.</li>
  <li>AKICK is a serious ban.  Only a full agreed vote of all active admins and
  staff (other than the staff member in question) can remove it!</li>
</ul>
