<p>
We produce Gentoo Linux, a special flavor of Linux that can be automatically
optimized and customized for just about any application or need. Extreme
configurability, performance and a top-notch user and developer community are
all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to a technology called Portage, Gentoo Linux can become an ideal
secure server, development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system,
embedded solution or something else -- whatever you need it to be. Because of
its near-unlimited adaptability, we call Gentoo Linux a <b>meta</b>distribution.
</p>

<title>What is Portage?</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>Portage</b> is the heart of Gentoo Linux, and performs many key functions.
For one, Portage is the <e>software distribution</e> system for Gentoo Linux.
To get the latest software for Gentoo Linux, you type one command: <c>emerge
--sync</c>. This command tells Portage to update your local "Portage tree" over 
the Internet. Your local Portage tree contains a complete collection of scripts
that can be used by Portage to create and install the latest Gentoo packages.
Currently, we have <uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org/">more than 8000 
packages</uri> in our Portage tree, with new ones being added all the time.
</p>

<p>
Portage is also a <e>package building and installation</e> system.  When you
want to install a package, you type <c>emerge packagename</c>, at which point
Portage automatically builds a custom version of the package to your exact
specifications, optimizing it for your hardware and ensuring that the optional
features in the package that you want are enabled -- and those you don't
want aren't.
</p>

<p>
Portage also keeps your system <e>up-to-date</e>. Typing <c>emerge -u
world</c> -- one command -- will ensure that all the packages that <e>you</e>
want on your system are updated automatically.
</p>

<p>
Portage will keep your Gentoo Linux system as "up-to-date" as you desire.
And because of this, experienced Gentoo users don't pay too much attention to
"new versions" of Gentoo Linux -- after all, the latest and greatest version
of Gentoo Linux is always available by typing an <c>emerge --sync</c> command. 
There's no need to wait several months for a "new version" of Gentoo Linux to
be released because Gentoo Linux is continually updated and refined and these
improvements are immediately made available to you.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we do roll up official CD releases of Gentoo Linux so that new
Gentoo Linux installs are as up-to-date as possible from the start. Here's an
overview of what is included in the most recent release of Gentoo Linux: 
</p>	

<ul>
<li>Support for x86, AMD64, PowerPC, UltraSparc, Alpha and MIPS processors</li>
<li>LiveCD-based installation for x86, AMD64, PowerPC, UltraSparc and Alpha</li>
<li>Latest stable KDE and GNOME</li>
<li>Various optimized Linux kernels</li>
<li>Very modern GNU development environment</li>
<li>Excellent filesystem support: ReiserFS, XFS, ext3, EVMS, LVM</li>
<li>Excellent hardware support: NVIDIA, Creative Labs Live! and Audigy</li>
<li>Modular OpenGL and compiler sub-system (supports multiple co-existing versions)</li>
<li>Clean, dependency-based system initialization scripts</li>
<li>New "hardened" Gentoo security initiative</li>
<li>more than 8000 packages of the latest and greatest software</li>
<li>Enhanced Portage capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the power, flexibility and speed of Gentoo Linux appeals to you, then
we encourage you to give it a try. We don't think you'll be disappointed.

<title>Gentoo's History</title>
<body>

<p>
It all began with Extra Time. Time to explore, Time to discover, Time to 
experiment. That's how the creator of Gentoo, Daniel Robbins stepped into the 
world of Linux. He started with Debian Linux, setup a couple of applications, 
learnt the ins &amp; outs of Linux and as most Linux users do, tried out a 
couple of distributions and settled to help out with a distro called Stampede 
Linux. Soon he was into Stampede development and working on their package 
management system. After a period of time and due to certain issues, he 
moved on and decided that he would create his own distribution.
</p>

<p>
Thus, Enoch was born. Daniel wanted Enoch to be a blazingly fast distro with 
capabilities to completely automate the package creation and upgrading process. 
Soon there was a #enoch on irc.freenode.net and 10 developers helping with the 
distro. Over a period of time, as Enoch started improving, they felt that it 
needed a new name. They called it Gentoo Linux. Around about the time Gentoo was
moving to its 1.0 release, Daniel bought a new, fast machine. The motherboard 
model had a faulty chip that caused Linux to lock up when idle and because of 
that, Gentoo Linux development came to a complete halt.
</p>

<p>
Since there wasn't anything going on with Gentoo, Daniel switched to FreeBSD. 
He liked what he saw. Especially the "Ports" system. And he returned to the 
Linux world. Along with the help of other developers like Achim Gottinger, 
Gentoo was back on track &amp; charging ahead. The whole package management 
system was redesigned &amp; called Portage. Gentoo has been in active 
development ever since, with tons of features being continually added over 
the years. Teams of volunteers help keep Gentoo on the bleeding edge and 
patched to ensure maximum security &amp; stability.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo development model was extended with a complete project-based
approach where each project develops independently but cooperatively with other
Gentoo projects. Regular meetings between the project leads (called "project 
managers") keep the development high-paced. The Gentoo Foundation has been 
created to provide financial caretaking, juridical protection and oversee 
general Gentoo development to keep it in line with the <uri
link="/main/en/contract.xml">Social Contract</uri>.
</p>

<p>
In April 2004, Daniel decided to resign from his development responsibilities 
within Gentoo. We are all very grateful for all the work that Daniel has put in
Gentoo and wish him the best.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo still continues to grow, evolve and improve itself - new projects are
added, new developers are joining, new packages are added every day. The Gentoo
developer and user community is undoubtedly Gentoo's strongest value.
