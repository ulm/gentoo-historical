<title>Gentoo Linux in a paragraph</title>
<body>

<p>We produce Gentoo Linux, a special flavor of Linux that can be automatically
optimized and customized for just about any application or need. Extreme
performance, configurability and a top-notch user and developer community are
all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.  </p>

<p> Thanks to a technology called Portage, Gentoo Linux can become an ideal
secure server, development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system,
embedded solution or something else -- whatever you need it to be. Because of
its near-unliminted adaptability, we call Gentoo Linux a
<b>meta</b>distribution.  </p>

<title>What is Portage?</title>
<body>

<p><b>Portage</b> is the heart of Gentoo Linux, and performs many key functions.
For one, Portage is the <i>software distribution</i> system for Gentoo Linux.
To get the latest software for Gentoo Linux, you type one command: <c>emerge
sync</c>. This command tells Portage update your local "Portage tree" over the
Internet. Your local Portage tree contains a complete collection of scripts that
can be used Portage to create and install the latest Gentoo packages.
Currently, we have <uri link="/dyn/pkgs/index.xml">over 4000 packages</uri> in
our Portage tree, with new ones being added all the time.</p>

<p>Portage is also a <i>package building and installation</i> system.  When you
want to install a package, you type <c>emerge packagename</c>, at which point
Portage automatically builds a custom version of the package to your exact
specifications, optimizing it for your hardware and ensuring that the optional
features in the the package that you want are enabled -- and those you don't
want aren't.</p>

<p>Portage also keeps your system <i>up-to-date</i>. Typing <c>emerge -u
world</c> -- one command -- will ensure that all the packages that <i>you</i>
want on your system are updated automatically.</p>

<title>Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc4</title>
<body>
	
<p>Portage will keep your Gentoo Linux system as "up-to-date" as you desire.
And because of this, experienced Gentoo users don't pay too much attention to
"new versions" of Gentoo Linux -- after all, the latest and greatest version
of Gentoo Linux is always available by typing an <c>emerge sync</c> command. 
There's no need to wait several months for a "new version" of Gentoo Linux to
be released because Gentoo Linux is continually updated and refined and these
improvements are immediately made available to you.
</p>

<p>Of course, we do roll up official CD releases of Gentoo Linux so that new
Gentoo Linux installs are as up-to-date as possible from the start. Here's an
overview of what is included in the recent 1.4_rc releases of Gentoo Linux: </p>	

<ul>
<li>Support for x86, PowerPC, UltraSparc and Alpha processors</li>
<li>LiveCD-based installation for x86 and PowerPC</li>
<li>KDE 3.1.1a and GNOME 2.2.1</li>
<li>Various optimized Linux kernels (2.4.20, 2.4.21_pre)</li>
<li>Very modern GNU development environment (glibc 2.3, gcc 3.2.2)</li>
<li>Excellent filesystem support: ReiserFS, XFS, ext3, EVMS, LVM</li>
<li>Excellent hardware support: NVIDIA, Creative Labs Live! and Audigy</li>
<li>Modular OpenGL and compiler sub-system (supports multiple co-existing

<li>Clean, dependency-based system initialization scripts</li>
<li>New "hardened" Gentoo security initiative</li>
<li>4000+ packages of the latest and greatest software</li>
<li>Enhanced Portage capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>If the power, speed and flexibility of Gentoo Linux appeals to you, then
we encourage you to give it a try. We don't think you'll be disappointed.</p>
