<title>Searching for support?</title>

<p>
Gentoo Linux is a volunteer-driven distribution. It is not possible
for us to provide immediate support (paid or otherwise) because we just don't
have the resources to do so.
</p>

<p>
We have however a great Gentoo community that tests, helps and documents many
aspects of the Gentoo distribution. We advise you to direct your support
questions to the <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Forums</uri>, <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">Gentoo Mailinglists</uri> or <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/irc.xml">Gentoo Chat Channels</uri>. Those
are far better suited for support questions as they represent a major part of
the "common" knowledge about Gentoo Linux.
</p>

<p>
Most Gentoo developers frequently visit those community channels and try their
best to contribute to the ongoing discussions and questions.
