<title>Gentoo Social Contract</title>
<section>
<body>	

<p>
This social contract is intended to clearly describe the overall development 
policies and standards of the Gentoo project development team.  Parts of this 
document have been derived from the <uri 
link="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Social Contract</uri>. It
is generally very similar to it except that certain parts have been clarified 
and augmented while other parts deemed redundant have been removed.  Comments 
are welcome.  Please send	them to our <mail 
link="gentoo-dev@gentoo.org">gentoo-dev@gentoo.org</mail> mailing list.

<title>What is Gentoo?</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo in itself is a collection of free knowledge. Knowledge in this context 
can be defined as documentation and metadata concerned with concepts or domains
relevant to operating systems and their components, as well as <uri
link="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</uri>
contributed by various developers to the Gentoo Project.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo, the operating system, is derived from the base concept of
knowledge described above. A Gentoo operating system should satisfy the
self-hosting requirement. In other words, the operating system should be
able to build itself from scratch using the aforementioned tools and
metadata. If a product associated with an official Gentoo project does
not satisfy these requirements, the product does not qualify as a Gentoo
operating system.
</p>

<p>
An official list of Gentoo projects is listed under the <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/metastructure/projects.xml">Gentoo
Metastructure</uri>. A Gentoo project does not need to produce a Gentoo
operating system in order to be officially recognized.

<title>Gentoo is and will remain Free Software</title>
<body>

<p>
We will release our contributions to Gentoo as free software, metadata or
documentation, under the GNU General Public License version 2 (or later, at 
our discretion) or the Creative Commons - Attribution / Share Alike version 2 
(or later, at our discretion). Any external contributions to Gentoo (in the form
of freely-distributable sources, binaries, metadata or documentation) may be 
incorporated into Gentoo provided that we are legally entitled to do so.  
However, Gentoo will never <e>depend</e> upon a piece of software or metadata 
unless it conforms to the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General 
Public License, the Creative Commons - Attribution/Share Alike or some other 
license approved by the Open Source Initiative (<uri

</p>

<note>
We are considering extending the above clause to require that all core
Gentoo components must conform to a license approved by the OSI 
<e>and</e> Free Software Foundation (<uri

<title>We will give back to the Free Software Community</title>
<body>

<p>
We will establish relationships with Free Software authors and collaborate with
them when possible.  We will submit bug-fixes, improvements, user requests, etc.
to the "upstream" authors of software included in our system.  We will also 
clearly document <e>our</e> contributions to Gentoo as well as any 
improvements or changes we make to external sources used by Gentoo (whether in 
the form of patches, "sed tweaks" or some other form).  We acknowledge that our
improvements and changes are much more meaningful to the larger Free Software
community if they are clearly documented and explained, since not everyone has
the time or ability to understand the literal changes contained in the patches
or tweaks themselves.

<title>We will not hide problems</title>
<body>

<p>
We will keep our <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">bug report database</uri> 
open for public view at all times; reports that users file online will 
immediately become visible to others. 
</p>

<p>
Exceptions are made when we receive security-related or developer relations 
information with the request not to publicize before a certain deadline.
