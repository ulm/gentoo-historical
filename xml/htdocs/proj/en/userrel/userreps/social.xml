<title>User Representatives - Social Contract</title>
<section>

<p>
To accomplish our goals, it is important that both users and developers 
feel comfortable in dealing with us. So we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always treat users with respect. Every user is capable of contributing something to Gentoo, 
if not today, then in the future.</li>
<li>Never to discourage potential future contributers based on user's current knowledge or lack 
thereof.</li>
<li>Always treat developers with respect. This includes respecting the fact that all developers 
are volunteers with limited time. (We want developers to recieve the information they need to make 
good decisions about what to spend their time on, but ultimately it is the developers who will 
determine their own priorities and goals)</li>
</ul>
<p>User Representatives who violates the social contract risk having their status revoked.</p>
