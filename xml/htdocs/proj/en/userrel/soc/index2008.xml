<description>
The Gentoo Summer of Code subproject oversees Gentoo's participation in the
annual Google Summer of Code program.</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
For the fourth year running, Google is organising a 
<uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</uri>, funding students
to work on open-source projects over the summer. Applications for mentoring organizations start soon and Gentoo is hoping to be accepted once again.

<title>Project Ideas</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
As of yet Gentoo is unaware of how many slots have been allocated.
Some project ideas are below:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Project</th>
    <th>Details</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>Sandbox improvements</ti>
    <ti>Since Martin (azarah) has been busy and then was retired, there was nobody working full-time on sandbox, yet it's one of the core utilities that Gentoo uses; Martin left an experimental branch of sandbox, which has code used for Gentoo/FreeBSD support in it. At the moment that sandbox fails badly with Linux modules, and is non trivial to fix. Having someone cleanup sandbox code and ensure that building continues to occur in a safe environment from the running system is of critical importance.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<ti>Autoepatch</ti>
	<ti>Autoepatch was a project to replace gnuconfig.eclass and elibtoolize that you find used in quite a few ebuilds to help ensure packages build correctly. Its goal is to apply common patches and fixes to source code after the unpacking but before you get to the compile phase. Ensuring that common mistakes made in source code, such as a broken autotools issue, is resovled before you have to fix it on an ebuild by ebuild basis.</ti>
  </tr>
<tr>
      <ti>Eselect GCC</ti>
      <ti>Eselect is Gentoo's configuration too for selecting versions or linguas of applications that have multiple instances that can fulfill a need. A previous attempt at making a selector for gcc, caused far more problems then what it was attempting to resolve. This should be a 100% compatible reimplementation of gcc-config and binutils-config.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
      <ti>Eselect modules</ti>
      <ti>Eselect is Gentoo's configuration too for selecting versions or linguas of applications that have multiple instances that can fulfill a need. There are many applications such as tar, whois, cpio, sendmail, and countless others that are different versions/implementations of the same application. Eselect is ideal for allowing you to have multiple versions of these applications installed but having the default system version be selected via the Eselect framework. Adding more modules will allow users to have better control over their various packages.</ti>
