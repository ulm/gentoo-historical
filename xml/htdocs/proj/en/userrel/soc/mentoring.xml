<title>Summer of Code mentoring guide</title>
<author>antarus</author>
<abstract>This guide is intended to be read by anyone who is interested
in mentoring students for Gentoo in the Google Summer of Code.
Interested mentors need not be Gentoo developers; anyone interested in
mentoring should be able to make a case as to why they want to mentor should
the SOC team have questions.

<title>What it is to be a Mentor</title>
<section>
<title>Attributes</title>
<body>
<ul>
  <li><b>Willing</b> - A mentor should be willing to mentor.  Mentoring is not a
  forced activity and it is not required.  A mentor should not mentor
  half-heartedly.  The Summer of Code experience is a great experience for
  students and part of that experience is having some help along the way.  It
  is also a great opportunity to recruit new people into a project and this
  opportunity should not be squandered.  Of course mentoring also offers a
  great opportunity for friendship.</li>
  <li><b>Informed</b> - A mentor should know what they are signing up for; generally
  by reading this document.  A mentor should be aware of the time requirements
  and any mentor who knows they cannot devote the time required should probably
  take a back-seat role; perhaps as a secondary or backup mentor.</li>
  <li><b>Capable</b> - A mentor should be capable of mentoring for the given task.
  Knowledge of the language the student is using is important as is knowledge
  of the problem domain.  The student will (hopefully) be asking questions
  about the project and their implementation (and as a mentor you should
  arguably be questioning their implementation as you review it.)</li>
  <li><b>Sociable</b> - A mentor should try to foster a relationship with the student.
  It is important to critique the students work in a professional manner.
  Complaints about rudeness and abuse should be filed to the GSoC team lead
  and/or the Google Summer of Code staff.</li>
</ul>

<title>Process</title>
<body>
<p>Being a mentor is about getting to know the student, helping the student,
critiquing the student and insuring the student is making progress.  These are
roles generally performed by a 'Tech Lead' or 'Project Manager'.  A person
interested in mentoring should be prepared to do these tasks.</p>
<p><b>Helping the Student</b>:
The mentor should assist the student with common questions about the domain
area, implementation and language specifics.  As a mentor you should not write
the code for the student; however using unrelated examples that can communicate
your point to the student are a good tool.</p>
<p><b>Critiquing the student</b>:
As a mentor you should review the student's work on a regular basis and communicate daily. A 
student's chances of being on schedule <uri 
link="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/08/contact-early-contact-often.html">go 
down dramatically</uri> if you're in contact less than once a day. Even 
twice a week is far worse than daily. You and the student should discuss 
meeting times, number of meetings, and meeting duration. It is important 
that you as a mentor ensure the student is staying on track and and is 
meeting the deadlines set forth in their application.  If there are road 
blocks that are hindering the student's progress you should aid the 
student in overcoming them.

<title>Applying to be a Mentor for GSOC 2013</title>
<body>
<p>
Applications for mentorship are now open. You can apply on the <uri 
link="http://www.google-melange.com/">gsoc webapp</uri>. Once you apply, you 
will be contacted by the program administrators (dberkholz, calchan, or antarus) 
to answer some questions about mentoring and why you have elected to be 
a Mentor.  Mentor selection is currently decided at the sole descretion 
of the program administrators.  All mentors should have sufficient 
involvement within the Gentoo community to support their application.

<title>Evaluating student proposals</title>
<body>
<p>
Please read and score all proposals so that we don't bias our scores 
toward ones that have more "experts" but may be less important. If you 
are an expert on specific topics, please be sure to review your 
proposals as quickly as possible so the rest of us can better judge the 
student's understanding of his project and his likelihood of success 
with it.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't participated before, note that there are both public and 
private comments. Public comments are seen by the student, and we expect 
the student to respond. Poorly communicating students will be 
down-ranked accordingly. Private comments are for use to discuss the 
student with the other mentors.
</p>

<p>
Please spend at least 5-15 minutes on each proposal for which you are 
not the expert (varying based on your experience level in evaluation and 
your reading speed).
</p>

<p>
The primary goal of our participation in GSoC is to get new developers 
&mdash; when you are reading proposals, consider the quality of the student 
your #1 priority. Of course an awesome student tends to be highly 
correlated with an awesome proposal, but also consider their likelihood 
of them sticking around once the summer ends. We would rather have a new 
developer than one summer's effort.
</p>

<p>
Once all mentors have had a chance to evaluate the proposals, the 
organization adminstrator will take their rankings into account, as well 
as his own expertise and the selection criteria mentioned above, in 
creating the final list of students.

<title>The role of the organization administrator</title>
<body>

<p>
The organization administrator is ultimately responsible for the success 
of the program. In Google's eyes, this means both <uri 
link="http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/NotesonStudentAllocations">passing 
students and new developers</uri> &mdash; this is one reason for our 
focus on potential developers versus a summer's work from someone who 
will never return. Administrators are expected to have experience with 
GSoC and will be knowledgeable about all aspects of the program, 
including the high standards expected of students and proposals, the 
culture of the Google Summer of Code program, and what it takes for 
projects to be successful. Admins should have good relationships with 
the Google employees running GSoC, to <uri 
link="http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/org-application/">maximize 
our chances</uri> of being selected for GSoC in the future. They are 
Gentoo's primary contact with Google.
</p>

<p>
Administrators ensure that a good list of project ideas is submitted, 
write the organization application, select mentors, make final student 
selections, ensure mentoring is going well, resolve any conflicts, and 
are generally responsible for anything outside of mentoring individual 
students. The administrator has the final word on all aspects of the 
program, from mentor selection to student ranking.
