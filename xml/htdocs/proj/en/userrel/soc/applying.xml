<title>What interested students need to do</title>
<section>
<title>Get feedback on your idea</title>
<body>
<p>Students interested in applying to do a project for Gentoo should review
the projects <uri link="index.xml">listed</uri>.  You are free to apply for a
project that is not on our list.  In either case once you have an idea of what
you want to work on you should find someone to discuss it with it.  The
gentoo-soc mailing list, #gentoo-soc on irc.freenode.net or any of the
listed <uri link="index.xml">mentors</uri> should be able to provide feedback.

<section>
<title>Write a proposal</title>
<body>
<p>Students should author a proposal that attempts to convince Gentoo why
their project should be chosen over other competing proposals.  A few sentences
is not sufficient in most cases to sway anyone.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Objective - What problem does the project solve.  This does not need to
  be a long section.  Generally software tries to help make people more
  efficient, or foster communication, or entertain folks.  Any proposed
  software should have a purpose and applicants should define that purpose
  here.</li>
  <li>Abstract - What does the project do; try to keep this section to one
  paragraph.  It should not be an in depth analysis but is helpful when
  someone desires an overview of the project.</li>
  <li>Deliverables - What will the project consist of when it is finished?
  Source code, documentation, a build system, libraries, binaries; these should
  all be enumerated in your proposal.  Without a concrete set of deliverables
  it is difficult to judge if a student finished their proposal.  If it is
  difficult to judge if the proposal was finished, it is difficult to pay for
  the work as well.</li>
  <li>Timeline - When will the deliverables be done?  This is <b>very</b>
  important for the mid-term evaluation as the mentor has to determine if a
  given student has made enough progress to award them money.  A student should
  strive to make this as easy for the mentor as possible by providing a bar
  to be measured by and then meeting that bar.  A student should be careful to
  make good judgements in time costs and if the student slips behind he/she
  should alert their mentor to this fact and explain why the estimates were
  wrong.</li>
  <li>Biography - The student should talk about themselves: where they are from
  what they like to study, what they do in their free time, etc.  Part of this
  contest is to make new friends and learn about each other and this is an
  important part of that goal.  This section should include things like previous
  jobs, internships, and any educational experience an applicant may have.  This
  section is also intended to promote oneself and convince Gentoo that we should
  chose a given student over other applicants.</li>
