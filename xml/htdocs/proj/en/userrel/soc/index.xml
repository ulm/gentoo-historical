<title>Project Ideas</title>

<p>
As of yet Gentoo is unaware of how many slots have been allocated.
Some project ideas are below:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Project</th>
    <th>Details</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>equizApp</ti>
    <ti>Create a system that allows Gentoo recruiters and developers
        to submit questions into a database.  The questions should be
        categorized by subject.  This system should also allow a user
        to create a quiz from the set of questions and the user should
        be able to specify how many questions per category.  The system
        should also store the answers to each question and hide them when
        generating a quiz.  The system may optionally support a voting or
        reporting mechanism such that people can report bad questions.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>Gentoo-Bugger</ti>
    <ti>Create an application by which a user can report bugs to Gentoo.
        This will require interfacing with bugzilla; users should be able
        to report bugs and the application should do a fairly decent job
        of trying to find duplicate bugs prior to filing a new bug.  This
        app would be great because misfiled bugs take up a lot of developer
        resources.  Since bugs filed with this app would be very uniform;
        Gentoo could pull more metrics out of bugzilla.</ti>
