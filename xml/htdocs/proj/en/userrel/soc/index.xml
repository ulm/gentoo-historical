<description>
  The Gentoo Summer of Code subproject oversees Gentoo's participation in the
  annual Google Summer of Code program.
</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
  For the fourth year running, Google is organising a 
  <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</uri>, funding
  students to work on open-source projects over the summer. Applications for
  mentoring organizations start soon and Gentoo is hoping to be accepted once
  again.

<p>
  As of yet Gentoo is unaware of how many slots have been allocated.
  Some project ideas are below:

    <ti>Sandbox improvements</ti>
    <ti>
      Since Martin (azarah) has been busy and then was retired, there was
      nobody working full-time on sandbox, yet it's one of the core utilities
      that Gentoo uses; Martin left an experimental branch of sandbox, which
      has code used for Gentoo/FreeBSD support in it. At the moment that
      sandbox fails badly with Linux modules, and is non trivial to fix.
      Having someone cleanup sandbox code and ensure that building continues
      to occur in a safe environment from the running system is of critical
      importance. It would also be useful to port sandbox to other operating
      systems such as: Darwin, Solaris, *BSD and more.

  <tr>
    <ti>Autoepatch</ti>
    <ti>
      Autoepatch was a project to replace gnuconfig.eclass and elibtoolize
      that you find used in quite a few ebuilds to help ensure packages build
      correctly. Its goal is to apply common patches and fixes to source code
      after the unpacking but before you get to the compile phase. Ensuring
      that common mistakes made in source code, such as a broken autotools
      issue, is resovled before you have to fix it on an ebuild by ebuild
      basis.
    </ti>
    <ti><mail link="flameeyes@gentoo.org">Diego Pettenò</mail></ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>Eselect modules</ti>
    <ti>
      Eselect is Gentoo's configuration tool for selecting versions or linguas
      of applications that have multiple instances that can fulfill a need.
      There are many applications such as tar, whois, cpio, sendmail, package
      managers (portage, paludis, pkgcore), and countless others that are
      different versions/implementations of the same application. Eselect is
      ideal for allowing you to have multiple versions of these applications
      installed but having the default system version be selected via the
      Eselect framework. Adding more modules will allow users to have better
      control over the various packages.
    </ti>

  <tr>
    <ti>scanmacho</ti>
    <ti>
      A program that scans mach-o files and returns information to that
      provided by the scanelf tool.
    </ti>
    <ti></ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>busybox package rescue applet</ti>
    <ti>
      An applet for busybox that aids users in fixing a broken system by
      merging gentoo binary packages (tbz2 format) to the live filesystem.
      This applet would be embedded (minimal size) written in C and it should
      handle things like atom parsing and dependency calculation as well as
      installing packages to the live filesystem properly (currently tar and
      bzip2 'work' but do not write the correct metadata.)
    </ti>
    <ti></ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>OpenPAM-compatible modules for basic login on Linux</ti>
    <ti>
      Gentoo supports already two PAM implementations, but they are tied to one
      operating system only: Linux-PAM (sys-libs/pam) on Linux and OpenPAM
      (sy-auth/openpam, plus sys-freebsd/freebsd-pam-modules) on FreeBSD. Being
      able to choose between either implementation on either operating system is
      one of the long term goals of the PAM team. The first step would be to
      produce a set of single PAM modules compatible with both Linux and
      OpenPAM that could replace Linux-PAM and its default set of PAM modules.
