<longdescription>

<p>
  For the fourth year running, Google is organising a 
  <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</uri>, funding
  students to work on open-source projects over the summer. Gentoo has been
  accepted for Summer of Code 2008.

    <ti>Sandbox improvements</ti>
    <ti>
      Since Martin (azarah) has been busy and then was retired, there was
      nobody working full-time on sandbox, yet it's one of the core utilities
      that Gentoo uses; Martin left an experimental branch of sandbox, which
      has code used for Gentoo/FreeBSD support in it. At the moment that
      sandbox fails badly with Linux modules, and is non trivial to fix.
      Having someone cleanup sandbox code and ensure that building continues
      to occur in a safe environment from the running system is of critical
      importance. It would also be useful to port sandbox to other operating
      systems such as: Darwin, Solaris, *BSD and more.

    <ti>Autoepatch</ti>
    <ti>
      Autoepatch was a project to replace gnuconfig.eclass and elibtoolize
      that you find used in quite a few ebuilds to help ensure packages build
      correctly. Its goal is to apply common patches and fixes to source code
      after the unpacking but before the the compile phase. Ensuring that
      common mistakes made in source code, such as a broken autotools
      issue, is resolved before someone has to fix it on an ebuild by ebuild
      basis is a very useful thing for developers and saves time.

  <tr>
    <ti>Eselect modules</ti>
    <ti>
      Eselect is Gentoo's configuration tool for selecting versions or linguas
      of applications that have multiple instances that can fulfill a need.
      There are many applications such as tar, whois, cpio, sendmail, package
      managers (portage, paludis, pkgcore), and countless others that are
      different versions/implementations of the same application. Eselect is
      ideal for allowing you to have multiple versions of these applications
      installed but having the default system version be selected via the
      Eselect framework. Adding more modules will allow users to have better
      control over the various packages.

    <ti>busybox package rescue applet</ti>
    <ti>
      An applet for busybox that aids users in fixing a broken system by
      merging gentoo binary packages (tbz2 format) to the live filesystem.
      This applet would be embedded (minimal size) written in C and it should
      handle things like atom parsing and dependency calculation as well as
      installing packages to the live filesystem properly (currently tar and
      bzip2 'work' but do not write the correct metadata.)

    <ti>OpenPAM-compatible modules for basic login on Linux</ti>
    <ti>
      Gentoo supports already two PAM implementations, but they are tied to one
      operating system only: Linux-PAM (sys-libs/pam) on Linux and OpenPAM
      (sy-auth/openpam, plus sys-freebsd/freebsd-pam-modules) on FreeBSD. Being
      able to choose between either implementation on either operating system is
      one of the long term goals of the PAM team. The first step would be to
      produce a set of single PAM modules compatible with both Linux and
      OpenPAM that could replace Linux-PAM and its default set of PAM modules.

    <ti>
      Portage/ebuild ability to use file-base capabilities rather than setuid.
    </ti>
    <ti>
      With recent Linux kernels, file-based capabilities are available. It is
      thus possible to give the ping command just the minimum capabilities
      needed to access the RAW socket, rather than leaving it entirely setuid. A
      long term goal for Gentoo would be to allow the user to choose
      capabilities over setuid for (at least some) programs. To support this 
      feature however, Portage needs a means to copy over capabilities from one
      file to another. A python extension may be needed to handle this.

    <ti>
      Portage support for multiple extraction tools.
    </ti>
    <ti>
      Some ebuilds refer to source packages that upsteam releases with formats
      different from tarballs (either gzip or bzip2), like ZIP or tarball
      compressed with LZMA. Right now, to unpack these, the ebuilds depend on a
      specific decompression tool like <c>app-arch/unzip</c>, even if the system
      might already have something like <c>app-arch/libarchive</c> installed
      that can handle it. A better way to handle this would be to have a set of
      virtual ebuilds that depend on at least one of a given set of tools that
      extract a specific format (like <c>virtual/portage-unpack-zip</c>), and
      a set of scripts that can find the best tool available on the system to
      do the unpacking.

      Portage/Pkgcore/Paludis backend adapter for PackageKit
    </ti>
    <ti>
      PackageKit is a UI for getting packages installed.  Currently there is no
      backend support for Gentoo-based package managers.  This project would
      consist of authoring the correct adapters to allow PackageKit to utilize
      one or more existing Gentoo package managers such that users could use
      PackageKit on Gentoo.
