Adopt a Developer Resource Request Form
Revision 1.0 - 28 July 2006

Instructions: Developers, use this form to request resources.
Send a completed copy to adopt-a-dev@gentoo.org from your @gentoo.org 
e-mail address.

* What resource are you requesting? Be sure that the resource is well 
defined. Think, can someone reading this determine if they have the 
right hardware to fill the request?

WinTV Theater model 495

* What is the purpose? The purpose must be related to Gentoo and 
clearly stated.

There is a new package called FactTV (a fork of MythTV) and it supports 
multiple simultaneous input sources. To fully test the software, I 
require a second video capture card. 

* What project(s) benefit from you getting the resource? You must name 
at least 1.

This will benefit the Gentoo Video Disk Recorder (VDR) project which I 
am a member of.

* What is your general location? This helps prospective donors 
determine approximate shipping charges.

Chicago, IL, USA.

* When did you become an official developer? Note, you must have been an 
official Gentoo developer for at least 6 months before requesting or 
receiving resources through adopt a developer.

<p>
When you see an e-mail like this one and want to process it, send a 
reply to <mail>adopt-a-dev@gentoo.org</mail> stating that you will 
handle the request. Sending an e-mail to the alias lets other project 
members know that the request is being taken care of. This avoids 
duplicate work.

<title>Required Information</title>
<body>

<p>
The following is a list of information required before posting a 
developer request. If the developer did not provide all of the 
information, he or she should be contacted to get the required 
information.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>resource</b> -
    The resource must be well defined. Think, can someone reading
    this determine if they have the right hardware to fill the request?
    For example, if the developer asks for "2 sticks of 128MB RAM", the 
    donor doesn't know what speed (i.e. PC100, PC133, etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>purpose</b> - 
    The purpose must be clear and related to Gentoo. The
    adopt-a-dev project member shouldn't judge the merit of the 
    purpose. For example, a request from an alpha developer for a 
    wireless network card to test/keyword wireless-tools shouldn't be 
    rejected because few users would use wireless on an alpha. Rather, 
    the adopt-a-dev project member should ensure that there is a 
    Gentoo related purpose (i.e. the hardware isn't just for personal 
    enjoyment) and that the purpose is clearly stated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>project</b> -
    The project(s) that benifit from the developer getting the hardware
    should be listed as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>location</b> -
    The developer should give his or her general location. This helps 
    prospective donors determine approximate shipping charges. If the 
    developer fails to provide his or her location, the information
    can usually be found on the <uri 
    link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/userinfo.xml">roll
    call</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>dev time</b> -
    The developer must state when he or she became an official Gentoo 
    developer because he or she must have been an official Gentoo 
    developer for at least 6 months before requesting or 
    receiving resources through adopt a developer.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Required Information</title>
<body>

<p>
The following is a list of information required before posting a

information, he or she should be contacted to get the required 
information.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>

    The resource must be well defined. A developer must be able to
    determine if the hardware fits his or her need and will work on
    his or her system.

<title>Entering the Data</title>
<section>
<title>Logging into the Web Application</title>
<body>

<p>
The project maintains a web application for managing all of the project 
information. When you join the project you will be given access 
information (URI, username, and password). Use them to log in. If you 
are having troubles, contact the project lead.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Adding the Person</title>
<body>

<p>
If the developer or donor have not requested or offered any resources, 
then their name, e-mail address, and location need to be added to the 
system. This can be done in the "Add/Change People" section.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Adding a Project</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are entering a developer request and the related project(s) are 
not in the system yet, then you can add them in the "Add/Change Project" 
section.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Adding a Resource</title>
<body>

<p>
To add a request or an offer for a resource you must add the resource to 
the system in the "Add/Change Resource" section. There are 4 possible 
status options.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>seeking</b> - select this status when a developer is requesting (i.e. 
seeking out) a resource. Qnty, Resource, Dev, Purpose, and Project are 
required fields.
</li>

<li>
<b>offering</b> - select this status when a community member is offering 
to donate a resource. Qnty, Donor, and Resource are required fields.
</li>


<li><b>hidden</b> - select this when you want the record to be hidden from 
the main project page. You may want to use this status when you have 
connected a developer and a donor, but the developer has not yet 
recieved the resource.</li>

<li><b>thanks</b> - select this status when a developer has gotten a 
resource. Qnty, Donor, Resource, Dev, Purpose, and Project are

<title>Generating the Project Page</title>
<section>
<title>Intro</title>
<body>

<p>
Manually editing the project page to add, change, and remove resource 
listings is prone to errors. Since the database contains all of the 
information for the project page, we will use the web application to 
output the xml for the project page.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Get the XML</title>
<body>

<p>
After you've made changes with the web application you will need to 
update the project page. From within the web application, right click on 
"Generate Project Page" and save it.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Look for Errors and commit</title>
<body>

<p>
Look at the document to make sure there were no errors when it was 
automatically generated. You may also want to run it through xmllint and 
repodoc. Once you are satisfied that the document is error free, commit 
it to cvs normally.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Send a confirmation e-mail</title>
<body>

<p>
Send an e-mail to the developer who made the request or the donor who 
offered the resource to let them know that their resource has been added 
to the list. Also, CC the adopt-a-dev alias so that the other project members
know the request/offer has been taken care of.

<section>
<title>The Connection</title>
<body>

<p>
Once a developer requests something that a user is offering or once a 
user offers something that a developer has requested, there are a few 
things that need to be done.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    E-mail the list telling the project members that you'll handle 
    the request (as above).
  </li>
  <li>
    If the item is already listed on the project page, then log into the 
    web application and set its status to hidden. Follow the procedures 
    above to generate a new project page and commit it to CVS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get both the developer and community member e-mail address. These 
    can be found in the e-mails or through the web application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send an e-mail to both the developer and community member telling 
    them to contact each other to arrange getting the item to the 
    developer. Also remind the developer to let us know when we he/she
    got the item so that we can list the donor in the 'Thank You' 
    section.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>After the developer gets the resource</title>
<body>

<p>
As instructed in the e-mail outlined above, the developer should e-mail 
us once the resource has arrived. If he/she hasn't e-mail us, then 
he/she should be contacted a few weeks after to check if he/she got the 
item.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If the developer sends us an e-mail to let us know about 
    receiving the item, then you should reply to the alias and to let 
    the other project members know that you are handling it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Log into the web application and set the status of the resource to 
    'thanks'.  Follow the procedures above to generate a new project 
     page and commit it to CVS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send an e-mail to the developer thanking him or her for 
    participating, remind him/her that we encourage him/her to write 
    publicly about the resource, and remind him/her to thank the donor 
    if he/she already hasn't done so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send an e-mail to the donor. Thank him/her for donating the 
    resource.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Misc.</title>
<section>
<title>Stale Entries</title>
<body>

<p>
Each offer or request is dated. If the offer or request has been list 
for more than 3 months, then the developer or community member is 
contacted to inquire if the resource is still available/needed and if it 
should remain listed on the project page. If no response is received 
within 2 weeks, then the listing is removed.
