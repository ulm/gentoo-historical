<description>Planet Gentoo provides a central aggregation of developers' blogs, to keep users
and other developers informed of what they are working on</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
For a long time, users have been asking for a better way to find out about
what developers
are working on within Gentoo, and developers have been wanting a way to communicate with the
user and developer communities. Planet Gentoo aims to provide a partial solution to both of
these, by aggregating developers' weblogs in one place.
</p>

<p>
This aggregation is currently available in two forms. Planet Gentoo shows only
posts marked
as 'on-topic', and related to Gentoo development. Gentoo Universe shows all posts to that
developer's blog, for those who are interested in more than strictly
Gentoo-related news.

<title>Avatars</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Planet Gentoo and Gentoo Universe can display an icon or headshot of the
developer on the website.
</p>

<p>For ease of maintenance, we use gravatars (globally recognized avatars) which the developer can manage personally.  Users can create their own gravatar at <uri>http://www.gravatar.com/</uri>.  By default, the MD5 string we use to access the personalized avatars is username@gentoo.org.  If you already have an account under a different e-mail address and would like to use that instead, please contact a developer to have your configuration updated.</p>
