  <longdescription>The Gentoo Linux Security Audit Project is focused upon
  auditing packages for security issues. The aim of the project is to audit
  as many of the packages available through Gentoo Linux stable Portage tree
  as possible for potential flaws.</longdescription>

    <body>
    <p>
    Due to the sheer size of the portage tree, it is infeasible for this
    project to be able to audit all the packages. The system of prioritizing
    is based on the time, risk factor, motivation and skills necessary to
    audit a given package.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are several packages available within the portage tree which
    are designed to aid source code audits. Some of the these include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>dev-util/flawfinder</li>
      <li>dev-util/rats</li>
      <li>dev-util/pscan</li>
      <li>app-forensics/examiner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Each of the general scanning tools will include output describing
    the flaw detected, and possibly giving advice on how the code can be
    fixed. For example the following is taken from the output of RATS
    describing the dangers of getenv: <e>"Environment variables are highly
    untrustable input. They may be of any length, and contain any data.
    Do not make any assumptions regarding content or length. If at all
    possible avoid using them, and if it is necessary, sanitize them and
    truncate them to a reasonable length."</e>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you need any further advice on how to correct a hole which has been
    reported you should study a book on programming securely, such as
    the <e>Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO</e> by David A. Wheller.
    (Remember that when reporting security issues a patch closing the hole
    is greatly appreciated).

    <title>Submitting found flaws</title>
    <body>
    <p>
    When you find a vulnerability, you should write a vulnerability
    description and submit it for peer-review as a new security bug
    (with "Gentoo Security" as product and "Auditing" as component,
    restricted to Gentoo Security). Other auditors (and security team members)
    will double-check what you found, ensure that it is indeed a bug
    with a security impact.
    </p>
    <p>
    When it has been thoroughly peer-reviewed, it will
    be cleared to go upstream as a "Gentoo Security Audit Subproject" sighting.
    Depending on its severity and how the package is common amongst
    distributions, it might need to be coordinated with vendor-sec for
    coordinated release and CAN number attribution.
    </p>
    <impo>
    Please do not submit non-peer-reviewed vulnerabilities to any disclosure
    channel (including upstream) under the Gentoo name or a gentoo.org email
    address. Nothing hurts more our credibility than issuing Gentoo-branded
    bogus vulnerability reports.
