       <title>Making a New Kernel Source</title>
       <body>
       <p>
	 Adding a new kernel source into the tree is not recommended by the Gentoo Security Team.  Unless it is a kernel source you think could be used by a wide number of users, please end your consideration here and simply use an overlay.  If you do believe that it is, you must be willing to become the security maintainer.  Being the security maintainer for a kernel source means being willing to devote a significant amount of time to closing security bugs for that kernel source.  Additionally, you must take care that your kernel source never falls into hardmasking.  If it does, your kernel source will automatically lose Gentoo Security support, and may be subject to tree removal.
