<p>
Mailmin was created by Nicholas Adams and Zack Gilburd after they realized that there was a great demand for a frontend that would allow system administrators easily manipulate and control the MySQL database that powered their virtual mailhost systems.  After a slow start, they had something that actually worked.
</p>
<p>
In the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/virt-mail-howto.xml">Virtual/Mailhost Postfix Howto</uri>, users are instructed to create a MySQL database that will control their new mailhost.  Mailmin is not designed to do this for the user, however it is designed to help the user administrate the database post-creation.  While Mailmin is still in the alpha stages, 90% of it is usable and functional.  It can be emerged through path emerges or through unmasking it manually.
