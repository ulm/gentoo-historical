  <description>
    The Gentoo/PowerPC Project supports and maintains Gentoo Linux on PowerPC
    processors, including both of the 32 bit and 64 bit variants.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
    <p>The Gentoo/PowerPC Project was formed to ensure that Gentoo is the most
    up to date and robust PowerPC distribution available for both server and 
    desktop applications. The Gentoo/PowerPC project maintains both the 32 bit 
    PowerPC Linux port and the 64 bit PowerPC Linux port. Supported 32 bit 
    PowerPC processors include the 4xx/6xx/7xx/74xx series processors, as
    found in Apple computers, as well as many embedded PowerPC devices, 
    including the Efika.  Supported 64 bit PowerPC processors include the 970,
    as found in Apple G5's, the Cell Broadband Engine, as found in the PS3, and
    assorted POWER processors. Additionally, a 32 bit userland is provided for 
    64 bit PowerPC machines.</p>

    <p>Bugs are tracked and resolved from the 
    <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo bug tracker</uri>.  Note that 
    because of architectual differences, packages are marked for 
    <uri link="http://tinyurl.com/34byx">32 bit UL</uri> and
    <uri link="http://tinyurl.com/2oxbbl">64 bit UL</uri> seperately and should be assigned 
    accordingly.</p>

    <p>The Gentoo/PowerPC team can be reached in a multitude of ways. End users
    can find help on the 
    <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/">forums</uri>,  
    <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">PowerPC mailing lists</uri>
    and on IRC in the #gentoo-powerpc channel on 
    <uri link="http://freenode.net">Freenode</uri>.  A member of the PowerPC 
    team is almost always available on IRC.  Note that all bugs should be  
    directed to bugzilla to ensure that the issue is resolved.</p>

  <goals>
  
    <p>The goal of the Gentoo PowerPC development project is to guarantee that
    the PowerPC packages built using Gentoo metadata (ebuilds) are functional 
    and up to date.  By continuously testing new packages, maintaining 
    existing packages and providing user support, the Gentoo PowerPC team 
    provides the PowerPC user with a modern distro based on community, 
    performance and freedom.  Utilizing Gentoo's metadata based distribution 
    allows a user to to be as bleeding edge or as conservative as desired.
    </p>

    <p>Gentoo is unique because all of its supported architectures share the 
    same generic ebuilds, which describe how to build packages.  These 
    packages are combined to form the foundation of this distribution.  The
    PowerPC developers are responsible for building and testing ebuilds and
    marking them as tested or stable.  For the 32 bit port, the stable keyword
    is <b>ppc</b>, while the unstable keyword is <b>~ppc</b>.  For the 64 bit
    port, the stable keyword is <b>ppc64</b> while the unstable keyword is 
    <b>~ppc64</b>.  Our users can use these keywords, along with the portage
    application, to build a system that suits their needs, whether it is a
    stable server or a bleeding edge desktop system.</p>

        <title>2008-01-16: Gentoo/PPC and Gentoo/PowerPC64 have merged</title>
	<body>
	  <p>
	  The Gentoo/PPC and Gentoo/PowerPC64 teams have historically been 
	  seperate entities.  However, the overlap between the groups was so
	  substantial that the groups voted to combine to reduce overhead.  In
	  the future, release media for the 32 bit and 64 bit ports will be 
	  combined, but due to architectual differences, seperate keywords will
	  be maintained.

        <p>Can you make computers do amazing things? Are you excited about
        exploring areas of computing never explored before? We are continuously
        looking for volunteers willing to spend some of their free time on this
        project.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in helping, but don't have a niche that you 
	are interested in filling, you can always look through our bugs. There
	are always packages that need to be tested, bugs waiting to be found 
	and fixed and enhancements waiting for someone to code them. Feel free
	to ask the PowerPC development team on IRC what <e>you</e> can help us
	with!</p>
