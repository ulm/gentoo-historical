  <name>Gentoo MIPS</name>

  <description>
	The Gentoo/MIPS Project provides the Gentoo GNU/Linux operating 
	system for mips-based platforms.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
	Gentoo/MIPS is a port of the Gentoo GNU/Linux and the Gentoo 
	Portage package management system to mips-based platforms.  Primary 
	focus is on the Silicon Graphics (SGI) line of mips-based workstations, 
	specifically the Indy and Indigo2.  Support is also available for the
	Cobalt Microserver Qube2/RaQ2 units and the SGI O2 R5000 units.

      <title>(29 Sep 2005): New Developer, Joel Martin (a.k.a kanaka)</title>
      <body>
        <p>We've grown again.  Please make a warm welcome for Joel Martin, who
        has joined the MIPS team to assist with toolchain issues and clustering.</p>

      <title>(16 Sep 2005): Site Updates</title>
      <body>
        <p>Another big gap in the site updates (over a year), and so there's
	lots to update people about.</p>

	<p><b>New developers:</b></p>
	<p>3 new developers joined the MIPS team in this period.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Aaron Walker</b> (ka0ttic) is helping with the porting &amp;
	  arch testing efforts</li>
	  <li><b>Stephen Bennett</b> (spb) is helping with porting SELinux to
	  MIPS, and looking after security matters</li>
	  <li><b>Stuart Longland</b> (redhatter) is helping with maintenance of
	  the handbook, and the Cobalt port</li>
	</ul>

        
	<p><b>Gentoo/MIPS Handbook Updated:</b></p>
	<p>
	  The Gentoo/MIPS handbook has been <e>completely</e> rewritten from
	  scratch, and now is available in its 
	  <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-mips.xml">new home</uri>.  In
	  addition, we have a shiny new
	  <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-mips-faq.xml">FAQ page</uri> to answer the
	  most common questions.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>Gentoo/MIPS LiveCD News:</b></p>
	<p>
	  Joshua Kinard has also been busy with the Gentoo/MIPS LiveCD.  This is
	  a boot CD for booting up Silicon Graphics Indy, Indigo2, Indigo2
	  Impact, O2, Origin 200/2000 and Octane systems.  It's still very
	  experimental, but has come a long way from the early attempts.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You can find the CD, as well as instructions on how to burn &amp; use
	  it on your local Gentoo <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirror</uri>
	  under <c>gentoo/experimental/mips/livecd/</c>.  Please read the
	  README file you find there -- these are not ISO images, and require
	  special treatment regarding the burning process.
	</p>

	<p><b>Gentoo/MIPS 2005.0 &amp; 2005.1 Stages:</b></p>
	<p>
	  Gentoo 2005.0 has been released for some time now.  2005.1 is also
          available for SGI systems (the Cobalt 2005.1 images are in hiatus
          pending <uri
          link="http://stuartl.longlandclan.hopto.org/blog/2005/09/10/further-glibc-hell/">glibc
          issues</uri>).  You'll now find stages on your local Gentoo
          <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirror</uri> in the following
          locations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Big Endian 2005.1</b> (for SGI systems):
            <c>gentoo/releases/mips/2005.1</c>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Little Endian 2005.0</b> (for Cobalt systems):
            <c>gentoo/experimental/mips/stages/cobalt/2005.0</c>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Gentoo/MIPS Hardware Support Page:</b></p>
        <p>
          Stuart Longland knocked up a very simple hardware support database, to
          assist users in finding kernel configuration settings for their
          hardware and known working combinations.  The site allows users to
          post any kernel configs settings and success/failure stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find this database
          <uri link="http://stuartl.longlandclan.hopto.org/gentoo/mips/">here.</uri>
          Contact Stuart Longland if you have any issues using this service.
          (and be patient when downloading from that site... it's hosted on a
          slow 512/128k ADSL link)

      <title>(21 Jul 2004): Site Updates</title>
      <body>
        <p>It's been awhile since the last update to the site, so people are likely wondering what all 
           has been going on recently.  For starters, we have a new developer to join the team, 
           Hardave Riar.  He joined a couple weeks ago to assist in various porting tasks, but will 
           also assist in Octane work as Linux support for the system becomes better.</p>

        <p>Newer stages for the 2004.2 release are available at the following locations:<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SGI: <uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/releases/2004.2/</uri></li>
          <li>Cobalt: <uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/cobalt/releases/2004.2/</uri></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The official release date for 2004.2 was missed, so the stages are only on the above site 
           for now.  2004.3 should be our next official release.</p>

      <body>
        <p>We have yet another new developer to join the MIPS ranks!  Stephen Becker, a.k.a. geoman, will 
	also work on Xfree86/Desktop related stuff, with Bret (psi29a).</p>

      <body>
        <p>We have a new developer to join the MIPS ranks.  Please give a warm welcome to Bret Curtis, 
	a.k.a., psi29a.  Bret will be handling stuff in the Xfree86 and Desktop related sections, like KDE, 
	Gaim, X-Chat and such.  As an example of what Xfree86 and KDE 3.x looks like on an Indy desktop, 
	take a look at the three screenshots below:</p>
