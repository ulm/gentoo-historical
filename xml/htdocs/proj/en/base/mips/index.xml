  <name>Gentoo MIPS</name>

  <description>
	The Gentoo/MIPS Project provides the Gentoo GNU/Linux operating 
	system for mips-based platforms.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
	Gentoo/MIPS is a port of the Gentoo GNU/Linux and the Gentoo 
	Portage package management system to mips-based platforms.  Primary 
	focus is on the Silicon Graphics (SGI) line of mips-based workstations, 
	specifically the Indy and Indigo2.  Work is also underway for 
	Gentoo/MIPS support on SGI O2 systems and hopefuly in the future, 
	Gentoo/MIPS will expand to Cobalt mips-based systems as well.

        <p>We have a new developer to join the MIPS ranks.  Please give a warm welcome to Bret Curtis, 
	a.k.a., psi29a.  Bret will be handling stuff in the Xfree86 and Desktop related sections, like KDE, 
	Gaim, X-Chat and such.  As an example of what Xfree86 and KDE 3.x looks like on an Indy desktop, 
	take a look at the three screenshots below:</p>

      <title>(2004-02-06): Updated Install stages for SGI Indy, Indigo2, and Challenge S</title>
      <body>
	<p>It's taken over a month of tweaking, tinkering, and yelling at my SGI Machines, and the 
	Catalyst build system, but I've managed to finally produce some installation stages.  All the 
	stages are based off of a portage snapshot taken on Jan 31st, 2004, but only got finished today.</p>

	<p>The Stages can be found here for now:<br />

      <title>(2004-02-06): Updated Install stages for Cobalt systems</title>
      <body>
	<p>The original cobalt stages were built against a 20040113 snapshot of portage, but since newer stages
	have been made for the SGI systems on a 20040131 portage, I rebuilt the cobalt stages to bring them up 
	to date.</p>

	<p>The Stages can be found here for now:<br />

      <title>(2004-02-01): Install stages for Cobalt Microserver systems</title>
      <body>
	<p>Okay, a few people have been inquiring about this for quite some time, and I have good 
	news that the RaQ2 and Qube2 Cobalt models can run Gentoo.</p>

	<p>One of the primary hurdles that needed overcoming was the network driver (it was a bit 
	flaky in modern kernels). It'd randomly timeout/shutdown/etc.. after some measure of network 
	activity. Turns out this issue was not the tulip driver itself (As I had thought), but rather 
	the Galileo PCI chip (and its driver). There's a patch that fixes it now (credit goes to Peter 
	Horton), and I was finally able to get some gentoo stages that had been sitting on my RaQ2 
	off and uploaded.</p>

	<p>There's still the issue of the kernel size limitation, so 2.6 kernels are out of the 
	question for now. There's a bootloader being coded, but it requires re-flashing the cobalt-rom, 
	not something everyone is keen on doing, I'm sure.  There is also no install documentation, or
	a gentoo netboot for these machines</p>

	<p>More information and links can be found at the following forums thread:<br />
