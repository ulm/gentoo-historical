<p>
This guide is intended to show C programmers how to port programs
written on other architectures to the Alpha architecture. The
overview has some basic information that should be known when
porting any application to Alpha. The subsequent sections will have
example problems, explanations, and solutions. All of the code examples
compile and work without warnings on i386 systems, but fail or are
potentially unsafe on alpha.

You will see compile time warnings about casting between types of different

<title>Explanation of the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
When you store a value in a variable of one size and convert it to another
size, bits either get added or chopped from the original value. A lot of
programmers assume that integers and pointers are the same size and cast freely
between the two. While it works on x86 systems, it can cause problems on
systems where the size of an integer is different than the size of a pointer.
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of a cast to pointer from integer of different size. This
cast is dangerous because we are casting a 64 bit pointer to a 32 bit integer.
We effectively chop off the 32 most significant bits, then we try to access
the memory at that 64 bit address using only the 32 least significant bits.
This will cause a segfault unless your program is located in physical memory
between address <c>0x0000000000000000</c> and address
<c>0x00000000FFFFFFFF</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="cast to pointer from integer of different size">
int main(void) {
    /* Expected output: "Ice cream has no bones." */
    /* Actual   output: "Segmentation fault"      */

    int x = (int) "Ice cream has no bones.\n";
    printf((const char*)x);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Below is an example of a cast from pointer to integer of different size.
Usually this is done for pointer arithmetic. Most of the time the pointers
we use are relatively close to each other and they have a good position in
memory, so the program executes normally. However, problems occur when the
calculations require more than 32 bits. The example below would seg fault if
the <c>'!'</c> was located at <c>0x000000010000000e</c> and the array started
at <c>0x00000000FFFFFFFF</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="cast from pointer to integer of different size">
int main(void) {
    /* Expected output: "Banana Phone" */
    /* Actual   output: "Banana Phone" */

    char c[16], *ptr;

    strncpy(c,"Banana Phone\n!",16);

    ptr = strchr(c,'!');        /* remove '!' by putting */
    c[(int)ptr-(int)c]=0x00;    /* '\0' in its place   */

    printf("%s",c);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
When programming, don't try to be smart and do tricks with pointers. Always
use the appropriate type, and don't cast between pointer and non-pointer
types. Following that advice creates more portable code, and the code
produced is generally easier to read.
</p>

<pre caption="always use the appropriate storage class">
int main(void) {
    char *x = "Ice cream has no bones.\n";
    printf(x);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
When doing pointer arithmetic, you should avoid casting between pointer
and non-pointer types as much as possible.
</p>

<pre caption="avoid casting when doing pointer arithmetic">
int main(void) {
    char c[16], *ptr;

    strncpy(c,"Banana Phone\n!",16);

    ptr = strchr(c,'!');        /* remove '!' by putting */
    *(c+(ptr-c))=0x00;        /* '\0' in its place     */

    printf("%s",c);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<note>
The above example is used to demonstrate pointer arithmetic without casting.
Removing the <c>'!'</c> character can be done by <c>*ptr=0x00;</c> instead
of doing <c>*(c+(ptr-c))=0x00;</c>.

<title>Unaligned Accesses</title>

<section>
<title>Identifying the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
The kernel will log an <b>unaligned trap</b>.
</p>

<pre caption="error message in the kernel log">
Mar 14 22:07:25 [kernel] a.out(3572): unaligned trap at 0000000120000590: 0000000120010b52 2c 31
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Explanation of the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
On Alpha, all memory accesses have to be <b>naturally aligned</b>. For example,
the address of a 4 byte integer must be a multiple of 4. The address of an
8 byte (long) integer must be a multiple of 8. The compiler will do its
best to align variables automatically, but sometimes you can override this
by doing some pointer tricks or adding assembly language code.
</p>

<p>
When a program does an unaligned memory access, the CPU traps into the kernel.
The kernel then does an aligned access and returns the unaligned portion of
memory that the program requested. The program continues to function normally
as if nothing has happened.
</p>

<p>
Even though the program will work correctly with unaligned accesses, you
should try to remove as many unaligned accesses as possible because they
cause a performance hit.
</p>

<p>
The following example shows how to make an unaligned memory access by
manipulating pointers.
</p>

<pre caption="unaligned memory access">
int main(void) {
    /* Expected results: Nothing appended to the kernel log */

    /* Actual results: The following appended to the kernel log
     *    unaligned trap at 0000000120000590: 0000000120010b52 2c 31
     */

    short x[10];
    int  *y = (int*) (x+1);

    *y = 0;

    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
The first step in fixing unaligned traps is determining where the
unaligned access happens in our code. To do that we are going to use
the following tool.
</p>

<pre caption="unalign.c - unaligned access debugging tool">

<p>
Using this tool is very simple. Compile the code above. Then, compile your
program with debugging information via the <c>-g3</c> compiler flag. Finally,
execute <c>unalign</c> with the name of your program as an argument.

As with most programming problems, there are multiple solutions. In the

points to an aligned memory address.

<p>
In the second solution we use types with the same byte alignment to avoid
the possibility of an unaligned access.

<p>
When the Alpha architecture's floating point unit was first designed, the
designers traded performance for functionality. As a result, all Alpha systems
below <c>EV6</c> do not fully implement the IEEE floating point standard. For
those earlier systems, there is no hardware support for denormalized numbers or
exceptional IEEE values like not a number and positive/negative infinity. If
you wish to use those features, you must enable software assisted IEEE
floating point at compile time and have kernel support for software
completion enabled.
</p>

<pre caption="exceptional IEEE values">
int main(void) {
    /* Expected output: "x/y = inf"                */
    /* Actual   output: "Floating point exception" */

<section>
<title>Explanation of the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
Sometimes programmers don't think about Alpha when conditionally compiling
sections of code. They may make assumptions, or only consider a subset of
all architectures.
</p>

<p>
In the following example the programmer assumes that if the system compiling
the program is <c>i386</c>, then it is little endian. The programmer also
assumes that the only other system type that would compile this program is
<c>ppc</c> and therefore would be big endian.
</p>

<pre caption="forget about alpha when determining endianness">
int main(void) {
    /* Expected output: "3" (works on x86 and ppc) */
    /* Actual   output: "4" */

    int x;
    unsigned char y[4];
    memset(y,0,sizeof(unsigned char)*4);

    y[0]=0xff; y[1]=0x00;
    y[2]=0xff; y[4]=0x00;

    memcpy(&amp;x,y,4);

#ifdef __i386
    /* little endian */
    x = (x&amp;1) + 2;
#else /* __ppc */
    /* big endian */
    x = (x&amp;1) + 3;

    return 0;
}

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Finding a Solution</title>
<body>

<p>
When determining whether the system compiling your program has a particular
property (example, little endian vs. big endian), you should never use 
<c>__arch</c>. If you do, then to ensure portability you will have to
determine if the property exists or not for every architecture, and you will
have to add new architectures as they are created. Instead you should 
use preprocessor definitions, or a runtime check if the definitions are 
not available.

<title>Explanation of the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
Functions like <c>printf</c> can accept any number of arguments. The
arguments are stored on the stack. Generally, they are accessed by doing 
pointer arithmetic and casting. The direction in which you iterate over 
the remaining arguments varies depending on architecture / operating system.
On some systems you increment the pointer to reach the next parameter, 
on other systems you decrement the pointer to reach the next paramater.
Furthermore, there is no compile time storage size check, nor type 
checking.
</p>

<pre caption="variable length parameter list">

Since accessing parameters is so system dependent, we cannot easily 
write very portable code without the help of some preprocessor macros.
Fortunately, those preprocessor macros are already written for us.

<warn>
Being portable does not imply being safe. Even if you use the macros in 
<c>stdarg.h</c> you still have to be careful about sizes, types, and
the number of parameters. Variable length parameter lists should be used
only when absolutely needed.

<title>Failure to determine CPU Frequency</title>

<section>
<title>Identifying the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
A program that displays or uses the CPU frequency for some purpose will
fail at runtime.
</p>

<section>
<title>Explanation of the Problem</title>
<body>

<p>
There are some programs that determine the CPU frequency from 
<c>/proc/cpuinfo</c>. The format of this file is slightly different on 
Alpha. Below are example <c>/proc/cpuinfo</c> listings.
</p>

<p>
Above, in the amd64 example, you will notice that the CPU frequency is 
given on the <c>cpu MHz</c> line. Below, in the alpha example, you 
will notice that the CPU frequency is given on the <c>cycle frequency 
[Hz]</c> line.

<p>
conky is an advanced, highly configurable system monitor for X. The 
program can display your CPU frequency. Below is the <c>/proc/cpuinfo</c>
parser that comes with versions of conky prior to 1.4.1. It doesn't work 
correctly on alpha. It reports a CPU frequency of 0 MHz.

<p>
Unlike some of the other portability problems that this document discusses,
this problem is not language specific. Here is an example of the problem
in python.
</p>

<pre caption="/proc/cpuinfo parser written in python">
import re

def get_freq():
        r = re.compile('^cpu MHz\s+:\s+(\d+\.\d+)$', re.M)
        m = r.search( open('/proc/cpuinfo').read() )
        return float(m.group(1))
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Finding a Solution</title>
<body>

<p>
To solve the problem we make an exception for alpha by using the 
<c>__alpha</c> preprocessor definition. We also need to divide the value 
by 1000000 to get the CPU frequency in MHz.

The python fix is similar, just make an exception for alpha by using
<c>os.uname()[-1]</c> to determine the system architecture.
