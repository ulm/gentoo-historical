<title>Abstract</title>

<p>
The Alpha Arch Tester project is heavily based on the <uri
link="/proj/en/base/amd64/at/index.xml">AMD64 Arch Tester</uri>
project and the <uri link="/proj/en/base/ppc/AT/index.xml">PPC Arch Tester
project</uri>. The project is meant to help the Alpha Arch Team providing an
stable, secure and up to date Gentoo Linux port.
</p>

<p>
Being an Arch Tester is the first step to becoming a developer, however,
that does not mean every Arch Tester becomes a developer.
</p>

<p>
The Alpha Arch Team will eventually ask Alpha Arch Testers to officially
join the team as developers.

<title>Becoming an Alpha Arch Tester</title>
<section>
<title>Basic Requirements</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to become an Alpha Arch Tester there are some steps you have to
follow. And you also have to fulfil some requirements.
</p>

<p>
You should have Alpha hardware yourself. Being familiar with the Gentoo
development style and ways is also 'a must'. Being an Arch Tester also
requires having patience and being careful with testing.
</p>

<p>
Although it is not a requirement, having basic C programming skills is
good since arch testers are often asked to test patches or even patch
code.
</p>

<section>
<title>First Steps</title>
<body>

<p>
Before you become an Alpha Arch Tester we ask you to show you are a good
candidate for such a position. There are a number of ways to do that, we
normally recommend that you 'watch' the <mail
link="alpha@gentoo.org">alpha@gentoo.org</mail> user in <uri
link="https://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri> and help out testing and
fixing bugs.
</p>

<p>
Helping out in <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/">forums</uri> and <uri
link="/main/en/lists.xml">mailing lists</uri> is also good.
</p>

<p>
Once you feel you have shown you are a good candidate, you can ask us to
consider you as a new Alpha Arch Tester.
</p>

<p>
The last step is taking a very <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~klausman/alpha_at_quiz.txt">basic
quiz</uri> about Gentoo in general and the Alpha architecture. The quiz
has more instructions to follow once it's finished.

<title>Rights and tasks</title>
<section>
<title>What do I get for being an Alpha Arch Tester?</title>
<body>

<p>
You will be given access to the resources used and provided by the arch
team to its developers and arch testers.
</p>

<p>
Once you are accepted as an Alpha Arch Tester you will be added to the
<mail link="alpha@gentoo.org">alpha@gentoo.org</mail> alias; that way
you can easily track the development of the arch team.
</p>

<p>
Alpha Arch Testers will be covered by <uri
link="/proj/en/glep/glep-0041.html">GLEP 41</uri> if it ever gets
implemented. That means you will, officially, be part of the Gentoo
Project.
</p>

<section>
<title>What would you do as an Alpha Arch Tester</title>
<body>

<p>
Once you become an Alpha Arch Tester you will be helping the Alpha Arch
Team with keywording and general bug fixing duties.
</p>

<p>
Alpha Arch Testers will not deal with security bugs, toolchain packages,
nor <path>alpha/</path> profiles.
</p>

<p>
The Alpha Arch Team will trust your abilities to test packages. The
developer doing the final commit will be responsible for any
breakages that might happen.
</p>

<p>
The developer doing the final commit will add your name and email to
both the <path>ChangeLog</path> and the commit message. That way you are
given credit and we can keep track of your activity.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Leaving Alpha Arch Testers Project</title>
<section>
<title>How do I stop being an Alpha Arch Tester?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to leave the project, that's fine.
</p>

<p>
If you are inactive for a couple of months and we don't have any news
from you we will assume you will not come back in a while and will mark
you inactive, however you can join us again if you come back. If you
come back, and still want to belong to the project, you will not have to
go through the whole process.
</p>

<p>
Everybody makes mistakes so you won't be given the boot if you make some
mistakes. However, we ask you to do your job as good as possible, and if
you continuously make mistakes we might ask you to reconsider if you
want to belong to the project.
</p>

<p>
If you become an Alpha Gentoo Developer, you will not be an Alpha Arch
Tester anymore. However, being a Gentoo Developer and being an Alpha
Arch Tester is perfect. Though we will probably ask you to join the Team
in such situation.
