  <description>
    Maintenance of the profile of packages the PPC team calls 'stable'.

  <longdescription><p>
    The transition from tested to stable meta-date is this team's
    responsability. If you want to have something listed as stable or report a
    bug for a stable package, these people are the ones to contact. If you have
    ambitions to become a Gentoo developer, this might be the ideal place to
    start.

    <description>Mask ebuild stable for PPC</description>
    <longdescription><p>
      To be more comfortable to users, tested ebuilds on PPC should be masked
      stable after some time running without problems.  This is a progress in
      work and will never stop.
