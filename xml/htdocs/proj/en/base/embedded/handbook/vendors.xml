<title>Hardware Donations</title>
<body>

<p>
Obviously the first barrier to supporting something is hardware.  It's hard to
develop for something without hardware to actually test on.  There are
generally two classes of machines: (1) generic hardware development platforms
and (2) specific device platforms.  The generic platforms can be thought of as
"desktopish" machines where the system is self hosting, has large local storage
(i.e. a harddisk, not flash), and network connectivity.  These platforms are
useful in the sense of getting software to build specifically for that
architecture.  The device platforms are things like a PDA or a cell phone.
The target of the development is to produce a firmware image which can be used
on just the one device.

If you have hardware to spare, feel free to contact the

home for your donation.  Thanks!
