<p>
First off, please review the <uri link="communication.xml">Gentoo Embedded
communication channels</uri> and join as needed.  Please do not start with
e-mailing specific developers.
</p>

<p>
Below we outline the many different aspects which could use your help.
Contribute whatever and whenever you can!

<title>Arch Testers</title>
<body>
<p>
Often times considered a mighty boring job, it is unfortunately quite critical
to the smooth running of a port.  It involves testing new packages for
stabilization or new packages that have not yet been tested on the particular
architecture.  Simply select your favorite embedded architecture
(arm, m68k, mips, ppc, sh) and start watching the alias on the Gentoo Bugzilla.
When a bug opens requesting stabilization or arch testing, test the package in
question on your setup and report back to the bug on how things go.  If you
want to contribute more, sign up to be a developer yourself for the
architecture in question and just start committing fixes yourself! :)  See
our <uri link="/proj/en/devrel/">Gentoo Developer Relations page</uri> for
more information.

<title>Release Engineers</title>
<body>
<p>
Every release of Gentoo should see updated stages for people to use as a base
when creating a new native install.  Each architecture (arm, m68k, sh) needs a
dedicated person to go through the process of building these stages and
tracking down/fixing failures as they come up.

<body>
<p>
Got a crazy new embedded device and you want to put Gentoo on it?  Then do it!
Once you've gone through the steps, put together a little bit of information on
it and get it integrated into the Gentoo Embedded Handbook.  Finally, start
making little firmware images for others to drop into their system so they can
get a head start on the process.

<title>Answer Questions</title>
<body>
<p>
Have general knowledge and like to help people?  Great!  We get questions every
day in our mailing lists/irc channels/etc... which require people to simply
watch and answer as they can.  Maybe you'll learn a thing or two yourself!

<title>Documentation</title>
<body>
<p>
One of Gentoo's strong points is its documentation.  However, this stuff
doesn't write itself, so we need people familiar with Gentoo's simple
<uri link="/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">GuideXML documentation format</uri> to help
maintain and expand the Gentoo Embedded documentation.
