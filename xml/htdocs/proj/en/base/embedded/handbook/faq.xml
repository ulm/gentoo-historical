<title>I get "configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"</title>
<body>
<p>
This is a generic error and can be caused by just about anything.  The test is
pretty simple: can the requested compiler create an executable?  However, this
relies on many things being correct: the toolchain itself being completely
sane, the compiler and compiler flags being appropriate, your environment set
up properly, etc...  The only way to find out the real source of the problem is
to open up the generated <path>config.log</path> file and scroll down to where
this test is run and see what exactly the error message is that the toolchain
is spitting out.
