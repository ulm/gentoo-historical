<description>
  Embedded Gentoo brings the flexibity of Gentoo to embedded systems.
</description>

<longdescription>
  This project manages embedded system support in Gentoo.  The project is
  responsible for overseeing the build infrastructure for creating images
  to be installed onto embedded systems.  Also included is the support of
  specific types of embedded systems, and development tools.
</longdescription>

<goals>
  The intention of the project is to make Gentoo viable for embedded systems.
  This includes creating a system for cross compiling and building the image
  for an embedded system on a Gentoo workstation.  The base install image
  should be minimal, with different libc options.  Building on this base,
  the system can be customized for the particular system.

<p>
  To participate in the Embedded Gentoo project first join the mailing list at
  <i>gentoo-embedded@gentoo.org</i>. Then ask if there are plans to support
  something that you are interested in, propose a new subproject that you are
  interested in or choose one of the planned subprojects to work on. You may talk
  to the developers and users in the IRC channel <i>#gentoo-embedded</i> on
  <i>irc.freenode.net</i> for more information or just to chat about the project
  or any subprojects. If you don&#39;t have the ability to actively help by
  contributing work we will always need testers to maintain the stability of
  the project. All development, testing, and productive comments and
  feedback will be greatly appreciated.
