	<title>About The Gentoo/AMD64 Project</title>
<body>
<p>
The Gentoo/AMD64 Project works to make Gentoo the most up to date, fast, and robust AMD64 Linux distribution available. Part of this involves coming up with innovative ways to integrate a 32-bit compatibility layer into our native 64-bit userland without tainting or interleaving the current environment. Our main goal is to provide a stable production-quality release targeted at servers which will be the core use of the Opteron processors.
