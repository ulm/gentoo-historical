*  Profiles

Necessary profiles are

    -   default-amd64-2004.2			(kugelfang, done)

    -   gcc34-amd64-2004.2			(lv, in progress)

*  Stable tree

    -   Syncing amd64 and x86 stable tree	(all devs, ongoing)
	http://amd64.gentoo.org/imlate.txt

	# I will update as neccessary<malc>
	# (note for 2004.3, at least one of us should plan to have stable
	# chroot for this activity... doing it on gcc3.4 ~unstable is a little
	# crazy...)

    -   Marking ebuilds stable that are		(all devs, in progrress)
	necessary on amd64.
	

*  Stagebuilding

    -   Portage Snapshot			(jhuebel, done)
	# portage snapshot is out in my devspace if anyone wants to
	# build odd-ball stages or custom LiveCDs.

    -   Stagebuilding + LiveCD building		(jhuebel, in progress)
    	# 20040626 stages and LiveCD available in my devspace at:
	# http://dev.gentoo.org/~jhuebel/2004.2/

    -   Testing					(all, in progress)
	# user testing of -test2 will start on July 1st.

   complete and committed to CVS.

 - July 1 - (jhuebel) - 2004.2 Minimal LiveCD will be made available
   through my devspace for testing.
 
 - July 9 - (jhuebel) - final 2004.2 release candidate LiveCDs will be made
   available through to my devspace.  One last quick round of testing
   before the LiveCDs are given the seal of approval.
