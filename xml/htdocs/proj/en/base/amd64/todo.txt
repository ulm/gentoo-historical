TODO List for 2004.2:

*  Profiles

Necessary profiles are

    -   default-amd64-2004.2			(kugelfang, wait for check)
	# Jhuebel said he wants to have a look
	# at it. As soon as he approves, it can
	# be marked as "done". <kugelfang>

    -   gcc34-amd64-2004.2			(lv, in progress)

*  Stable tree

We have to do changes to the tree in the time
_before_ the Portage Snapshot will be taken.
Scheduled for

    -   Syncing amd64 and x86 stable tree	(malc, in progress)
	# Tamran: Can you help here ? Malc can
	# probaby put it up his devspace and
	# add the link here ? <kugelfang>

    -   Marking ebuilds stable that are		(all, in progrress)
	necessary on amd64.
	

*  Stagebuilding

    -   Portage Snapshot			(jhuebel, testing only)
    	# final 2004.2 snapshot will be made on June 25th. If it isn't
	# stable by then, too bad. <jhuebel>

    -   Stagebuilding + LiveCD building		(jhuebel, in progress)
    	# initial stages and LiveCD available in my devspace at:
	# http://dev.gentoo.org/~jhuebel/2004.2/

    -   Testing					(all, in progress)
    	# users will be able to do more extensive testing after the
	# portage freeze. The portage snapshot I'm using
	# is pretty stale, since it was made on 20040602.
    
*  Schedule

 - June 14 to 25 - (malc) - malc's first assignment will be marking
   eligible packages as stable in preparation for 2004.2.

 - 23:59, June 24 - (malc) - All packages planned for the LiveCD and GRP
   should be marked stable by this date.
 
 - June 25 - (Lv) - Default and gcc34 profiles for 2004.2 should be
   complete and committed to CVS.

 - June 25 - (jhuebel) - 2004.2 PORTAGE FREEZE. All portage updates after
   this date will be post-2004.2, barring any serious issues.  Portage
   snapshot included on the LiveCDs will be made on this day.
 
 - June 26 - (jhuebel) - final 2004.2 stages completed. Users can start
   helping with testing at this point by bootstrapping a 64-bit chroot.
 
 - June 26 - (jhuebel) - 2004.2 Minimal LiveCD will be made available
   through my devspace for initial testing.
 
 - July 2 - (jhuebel) - first 2004.2 release candidate LiveCDs will be
   made available through my devspace. GRP should also be complete.
 
 - July 9 - (jhuebel) - final 2004.2 release candidate LiveCDs will be made
   available through to my devspace.  One last quick round of testing
   before the LiveCDs are given the seal of approval.

# These have been pushed back a few days.  Kugelfang is working on the 2004.2
# profile, so I won't be making the final snapshot until the end of this week.
# In particular, I'm referring to the portage freeze. It will now happen on
# June 25th.  So basically, all dates listed here have been pushed forward 4
# days. <jhuebel>

# Dates changed. <kugelfang>
