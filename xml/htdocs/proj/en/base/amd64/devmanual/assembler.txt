Assembler Optimisation
======================

Modern x86 processors support special instruction sets like ``mmx``, ``sse``,
``SSE2`` and ``3DNow!``. AMD64 also provides support for them, but x86 assembler
is incompatible to amd64 assembler. There are lots of packages that provide
support through use flags for these instruction sets. Originally, the use flags
were introduced to keep support for older processors like Pentium I that can't
handle such code. Currently, all AMD64 support the same combination of extended
instruction sets, so there is no reason to make use of the mentioned use flags.
That's why these use flags are hard-masked in all AMD64-profiles. This doesn't
mean we don't support the extensions themselves, instead, we hard-enable them.

The following use flags are masked on AMD64:

* mmx
* mmx2
* sse
* sse2
* 3dnow
* 3dnowext
