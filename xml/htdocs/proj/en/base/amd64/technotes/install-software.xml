	<title>Available Kernels</title>
<subsection>
	<title>On The LiveCD</title>
<body>
<p>
As of 2004.3, there is one kernel available on the LiveCD to boot from.  That kernel is called <c>gentoo</c> and is an SMP kernel.  Non-SMP machines can still use this kernel.
</p>
</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
	<title>Using The Right Kernel Sources</title>
<body>
<impo>Use <path>sys-kernel/gentoo-dev-sources</path> line of kernels! It
has AMD64-specific patches, as well as additional enhancements. We will not be
able to support you if you use another source.</impo>

	<title>Building A Kernel For An eMachine Laptop</title>
<body>
<p>
Prior to 2004.3, when configuring the kernel for use on an eMachines Mobile Athlon64 laptop,  you <e>must</e> compile USB support into the kernel.  Otherwise, you will receive errors about an "unknown keypress' from <path>atkbd.c</path>. Disabling USB support does not work.
</p>
<p>
Reports on how well 2004.3 works for eMachines laptops should be submitted through bugs.gentoo.org.

	<title>2.4.x Kernel Officially Deprecated</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>The 2.4.x kernel line is officially deprecated for AMD64.</b> As of 2.4.23-pre7, devfs
has been disabled (hardcoded in kernel), stating memory corruption as the
reason.  We at Gentoo have not experienced any such problems, but 2.4 is not a
good solution on Gentoo without devfs.

	<title>gcc 3.3 Officially Deprecated</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>gcc 3.3 is officially deprecated for AMD64, as of the 2004.3 release.</b> All 2004.3
release media is now based on gcc 3.4.x.

<section><title>Kernel Panics At Boot</title>
<body>
<p>
If you're having kernel panics on boot, please try passing <c>idle=poll</c> as a
boot option. There is a problem with many BIOS's out there and seems to mainly
affect VIA chipset motherboards. You should only try passing that boot option
<e>after</e> updating to the latest BIOS available by your motherboard
manufacturer. You may also be able to solve this by disabling Legacy USB support
in your BIOS. If you are forced to use the <c>idle=poll</c> option, please
contact your motherboard manufacturer/BIOS vendor for a fix for the CPU Errata
#93.
</p>
<p>
For a little more info on this topic, see these mailing list archives:

	<li><uri>http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-amd64/2003-Dec/0034.html</uri></li>
</ul>
<p>
And you can see it's not a Gentoo-specific problem!

<section><title>Filesystem Support</title>
<body>
<p>
We strongly recommend sticking with ext2/3 for now. We have had random reported
problems with reiserfs on AMD64 and have heard of major problems with running
JFS on 64-bit systems (which definately seems odd considering it was designed
for 64-bit systems initially).

<section><title>The Bootloader: Compiling grub</title>
<body>
<p>
Grub will not build in a pure 64-bit environment.  It will only compile using a multilib
gcc.  2004.3 includes multilib support by default.  If you choose to remove multilib support
from gcc, then you most use <c>grub-static</c>.  <c>grub-static</c> can be installed using the
following commands:
</p>
<pre>
emerge grub-static
cp -Rpv /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/* /boot/grub
</pre>

<section><title>Some Packages Are Still Masked</title>
<body>
<p>
Some packages which are unmasked on other architectures are still masked on
AMD64. This doesn't mean that they don't work. It simply means that no Gentoo
developer has been able to test them on an AMD64 machine. Please test masked
applications and <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">submit a bug report</uri>
letting the developers know whether a package works or not.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section><title>Packages That Don't Work</title>
<body>
<p>
Don't currently work: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firebird (the database, NOT the browser)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Things that won't work in 64-bit mode, but WILL work in 32-bit mode (assuming
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs and friends are installed):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any program that uses 32-bit dlls from windows (such as mplayer/xine support
	for some proprietary formats)</li>
	<li>Any programs that require 32-bit assembly</li>
</ul>

<section><title>Java Support</title>
<body>
<p>
Blackdown released a native 64-bit Java for Linux on AMD64. It is a
release candidate so do not expect it to be perfect. It is in portage as
<path>blackdown-jdk-1.4.2</path> and <path>blackdown-jre-1.4.2</path>.
</p>
<p>
Some people have noted that the 64-bit Java VM is slower than the 32-bit Java
VM. Juergen Kreileder of Blackdown was kind enough to respond:
</p>
<pre>
Actually the 64-bit VM is faster than the 32-bit VM in allmost all
benchmarks.

The difference they see is more likely to come from the different
VMs:
The i386 version comes with the HotSpot Client VM and the HotSpot
Server VM, the Client VM gets used by default.  The AMD64 version
only comes with the Server VM, the Client VM has not been ported yet.

In general the Server VM is the faster VM.  Its compiler does more
optimizations and is more aggressive than the Client VM's compiler.
It usually generates much better code.
The downside is that doing this optimizations takes CPU time and
memory.  Because of this running GUI code in the Client VM often
is faster (at least initially) than running it in the Server VM.

In other words: It's not fair to compare i386-client with
AMD64-server.  You have to compare i386-server (ie. "java -server
...") with AMD64-server.
</pre>
<p>
Also, he answered a question about a potential timeline that the client VM
might be accomplished in:
</p>
<pre>
It won't be in the final 1.4.2 release.  It's unlikely for 1.5.0 (both
Sun and Blackdown), Sun is happy with the Server VM port and not
really interested in getting the Client VM ported (the other 64-bit
VMs, for IA64 &amp; SPARC64, are Server VM-only too).  And it's just too
much work (I'd estimate 10-13 man weeks) to do it without payment.
</pre>
<p>
So if you're going to run benchmarks, to be fair, run java -server on both
arches, and don't expect the client vm to be done anytime too soon. ;-)
</p>
<p>
Once you have java installed, the following symlink fix is required to 
make it work with mozilla (and possibly konqueror):
</p>
<pre>
/usr/lib/nsbrowser/plugins/libjavaplugin_oji.so -> /opt/blackdown-jdk-1.4.2_rc1/jre/plugin/amd64/mozilla/libjavaplugin_oji.so
</pre>

<section><title>Installing OpenOffice</title>
<body>
<p>
OpenOffice is currently only available in 32-bit binary form, since OpenOffice 1.1.x will not compile on amd64. To install OpenOffice, emerge the <path>app-office/openoffice-bin</path> package.
</p>
<note>Don't even consider trying to get OpenOffice to compile from source. It is an effort in futility and will only lead to many sleepless nights.</note>

<section><title>Properly Setting CFLAGS</title>
<body>
<p>
Unlike gcc 3.3, gcc 3.4 requires that you set -march.  The most conservative (and supported)
CFLAGS can be set as show below:
</p>
<pre caption="gcc-3.4 CFLAGS">
...
CFLAGS="-march=k8 -O2 -pipe"
...
</pre>
<note>
<c>-march=k8</c> equals <c>-march=athlon64</c> equals <c>-march=opteron</c>.
</note>
<p>
There used to be issues with the lack of <c>-fPIC</c> being specified when
building shared objects, the reasoning is in this mailing list post: 
 <uri link="http://www.x86-64.org/lists/discuss/msg02621.html">Porting to
Hammer</uri> -- scan down to "Shared libraries must be compiled with -fPIC". If
you find any packages that complain about needing <c>-fPIC</c> to run/link
properly, please notify us immediately, as we need to update that package.
Please do not specify <c>-fPIC</c> in your global CFLAGS as that is not an
acceptable solution and just a workaround.
</p>
<p>
Please do not add <c>-m32</c> to your USE flags, as you do not want to compile
the system in 32-bit mode, and by default Gentoo does not support compiling
32-bit binaries. Use of the <c>-m64</c> flag is irrelevant as the compiler
defaults to 64-bit mode and could have negative effects on code that may supply
<c>-m32</c> internally to compile 32-bit assembly (such as newer releases of
grub will do).
</p>
<warn>Don't use <c>-Os</c>. This has been known to prevent parts of KDE 3.2.0 from compiling.</warn>
</body>
</section>
 
<section><title>USE Flags That Are Ignored</title>
<body>
<p>
The <c>mmx</c>, <c>3dnow</c>, <c>sse</c> and <c>sse2</c> USE flags are ignored
on AMD64, since all AMD64 processors support those instruction sets. The are
ignored because they enable 32bit assembly optimisation for some packages.
