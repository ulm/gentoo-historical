<longname>Gentoo/AMD64 Project</longname>

<description>
The Gentoo/AMD64 Project is devoted to providing a stable release
of Gentoo for the AMD64 and EM64T processor families
</description>

<longdescription>

<p>The Gentoo/AMD64 Project works to make Gentoo the most up to date,
fast, robust AMD64 Linux distribution available.  Part of
this involves coming up with innovative ways to integrate a 32bit
compatibility layer into our native 64bit userland without tainting
or interleaving the current environment. Our main goal is to
provide a stable production-quality release targeted at servers
which will be the core use of the Opteron processors.</p>

<p>The AMD line of 64-bit extended processors were released well ahead of 
Intel's offering. Therefore, for historical reasons the arch keyword for all 
x86-64 compatible architectures is amd64. </p>

<p>Bugs are tracked and resolved from the <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo bug tracker</uri> and correspondence is
maintained on the gentoo-amd64 mailing list. Send a blank email to
<uri link="mailto:gentoo-amd64-subscribe@gentoo.org">gentoo-amd64-subscribe@gentoo.org</uri>
to participate.</p>

<goals>

<p>The goal of the Gentoo AMD64 development project is to guarantee that
AMD64-ready packages built using Gentoo meta-data are up to date.  By
continuously enhancing the meta-data, we provide the AMD64 user with the
famous Gentoo community feeling, performance, flexibility, and consistency.  The
meta-distribution notion allows for a user to to be as bleeding edge as
he/she wants:</p>

<p>Gentoo is unique because of its interpretation of the Meta-Distribution
notion: all architectures share the same 'generic' meta-data (information
about how to build packages - how to build a distribution). The AMD64
developers are responsible for building and testing packages using this
meta-data.  The meta-data gets marked 'tested' or 'stable' afterwards,
depending on the building and testing experience. Our users can use (but
don't have to use) this information to build a system that suits their
needs.</p>

</goals>

<extraproject name="Release Engineering" lead="kugelfang">

<p>Development and maintenance of the Gentoo/AMD64 LiveCDs, the
installation stages and the related development tools. (Catalyst and Genkernel)</p>

<p>The Release Engineering team is crosses architecture boundaries while trying
to develop generic multi-architecture and multi-platform release media.</p>

</extraproject>

<extraproject name="Stable profile" lead="blubb">

<p>Maintenance of the profile of packages the AMD64 team calls 'stable'. The
transition from tested to stable meta-date is this team's responsibility. If
you want to have something listed as stable or report a bug for a stable
package, these people are the ones to contact. If you have ambitions to
become a Gentoo developer, this might be the ideal place to start.</p>

</extraproject>

<extraproject name="Documentation" lead="slarti">

<p>Updating and creating documentation for the Gentoo/AMD64 team
especially the <uri link="/proj/en/base/amd64/technotes/index.xml">Gentoo/AMD64
Installation Technotes</uri>. The
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/">Gentoo Handbook</uri>
should be the "official" installation guide.</p>

</extraproject>

<extraproject name="Gentoo/AMD64 Arch Testers" lead="hparker">
<p>Responsible for responding to all test requests in a timely manner
including keywording, security, marking packages stable, requests from
devs on irc, ensuring that the application works, as well as check that
the ebuild doesn't contain any glaring errors.  Arch Testers must keep
their system up to date, use reasonable CFLAGS, and keep with the
current profile. If you want to become an arch tester
<uri link="/proj/en/base/amd64/tests/index.xml">here</uri> would be a good place to start.</p>
</extraproject>

<extraproject name="Emul Packages" lead="herbs">
<p>The Emul subproject is concerned with the management of the 32 bit
emulation packages we provide as a convenience to multilib users. More
information is available on the <uri link="/proj/en/base/amd64/emul/index.xml">Emul
subproject page</uri>.</p>

<p>Can you make computers do amazing things? Are you excited about
exploring areas of computing never explored before? We are continuously
looking for volunteers willing to spend some of their free time on this
project. In return for your work, you get the respect of the AMD64
community.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping, but don't have a niche that you are
interested in filling, you can always look through <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>. There are many many
bugs waiting to be found and fixed and many enhancements looking to find
someone to code them. Figure out a fix, implement it, test it, and then
keep trying to make the patch smaller. Post it for review on <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, and keep working on
it. If it seems ignored, make a new comment in the bug and/or mention it
in #gentoo-amd64.</p>
