  <longname>Gentoo Linux AMD64 (x86_64) Development</longname>

  <description>
    The AMD64 (x86_64) Development Project is devoted to providing a stable production-quality
    release of 64bit Gentoo for the Opteron/Athlon64 processor by AMD.
  </description>

  <longdescription>

    <p>The Gentoo/AMD64 Project works to make Gentoo the most up to date,
    fast, and robust AMD64 Linux distribution available.  Part of
    this involves coming up with innovative ways to integrate a 32bit
    compatibility layer into our native 64bit userland without tainting
    or interleaving the current environment. Our main goal is to
    provide a stable production-quality release targeted at servers
    which will be the core use of the Opteron processors.</p>

    <p>Bugs are tracked and resolved from the <uri
    link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo bug tracker</uri> and correspondence is
    maintained on the gentoo-amd64 mailing list. Send a blank email to
	gentoo-amd64-subscribe@gentoo.org to participate.</p>

  <goals>

    <p>The goal of the Gentoo AMD64 development project is to guarantee that
    AMD64-ready packages built using Gentoo meta-data are up to date.  By
    continuously enhancing the meta-data, we provide the AMD64 user with the
    famous Gentoo community feeling, performance, flexibility, and consistency.  The
    meta-distribution notion allows for a user to to be as bleeding edge as
    he/she wants:</p>

    <p>Gentoo is unique because of its interpretation of the Meta-Distribution
    notion: all architectures share the same 'generic' meta-data (information
    about how to build packages - how to build a distribution). The AMD64
    developers are responsible for building and testing packages using this
    meta-data.  The meta-data gets marked 'tested' or 'stable' afterwards,
    depending on the building and testing experience. Our users can use (but
    don't have to use) this information to build a system that suits their
    needs.</p>

  </goals>

  <extraproject name="LiveCD/DVD" lead="brad_mssw">

    <p>The development and maintenance of LiveCD related tools. A livecd is a
    bootable wrapper around a live gentoo environment. A live gentoo environment
    is applied meta-data. This project gives people an opportunity to build and
    create their own bootable Gentoo LiveCD or LiveDVD. A liveCD/DVD primary
    purpose is to showcase what a concrete realisation of the meta-data will
    look like. Often specialized livecds are build; automated distributed cross
    compile no livecds, livecds that allow people working on AMD64 hardware
    development to write and test drivers without having to install...</p>

    <p>The livecd project works closely together with other architectures,
    developing a generic multi-architecture and multi-platform liveCD/DVD
    building tool.</p>

  </extraproject>

  <extraproject name="Stages" lead="brad_mssw">

    <p>The development and maintenance of 'stage' tarballs. A stage tarball is a
    live environment, packed and compressed into a Unix (GNU) tarball. A live
    environment is applied meta-data. (some packages forming a concrete Gentoo
    system).</p>

    <p>The Stages project works closely together with other architectures,
    developing a generic multi-architecture and multi-platform live environment
    building tool.</p>

  </extraproject>

  <extraproject name="Stable-profile" lead="brad_mssw">

    <p>Maintenance of the profile of packages the AMD64 team calls 'stable'. The
    transition from tested to stable meta-date is this team's responsibility. If
    you want to have something listed as stable or report a bug for a stable
    package, these people are the ones to contact. If you have ambitions to
    become a Gentoo developer, this might be the ideal place to start.</p>

  </extraproject>

  <extraproject name="Documentation" lead="brad_mssw">

    <p>Updating and Creating documentation for the Gentoo/AMD64 team especially
    the <uri
    link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~brad_mssw/amd64-tech-notes.html">AMD64 Tech
    Notes</uri>.</p>

    <p>The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/">Gentoo
    Handbook</uri> should be the "official" installation guide.</p>

  </extraproject>

  <extraproject name="Kernels" lead="brad_mssw">

    <p>Responsible for creating and maintaining AMD64 kernels. This includes
    creating and maintaining the kernel configuration for use on the
    LiveCD/DVDs. The current AMD64 kernel is gentoo-dev-sources and is
    maintained by brad_mssw so is guaranteed to work and be optimized
    for AMD64</p>

        <p>Can you make computers do amazing things? Are you excited about
        exploring areas of computing never explored before? We are continuously
        looking for volunteers willing to spend some of their free time on this
        project. In return for your work, you get the respect of the AMD64
        community.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in helping, but don't have a niche that you are
        interested in filling, you can always look through <uri
        link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>. There are many many
        bugs waiting to be found and fixed and many enhancements looking to find
        someone to code them. Figure out a fix, implement it, test it, and then
        keep trying to make the patch smaller. Post it for review on <uri
        link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, and keep working on
        it. If it seems ignored, make a new comment in the bug and/or mention it
        in #gentoo-amd64.</p>
