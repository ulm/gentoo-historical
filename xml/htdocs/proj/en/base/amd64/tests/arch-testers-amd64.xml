<title>AMD64 Arch Testers Information</title>

<body>
<p>
Gentoo/AMD64 will maintain a pool of "Arch Testers" hence forth referred to
AT's.  One or more AMD64 Developers will take the responsiblity of 
managing the AT group.  ATs will be included on the amd64@gentoo.org alias, so 
they can be informed of all bug activity. The current AT head is Mike 
Doty. Any problems/suggestions/flames should be directed at him.
</p>

<p>
ATs will be responsible for responding to all test requests in a timely
manner (keywording, security, marking stable, requests from devs on irc,
etc...) and ensuring that the application works, as well as check that the
ebuild doesn't contain any glaring errors. ATs must keep their system up to
date, use reasonable CFLAGS, and keep with the current profile.  When marking
a bug as tested all ATs will use the keyword "TESTED" in bugzilla (in the
"keywords" field)
</p>

<p>
Gentoo/AMD64 developers will be able to take ATs word at their own discretion.
Ultimatly, commiting the requested changes will be the dev's responsibility .  Feel free to ask for
more than one tester if you feel the bug warrants it.
</p>

<p>
Prospective AT's will have to pass the ebuild quiz, currently <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/ebuild-quiz.txt">here.</uri>

Additionally, All quizes should be submitted to kingtaco@gentoo.org and CC'd to hparker@homershut.net
</p>

<p>
A note about arch testers "status": Gentoo/AMD64 Arch Testers are not official
Gentoo developers.  They are, however, a recognized part of the Gentoo/AMD64 arch
team.  I ask that all AT's keep this in mind when selecting email signatures or
other forms of communication.
</p>
