<title>Marking Stable:  When and How?</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/amd64/imlate.txt">imlate</uri> file lists packages where
the stable on amd64 is lagging behind the stable on x86.  It's useful to have people systematically
testing these packages, to help keep amd64 as up-to-date as possible.  These guidelines are
specifically aimed at AMD64-Testers (ATs) doing this testing.
</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, check to see if the newest version of the package is ~amd64.  If it's not, then
test it for ~amd64, and, if it passes, open a bug asking that it be marked ~amd64, and mark the bug
TESTED. </li>

<li>If the package is already ~amd64, then
	<ul>
	<li>If testing will take some time, start testing now, regardless of the eligiblity times below.</li>
	<li>Check to see when it was marked ~amd64.  There should be a comment in the ChangeLog for the package, but if there isn't, use the viewcvs on www.gentoo.org to look for the change in the ebuild that marked it ~amd64.  If that was less than 30 days ago, move on to another package, as it's not eligible for stable.</li>
	<li>Check for bugs on that version of the package.  If there have been open amd64 bugs in the last 30 days, move on to another package, it's not eligible for stable.</li>
	<li>If it has been bug-free for 30 days on amd64, test it <b>thoroughly</b>.  Really test it hard.  If you sign off that it's stable, it had <b>better</b> be stable.</li>
	<li>If you are convinced that the package is stable, and it meets the stability requirements (&gt;=30 days in testing and &gt;=30 days with no open amd64 bugs), open a bug (if none exists) with the subject "&lt;catagory&gt;/&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt; is stable on amd64", include the output of emerge info on your testing machine, and keyword the bug STABLE.  Assign the bug directly to amd64@gentoo.org to avoid more work for the poor wranglers.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
