<title>Arch Testers</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Gentoo/AMD64 will maintain a pool of "Arch Testers", henceforth referred to as ATs.
One or more AMD64 Developers will take responsibility for management of the AT group.
This management will include recruitment and assessment of new members, provision of
assistance and support to current members, and removal of retired/inactive persons.
All members will be included on the 'amd64@gentoo.org' alias, so they are advised of
bug activity and package testing requests in a timely fashion.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo/AMD64 Developers will be able to take any ATs testing outcome at their own discretion.
Ultimately, the responsibility for any committed package lies with the developer, and it is 
perfectly acceptable for a developer to request multiple ATs if they feel the bug warrants it.
</p>

<p>
Any and all problems, questions, applications and flames should be directed at those
classfied as 'Lead AT' in the list. In the case of applications, <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/ebuild-quiz.txt">quizzes</uri> should be
sent to <b>all</b> Lead ATs and CC'd to <mail link="kingtaco@gentoo.org">Mike Doty</mail>.

<title>Requirements</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Prospective ATs will be required to pass a quiz, currently located <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/ebuild-quiz.txt">here</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Collective responsibility for responding to all AMD64 test requests in a quick and
professional manner lies with the AT pool. Such requests will include keywording,
security, marking packages stable and requests from Developers on IRC. There is an
expectation that this testing will highlight glaring errors and ensure the ebuild
compiles and runs with no issues on the majority of systems. It is therefore required
that all ATs keep their systems up to date, within the current profile and implement
reasonable CFLAGS.
</p>

<p>
A note about the "status" of ATs:- Gentoo/AMD64 Arch Testers are not official developers.
They are a recognized part of the Gentoo/AMD64 architecture team, and we ask that this
is kept in mind when selecting signatures or participating in communication.
