<p>
  With Sony's recent introduction of the PS3, you can now run Linux on it as well as use it as a gaming console.  
    The PS3 is based on a Cell processor and therefore can run most of the ppc64 64ul or 32ul binaries without change.  As of now, the kernel does differ.
</p>
 <p>
  This project page is commited to Linux running on the PS3.  Here you will find all kinds of information
  related to Gentoo for the PS3, Cell processors, toolchains, and the Gentoo LiveCD for PS3 and PowerMacs.
  </p>

  If you are curious about the project, please join us on #gentoo-ppc64 on irc.freenode.net.

<p>The latest Livecd is very close to working.  Join us on IRC for the latest.  To wet your appetite, check out nickthecook's i<uri link="http://group18.hopto.org/img/gentoo-livecd4.jpg">snapshot</uri> of the livecd working.  Notice the full gnome desktop.  You can also see a hi-res screen shot of the gnome-desktop i<uri link="beta.jpg">here</uri>.</p>
<p>With the right equipment and a little hack (soon), the PS3 should boot into high resolution and include among other things:

<ul>
<li> Full gnome desktop 2.16.x</li>
<li> Sound support with audacious and rythmbox </li>
<li> Firefox 2 and thunderbird, evolution, epihany, seamonkey </li>
</ul>
