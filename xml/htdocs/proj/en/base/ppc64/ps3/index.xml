<p>
  With Sony's recent introduction of the PS3, you can now run Linux on it as well as use it as a gaming console.  
    The PS3 is based on a Cell processor and therefore can run most of the ppc64 64ul or 32ul binaries without change.  As of now, the kernel does differ.
</p>
 <p>
  This project page is commited to Linux running on the PS3.  Here you will find all kinds of information
  related to Gentoo for the PS3, Cell processors, toolchains, and the Gentoo LiveCD for PS3 and PowerMacs.
  </p>

  If you are curious about the project, please join us on #gentoo-ppc64 on irc.freenode.net.
