<p>
  With Sony's recent introduction of the PS3, you can now run Linux on it as well as use it as a gaming console.  
    The PS3 is based on a Cell processor and therefore can run most of the ppc64 64ul or 32ul binaries without change.  As of now, the kernel does differ.
</p>
 <p>
  This project page is commited to Linux running on the PS3.  Here you will find all kinds of information
  related to Gentoo for the PS3, Cell processors, toolchains, and the Gentoo LiveCD for PS3 and PowerMacs.
  </p>

  If you are curious about the project, please join us on #gentoo-ppc64 on irc.freenode.net.

<p>We have now released a beta LiveCD for PPC64, which supports PS3s and Apple PowerMac G5s.  It is available on the Gentoo mirrors under experimental/ppc64/livecd.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what a livecd is, check out the hi-res <uri link="beta.jpg">screen shot</uri> from Ranger. In addition to a full Gnome desktop, it contains:
<ul>
<li>Firefox-2x (Bon Echo)</li>
<li>Audacious</li>
<li>Xchat</li>
<li>Gaim</li>
<li>Evolution</li>
<li>Gimp-2</li>
</ul>
<note>We are currently having compilation problems with the mozilla products.  Once these compilation problems are sorted out, we will include Thunderbird.  As of now, we are including Firefox-2 with an uncommitted patch.</note>
</p>
<p>For a full list of packages included on the LiveCD, see this <uri link="livecd_pkgs.txt">list</uri>. </p>
