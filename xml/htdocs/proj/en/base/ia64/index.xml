  <longname>Gentoo Linux IA-64 Development</longname>

  <description>
    The IA-64 Development Project is devoted to keeping Gentoo in good shape
    on the IA-64 architecture.
  </description>

  <longdescription>

    <p>The Gentoo/IA-64 Project works to keep Gentoo the most up to date and
    fastest IA-64 distribution available. We are responsible for the
    maintainance of all IA-64 specific meta-data and the testing of all other
    non IA-64 specific meta-data on the IA-64 architecture to ensure
    portability. Portability implies reuseable meta-data.</p>

    <p>Bugs are tracked and resolved from the <uri
    link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo bug tracker</uri>.</p>

  <goals>

    <p>The goal of the Gentoo IA-64 development project is to guarantee that
    the IA-64 packages build using Gentoo meta-data are up to date.  By
    continuously enhancing the meta-data, we provide the IA-64 user with the
    Gentoo community feeling, performance, freedom and up to dateness.  The
    meta-distribution notion allows for a user to to be as bleeding edge as
    he/she wants:</p>

    <p>Gentoo is unique because of its interpretation of the Meta-Distribution
    notion: all architectures share the same 'generic' meta-data (information
    about how to build packages - how to build a distribution). The IA-64
    developers are responsible for building and testing packages using this
    meta-data.  The meta-data gets marked 'tested' or 'stable' afterwards,
    depending on the building and testing expierience. Our users can use (but
    don't have to use) this information to build a system that suits their
    needs.</p>

        <p>Can you make computers do amazing things? Are you excited about
        exploring areas of computing never explored before? We are continuously
        looking for volunteers willing to spend some of their free time on this
        project. In return for your work, you get the respect of the IA-64
        community.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in helping, but don't have a niche that you are
        interested in filling, you can always look through <uri
        link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>. There are many many
        bugs waiting to be found and fixed and many enhancements looking to find
        someone to code them. Figure out a fix, implement it, test it, and then
        keep trying to make the patch smaller. Post it for review on <uri
        link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, and keep working on
        it. If it seems ignored, make a new comment in the bug and/or mention it
        in #gentoo-IA64.</p>
