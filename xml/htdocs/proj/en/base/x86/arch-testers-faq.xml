<chapter>
<title>The Basics</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
This section aims to be quite generic and questions answered here hold true
across most archs in Gentoo.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="whoat">
<title>Who is an Arch Tester?</title>
<body>

<p>
An Arch Tester (commonly referred to as "AT") is a trustworthy user capable of
testing an application to determine its stability.  To be an AT you must be able
to test a wide array of packages, and be able to understand and modify ebuilds.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="whyat">
<title>Why does Gentoo need Arch Testers?</title>
<body>

<p>
We need ATs to help improve Quality Assurance (QA), and to help Arch Devs ensure
packages are actually stable by having it tested by others and reporting their
findings. As the tree gets larger and larger we will need more people to
actively watch for things that break, and help get them fixed.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="basicsk">
<title>What are the basic skills I need to be an AT?</title>
<body>

<p>
You should be able to modify ebuilds and recognize mistakes that should be
corrected before we mark the package stable. It is also expected you can test
packages and give good bug reports if there are problems with anything. This
means you should be comfortable with bash scripting as well as Gentoo specific
areas such as Portage overlays (since you'll be using them quite a bit) and so
on.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="basicsys">
<title>What are the basic system requirements if any?</title>
<body>

<p>
You'll need a system or chroot, which only uses packages marked "x86". This is
so we actually use stable libraries to test packages against, and can find bugs
in packages marked stable.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="x86at">
<title>What does it mean to be a part of the x86 AT Team?</title>
<body>

<p>
Being part of the x86 AT Team means you are prepared to dedicate some amount
of time to help Gentoo/x86. It also means that you are interested in helping
test any applications we are asked to mark stable.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="atwhat">
<title>What do I have to do as an AT? What are my
roles/responsibilities?</title>
<body>

<p>
You need to help arch devs test packages. Testing a package requires more
than just ensuring it compiles. It is expected that you will ensure that
atleast major functionality works in the application. When testing a package,
ensure you have <c>FEATURES="collision-protect"</c> on. If any package fails to
emerge with this feature set, it is a major QA issue and we can't proceed 
until its resolved.

<p>
This section deals with commonly asked "how to setup" style questions to guide
you through getting your system ready to do some AT work :)
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="stchroot">
<title>I don't run stable x86, my box is ~x86. How can I setup an x86
chroot?</title>
<body>

<p>
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="kernelv">
<title>I run an unstable kernel. Would that be an issue when I'm testing
packages?</title>
<body>

<p>
It is nice if you use a stable kernel outside of the chroot but it is not a
firm requirement.

<p>
Questions on how exactly to go about doing your work on a daily basis are
answered here.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="steptest">
<title>What are the steps I need to follow when I'm testing a package?</title>
<body>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that all packages in the system/chroot are all stable.</li>
  <li>
    Set <c>FEATURES="collision-protect"</c> in <path>/etc/make.conf</path> and
    use a "sane" set of <c>CFLAGS</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    After merging the package, run it and ensure that basic functionality works.
    If the package is a library, emerge a couple packages that use the library
    to ensure they still work with the new version.
  </li>
</ol>

</body>
</section>
<section id="powers">
<title>What godly powers do I have as an AT?</title>
<body>

<p>
Hah. You were joking when you asked that right? AT's are minions who do all the
work and have no powers or play......okay, I was kidding :)
</p>

<p>
Things you have access to/can do as an AT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Elevated priviledges on <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo
    Bugzilla</uri> so that you can modify all aspects of a bug. This is mainly
    given so that you can re-assign bugs correctly in case needed and
    co-ordinate	with package maintainers/other arch teams etc.
  </li>
  <li>Read-only cvs access to the gentoo-x86 repository</li>
</ul>

<warn>
Read-only access is not implemented for ATs yet. This might take a while to
happen. In the meanwhile, you can use <c>emerge --sync</c> once a day to keep
your local version up to date.
</warn>

<p>
Things you don't have access to/can't do as an AT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
     Commit fixes for ebuilds. You'll have to find the maintainer or another
     developer with access to do that for you.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section id="whomct">
<title>Whom do I contact in case of breakages?</title>
<body>

<p>
If you notice some major breakage in the tree, first try to contact the person
that caused the breakage. This can be found in the <path>ChangeLog</path>
normally, but if not, use <uri link="http://sources.gentoo.org/">ViewCVS</uri>
to see who committed the change. If you can't get in touch with this person, try
the maintainer or herd of the package (if the maintainer is not the same person
that caused the breakage). If all else fails, make an x86 dev aware of the
situation so we can address it as best as we can until someone is available to
address it properly.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="methct">
<title>What are the best ways of contacting maintainers/devs?</title>
<body>

<p>
Normally the easiest way to contact a dev is to "ping" them on IRC. If they
aren't around on IRC, send them an email. If you are unable to get in touch
with them, try contacting someone else in the herd (if applicable). If there
is no herd to get in touch with then tell someone in the x86 team what the
issue is and we'll figure out what the best way to proceed is. Also, unless the
problem is severe, give them enough time to respond back through email. Do check
the <uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/devaway/">devaway</uri> to make sure the
person you're trying to reach isn't away.
