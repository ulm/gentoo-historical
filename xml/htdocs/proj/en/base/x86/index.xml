<longname>Gentoo Linux x86 Archtecture Development</longname>

<description>
The Gentoo Linux x86 Development Project is devoted to keeping Gentoo Linux in
good shape on the x86 architecture.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
The Gentoo Linux/x86 Project works to keep Gentoo the most up to date and
secure x86 distribution available. We are responsible for the maintainance of
all x86 specific meta-data and the testing of all other non-x86 specific
meta-data on the x86 architecture to ensure portability. Portability implies
reuseable meta-data.
</p>

<p>
Bugs are tracked and resolved from the <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">
Gentoo bug tracker</uri> and correspondence is maintained on the various x86
related mailing lists.  (gentoo-x86-user, gentoo-x86-dev and those belonging to
the sub-projects).

<p>
The goal of the Gentoo Linux x86 Arhitecture Development project is to
guarantee that the x86 packages build using Gentoo meta-data are up to date.
By continuously enhancing the meta-data, we provide the x86 user with the
Gentoo community feeling, performance, freedom and up-to-dateness that they expect and deserve.  The meta-distribution notion allows for a user to to be as
bleeding edge as he/she wants:
</p>

<p>
Gentoo is unique because of its interpretation of the Meta-Distribution notion:
all architectures share the same 'generic' meta-data (information about how to
build packages - how to build a distribution). The x86 developers are
responsible for building and testing packages using this meta-data.  The
meta-data gets marked 'tested' or 'stable' afterwards, depending on the
building and testing expierience. Our users can use (but don't have to use)
this information to build a system that suits their needs.

		<p>
		Can you make computers do amazing things? Are you excited about
		exploring areas of computing never explored before? We are continuously
		looking for volunteers willing to spend some of their free time on this
		project. In return for your work, you get the respect of the x86
		community.
		</p>

        <p>
		If you are interested in helping, but don't have a niche that you are
		interested in filling, you can always look through <uri
		link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>. There are many,
		many bugs waiting to be found and fixed and many enhancements looking
		to find someone to code them. Figure out a fix, implement it, test it,
		and then keep trying to make the patch smaller. Post it for review on
		<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, and keep
		working on it. If it seems ignored, make a new comment in the bug
		and/or mention it in #gentoo-x86.
