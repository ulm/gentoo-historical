Abstract
========

The `Gentoo web site`_ is the main source of documentation regarding
Gentoo itself. It hosts all documents that the `Gentoo Documentation
Project`_ delivers, including all made translations.

.. _Gentoo web site: http://www.gentoo.org
.. _Gentoo Documentation Project: http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp

This GLEP proposes some changes regarding the documentation
so that we can provide our international users with information regarding
Gentoo Communities, as proposed by `Bug #23199`_.

Motivation
==========

Lots of people have shown interest in the localization proposal,
and even the infrastructure team has given positive feedback. However,
due to lack of a good roadmap and proposal this suggestion has never
grown beyond what it is now: a suggestion.

The current CVS structure (and permissions) are insufficient to implement a
localized section for each possible country. The current permissions are to 
broad while they should be very strict, the current layout is too fragmented 
while it should be grouped together.

Rationale
=========

The current layout regarding documentation in the CVS is as follows::

	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/en/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/nl/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/fr/*
	...

However, the documentation index page itself (and several other
important parts of the Gentoo website) are structed like this::

	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/main/en/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/main/nl/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/main/fr/*
	...

This structure makes it very difficult for assigning permissions to the
individual translation teams, and even more difficult to really localise
the Gentoo Website. At this very moment, the translation teams can edit
documents of other languages or even the master English documents. English
reviewers and editors can touch documents of languages they possibly don't
even know. Although we do trust every single documentation editor, a better 
implementation is advisable.

We want to restructure the current layout so that the Gentoo Website is
more easily internationalized.

Implementation
==============

CVS Structure
-------------

What is needed, is a clear distinction between documentation, newsletters,
website and localization. This requires a directory structure in the CVS
repository that reflects this distinction.

In the following scheme, everything is relative to [gentoo]/xml/htdocs::

	main/en			Contains the main Gentoo Website
	main/${LANGUAGE}	Contains some translated website pages
	main/lcl/${COUNTRYCODE}	Contains the localized Gentoo page
	doc/en			Contains the master English Documentation
	doc/${LANGUAGE}		Contains the translated Documentation
	news/en			Contains the English GWNs
	news/${LANGUAGE}	Contains the translated GWNs
	proj/en			Contains the project Webpages

In comparison with what is currently the case, there are no big changes.
I've explicitly left out `proj/${LANGUAGE}` since there is no direct
need to translate project websites. If it is desired, then creating a
language-specific directory is sufficient.

Website pages
-------------

Currently, the main documentation page is `main/en/docs.xml`. A better
implementation would be to have it as `doc/en/index.xml`. This keeps
everything documentation-related together. It also provides us with
seperate index pages for each language (`doc/${LANGUAGE}/index.xml`).

The documentation indexes should mention the other indexes (for other
languages), but shouldn't have seperate links for each language per
document.

The localization page resides in `main/${COUNTRYCODE}/index.xml`. This
page, which is formatted the same way as the whole Gentoo website,
**only** contains the following information::

	- A list of community websites [1]_

	- A link to the translated documentation index

	- A link to translated Gentoo-webpages::

		* About

		* Social Contract

		* Gentoo Weekly News

If the localization team wants, this can be extended to also provide
news-items (such as with the main Gentoo website). In this case, the
news items also reside in `main/lcl/${COUNTRYCODE}`.

Also, `http://${COUNTRYCODE}.gentoo.org` should point to
`main/lcl/${COUNTRYCODE}/index.xml`.

CVS Permissions
---------------

The permissions are now clear and distinct::

	- Documentation Developers cannot touch the Gentoo website,
	  except for the Index page, which now resides in `doc/en`.

	- Translators can only touch files in `doc/${LANGUAGE}` and
	  `main/${LANGUAGE}`. 

	- The localized pages, which are rather static (since they only
	  contain a list of community sites), are maintained by a
	  single group for all countrycodes, unless the localization
	  pages also contain newsitems, in which case seperate groups
	  for each country can exist.
