Abstract
========

The `Gentoo web site`_ is the main source of documentation regarding
Gentoo itself. It hosts all documents that the `Gentoo Documentation
Project`_ delivers, including all made translations.

.. _Gentoo web site: http://www.gentoo.org
.. _Gentoo Documentation Project: http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp

This GLEP proposes a change in CVS structure regarding the documentation
so that the individual translation teams can create a localized Gentoo
website as proposed by `Bug #23199`_.

.. _Bug #23199: http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23199

Motivation
==========

Lots of people have shown interest in the internationalization proposal,
and even the infrastructure team has given positive feedback. However,
due to lack of a good roadmap and proposal this suggestion has never
grown beyond what it is now: a suggestion.

The current CVS structure (and permissions) are insufficient to implement an
internationalized website. The current permissions are to broad while they
should be very strict, the current layout is too fragmented while it should be
grouped together.

Rationale
=========

The current layout regarding documentation in the CVS is as follows::

	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/en/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/nl/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/fr/*
	...

However, the documentation index page itself (and several other
important parts of the Gentoo website) are structed like this::

	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/main/en/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/main/nl/*
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/main/fr/*
	...

This structure makes it very difficult for assigning permissions to the
individual translation teams, and even more difficult to really localise
the Gentoo Website. At this very moment, the translation teams can edit
documents of other languages or even the master English documents. English
reviewers and editors can touch documents of languages they possibly don't
even know. Although we do trust every single documentation editor, a better 
implementation is advisable.

We want to restructure the current layout so that the Gentoo Website is
more easily internationalized.

Implementation
==============

CVS Structure
-------------

A better implementation is to fully seperate each language from the
other. For instance::

	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/doc
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/main
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/proj
	...
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/nl/doc
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/nl/main
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/nl/proj
	...
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/fr/doc
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/fr/main
	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/fr/proj
	...

This implementation has several advantages:

* Easy (and more secure) CVS permissions

  Every translation team can now be contained in its own group regarding
  permissions. That group has access to the full
  [gentoo]/xml/htdocs/${LANGUAGE} directory and subdirectories. Other
  languages (including English) cannot be touched by the translation
  teams.

* Better integration regarding the website

  Currently, the website's `documentation page`_ lists all translations
  too. Every time a new translation is uploaded, the links are adjusted.
  With the new structure, the translation teams are in charge of their
  own documentation page which can be found through
  http://www.gentoo.org/${LANGUAGE}/main/docs.xml.

* Internationalization of the website

  In this stadium http://www.gentoo.org/${LANGUAGE} would host the
  internationalized Gentoo web site. The infrastructure-team would then
  make sure that http://${LANGUAGE}.gentoo.org refers to the
  beforementioned URL.

.. _documentation page: http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/docs.xml

This CVS restructure shouldn't take much time, it does require an atomic
move of the existing directories, meaning CVS access for all affected
parties (and this *includes* the Gentoo Project webpages) would be
unavailable during the transition. It also requires a rewrite of permissions
which is discussed further down this GLEP.

	
Internationalized Website
-------------------------

The Gentoo web servers (and their update-pace) aren't created for
high-volume data transfers or updates. Therefor a consensus was made
that the teams in charge of the internationalization of the Gentoo web
site (in this proposal the translation teams) would not create a
blog-like situation, but link existing localised gentoo communities [1]_
from the http://${LANGUAGE}.gentoo.org website. 

Some people might ask why we wouldn't just have
http://${LANGUAGE}.gentoo.org refer (through DNS or otherwise) to the
respective community site. This is because that implementation is only
plausible if there is only one community site regarding the
language/country. However, there can be several such community sites,
and providing one with the referral and not the other would be
discriminating.

Permissions
-----------

The proposed implementation would result in the following possible
permission scheme (all read/write)::

	cvswebdoc:	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/main and [gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/doc
	cvsnlweb:	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/nl
	cvsfrweb:	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/fr
	...
	cvskernel:	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/proj/kernel
	cvsgdp:		[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/proj/gdp
	cvsinfrastruct:	[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/en/proj/infrastructure

As you can see, the translation teams are in charge of the whole
internationalization: translation of website, projects, documentation.

The English documentation team is contained in cvswebdoc and has access
to the doc/ subdirectory (in which the documentation resides) and the
main/ subdirectory (in which the docs.xml page and others reside).

The project web pages themselves are contained in seperate groups as is
currently the case.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Although nothing gets lost, the new implementation is not compatible with the
current one. However, due to the nature of documentation (and website) this is
not a problem.
