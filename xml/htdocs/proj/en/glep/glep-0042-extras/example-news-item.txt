YourSQL databases created using YourSQL version 4.0 are incompatible
with YourSQL version 4.1 or later. There is no reliable way to
automate the database format conversion, so action from the system
administrator is required before an upgrade can take place.

Please see the Gentoo YourSQL Upgrade Guide for instructions:

    http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/yoursql-upgrading.xml

Also see the official YourSQL documentation:

    http://dev.yoursql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/upgrading-from-4-0.html

After upgrading, you should also recompile any packages which link
against YourSQL:

    revdep-rebuild --library=libyoursqlclient.so.12

The revdep-rebuild tool is provided by app-portage/gentoolkit.
