Abstract
========

``metadata.xml`` should allow the use of tags to add information related to
upstream, such as who the upstream maintainers are, the upstream changelog and
where to report bugs.


Motivation
==========

Allowing developers to add upstream information in ``metadata.xml`` will make it
easier, faster and more reliable to share it with other developers. Having
information from upstream should avoid duplicated work in tasks such as browsing
upstream's Homepage and mailing lists.


Specification
=============

``metadata.dtd`` should allow the use of a upstream tag in ``metadata.xml``.
Inside the upstream tag, developers should be able to add upstream information
in the tags named ``maintainer, ``changelog``, ``bugs-to`` and ``remote-id``.

This GLEP defines the following four tags for ``upstream``:
``maintainer``, ``changelog``, ``bugs-to`` and ``remote-id``, none of which are
mandatory. Future GLEPs may extend this -- tools processing metadata.xml should
ignore unrecognized elements.

``maintainer`` can contain the tags ``name`` and ``email``, indicating the
person/organization responsible for upstream maintainership of the package.

``name`` should contain a block of text with upstream's name.

``email`` should contain an e-mail address in the format foo@bar.bar.

``changelog`` should contain a URL prefixed with http or https where the
location of the upstream changelog can be found.

``bugs-to`` should contain a place where bugs can be filed, a URL prefixed with
http or https or an e-mail address.

``remote-id`` should specify a type of package identification tracker and the
identification that corresponds to the package in question. ``remote-id`` should
make it easier to index information like its identification in freshmeat or its
cpan identification.

For example::

	<upstream>
	<maintainer>
	<name>Foo Bar</name>
	<email>foo@bar.bar</email>
	</maintainer>
	<changelog>http://foo.bar/changelog.txt</changelog>
	<bugs-to>https://bugs.foo.bar</bugs-to>
	<remote-id type="freshmeat">12345</remote-id>
	<remote-id type="sourceforge">foobar</remote-id>
	</upstream>


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

No changes are necessary to existing ``metadata.xml``. Information in the new
tags should not be mandatory.
