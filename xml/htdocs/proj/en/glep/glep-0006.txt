I stole this idea from liquidx who probably stole it from one of the many
projects that do something similar.


Abstract
========

Gentoo Linux should have one day a month that is devoted to clearing out bugs,
and accepting new ebuilds from bugzilla.  This one day a month should not
replace a developers normal bug tracking duties. This "bug day" should become
something that involves the user community to make them feel closer to the 
developers.

Motivation
==========

I believe this would help keep the number of bugs in bugzilla at a lower level.
This would also be a good chance for some user submitted ebuilds to be commited
that would normally go overlooked. I think this is a good idea. We could turn
this into a big deal for the user community

Specification
=============

This doesn't require any coding. It just requires one day each month that 
little other than bug closing will happen. I would like to see all developers
participate, but I know it's unlikely that we could get everybody free on the 
same day. The majority of the people that have had an opinion have 
suggested a weekend day. We will have bugday's on a Saturday. Gentoo 
developers can try to get some of the users to help them out. A prize to 
the most succesful developer was suggested. This is an idea to keep in 
mind for the future. I guess I'm going to be the one coordinating this 
until I get help, but when I do get help in coordinating this we can 
coordinate via irc if all parties are capable, or email if not. I will 
send out a notice telling the details at least one week in advance to the
-dev, -core, and -user mailing lists.

Rationale
=========

Gnome [1]_ , Mozilla, Zope [2]_ , and other open source projects do something similar with good 
success.
