I stole this idea from liquidx who probably stole it from one of the many
projects that do something similar.


Abstract
========

Gentoo Linux should have one day a month that is devoted to clearing out bugs,
and accepting new ebuilds from bugzilla.  This one day a month should not
replace a developers normal bug tracking duties. This "bug day" should become
something that involves the user community to make them feel closer to the 
developers.

Motivation
==========

I believe this would help keep the number of bugs in bugzilla at a lower level.
This would also be a good chance for some user submitted ebuilds to be commited
that would normally go overlooked. I think this is a good idea. We could turn
this into a big deal for the user community

Specification
=============

This doesn't require any coding. It just requires one day each month that 
little other than bug closing will happen. I would like to see all developers
participate, but I know it's unlikely that we could get everybody free on the 
same day.

Rationale
=========

Gnome, KDE, and other open source projects do something similar with good 
success.
