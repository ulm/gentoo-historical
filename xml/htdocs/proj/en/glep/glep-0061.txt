Abstract
========
Deals with compression of large Manifest2 files.

Motivation
==========
With the introduction of MetaManifest, and full-tree Manifest coverage,
we are faced with the possibility of having very large Manifests.

Preliminary experiments with MetaManifest, show that with just the
existing per-package Manifests, the full MetaManifest, for a tree
including metadata/, exceeds 8MiB in size. Applying common compression
can achieve a 50-60% reduction in this size.

Specification
=============
When searching for a Manifest2 file, if the basename form does not
exist, the package manager should search in the same location using
common compressed suffixes, and use the compressed file in place of the
Manifest2.

gzip, bzip2, lzma should all be supported if available on the given
platform. In the case that multiple versions exist, the package manager
should simply pick one - they should be identical, differing only in
compression.

The Manifest generation process is required to ensure that inconsistent
compressed versions do not exist.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================
The package Manifests should also be maintained as ONLY uncompressed in
CVS.

For processing of all existing per-package Manifests, if compression is
used, it should be done in parallel to the existing Manifests, to
provide for a changeover period. Newer versions of Portage may later
choose to exclude all non-compressed Manifests during emerge --sync if
compressed versions are guaranteed to exist on the servers.

MetaManifests may come into existence as compressed from the start, as
do not have an backwards compatibility issues.

As a side note, this breaks all manual interaction with Manifests
such as grep, and so should only be applied to large Manifest2 files,
such as the MetaManifest. 384KiB is suggested as a arbitary cut-off
point to start generating compressed Manifest2 files.
