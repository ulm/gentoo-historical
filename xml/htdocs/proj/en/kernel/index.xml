	<longname>Gentoo Kernel Project</longname>
	<description>The Gentoo Kernel project has the goal of bringing a stable and consistent
kernel feature set across all architectures supported by Gentoo Linux</description>
	<longdescription>
<p>
With an ever increasing userbase demanding a higher quality of stable, production-ready kernel sources and featureful desktop support the professionalism and staffing of the kernel project is very important. Because we as users want the best from Gentoo Linux we supply a selection of both generic and specialised sources capable of handling the day-to-day grind to make life a little easier.
</p>
<p>
In order to provide a rich choice of high quality kernel trees Gentoo Linux must apply, write and test several kernel patches to the official upstream releases before they can offer finished ebuilds to the users. This is where the Gentoo Kernel project comes into play.
</p>
	</longdescription>
<goals><p>
The Gentoo Kernel Project aims to deliver the best possible experience from its sources across all supported architectures. By maintaining quality control, clearly defined road maps, highly skilled developers and a standard base across all of our kernels the project will help bring the end-user experience of our kernels to even higher levels.

	<p>
	The Gentoo Kernel project provides ebuilds for other linux kernels such as ac-sources, ck-sources, mm-sources, rsbac-sources, usermode-sources, vanilla-sources, vserver-sources, win4lin-sources and xbox-sources. Most of these are not patched by Gentoo in any way, and therefore are provided as a courtesy.

<title>Quality Objectives</title>
<body>
<p>
Each subproject must make sure that the kernel ebuilds they provide adhere to the following quality demands:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each kernel ebuild must compile and work on as many systems as possible before committing to the Portage tree (even if <path>package.mask</path> is used).</li>
<li>Each kernel ebuild should not have Gentoo-specific bugs on <uri>http://bugs.gentoo.org/</uri> in the last 1-2 weeks after being released before moving from <path>~ARCH</path> to <path>ARCH</path></li>
<li>Every kernel-tree released by the Gentoo Kernel Project must have a clear description on what it provides and what philosophy is behind it's existence</li>
<li>Any kernel feature that has a userspace utility, must have the appropriate userspace utility ready for inclusion in portage before the kernel is released (ie. evms2, freeswan, USAGI,...). All packages should be released at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</body>

<section>
<title>Time line Objectives</title>
<body>

<p>
As kernels continue to develop in a vast pace, the Gentoo Kernel Project must make sure that it keeps track of all kernel trees it provides so that our users will receive the latest and greatest kernel trees in a timely fashion without losing the quality they are accustomed to.

<section>
<title>Accountability</title>
<body>
<p>
The Gentoo Kernel Project cannot guarantee that the provided kernel ebuilds work on your system, but will rectify any faults with supported sources. Some sources (upstream sources) cannot be supported.

<title>Roadmap</title>
<body>
<p>
As with most projects, the Gentoo Kernel Project and it's subprojects use a roadmap to inform the users and developers about current development items, near-future integrations, seeable future enhancements and far future proposals.

Currently, this is not available.

<p>
In order for our users to be able to pick the best kernel ebuild we provide them with a <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-kernel.xml">Kernel Guide</uri> in which all available kernel ebuilds are listed and described.
