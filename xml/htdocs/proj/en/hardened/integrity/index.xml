<name>Integrity</name>
<longname>System Integrity, Compliance and Reporting</longname>

<description>
The integrity subproject aims to integrate and maintain technologies related to
system integrity within Gentoo Hardened. Its first focus will be on the
Linux IMA/EVM implementation, but this will be extended towards other
integrity, compliance and reporting related technologies.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
This project will support the Linux IMA/EVM technology within Gentoo Linux, as
well as other integrity-related technologies together with compliance and
reporting specific technologies. It will support the necessary kernel patches,
utilities and documentation to make integrity checks, compliance and reporting
available to the wider public. The primary focus is to prevent tampering of
files, settings and images: when this occurs, the boot-up of the system detects
the tampering and refuses to load further (or report this to the administrator).
Online tampering detection is a second step.
</p>

<p>
Next to the integrity subsystem within Linux (IMA/EVM), this project will
also support the various trusted computing technologies (such as TPM
support) through well-documented guides and tools. 
</p>

</longdescription>

<goals>
<p>
The main goal of this project is to support all integrity-related technologies
in Gentoo Linux, offering good integration, tools and documentation to help
users in setting up a more secure, managed environment, fully in line with
the Gentoo Hardened vision.

<title>Integrity Measurement Architecture</title>
<body>

<p>
IMA, or Integrity Measurement Architecture, is a Linux kernel integrity
subsystem which aims to detect if files have been altered. It supports the
collection of file integrity data (hashing), storage of the integrity values
both locally (in extended attributes) and through TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
protection. If a TPM is present, it can sign these integrity results so that
interested parties can attest that the system has not been tampered with.
</p>

<p>
A fourth function, called "appraisal", has yet to be accepted in the main Linux
kernel. This function allows local validation of the integrity value against a
known good value.

<title>Extended Verification Module</title>
<body>

<p>
While IMA provides a layer of protection against tampering of file content,
EVM (Extended Verification Module) provides protection against tampering of
file metadata (more specifically the security extended attributes). And as
IMA stores the integrity values of the files in such extended attributes, it
makes sense to properly protect these too.

<title>How Do I Use This?</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
  RSBAC can be installed new on a system by following the above install guide
  for your architecture.  If there is not an install guide for your architecuture
  yet, it is still possible to install by following the <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/index.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>.
  When the system is installed, convert it to RSBAC by using the
  Quickstart Guide.
  It is suggested that you use the Hardened profile or use "hardened pie" as your USE flags during this installation.

</p>
<p>
  Converting a preexisting Gentoo installation to RSBAC can be done by
  following the Quickstart Guide.

<title>I Want to Participate</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
To participate in the Integrity project first join the mailing list at
<c>gentoo-hardened@gentoo.org</c> and, if you can, visit our online IRC
channel at <c>#gentoo-hardened</c> on <c>irc.freenode.net</c>.
</p>

<p>
As this project is brand new, there are still lots of fields to contribute
in: supporting the IMA appraisal patch, documentation, TPM and trusted computing
support in general, etc.
