<title>What is ProPolice?</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
   ProPolice is a GCC extension for protecting from stack-smashing
   applications. It is a implemented as a patch to GCC which will
   automatically insert protection code into your programs at compile
   time. It is developed by Hiroaki Etoh at IBM. For more information
   visit the official 
   <uri link="http://www.trl.ibm.com/projects/security/ssp/">ProPolice website</uri>.
</p>
<p>
   Overall this is an excellent security measure. We know that the applications
   we use have yet to be discovered bugs, and this protection helps
   minimize the possibility of an exploit due to these bugs. The flawed
   application may well still crash, but privileges will not be
   escalated, and your system will not be compromised. Best of all, we'll
   get some information on where in the program code the overflow
   occurred, which will allow us to quickly track down the problem and
   fix it.
</p>
<p>
   However, ProPolice does not catch all possible overflows, and there
   are still some cases that will get through the stack-smashing
   protection code. This is not an end all, be all solution to security,
   it is merely a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
   This patch was recently implemented in OpenBSD-current (soon to be 3.3),
   and looks to be an excellent addition to proactive security.

<title>Warning</title>
<body>
<p>
   I must warn you that this is still a new project, and there are still
   some pitfalls and bugs involved in running it. For now, I would not
   recommend this be run by the average user, or by anyone with a system
   in a mission critical position.
</p>
<p>
   However, anyone who would like to contribute to the development or
   testing/bug-fixing of this project, please go ahead and run it! Since
   this will eventually be targeted at secure systems, it needs all the
   testing it can get.

<title>GCC Patch</title>
<body>
<p>
   ProPolice is implemented as a <b>GCC patch</b>. This patch includes a diff
   against the GCC code, as well as two additional files (a source file
   and a header file). There is also an optional diff that will cause
   stack protection to be enabled by default. I do not recommend this
   latter patch be applied, as it tends to cause problems with a number
   of things, including kernel compilation. The <c>gcc-3.2.2-r3 ebuild</c>
   in portage is now patched for propolice support.
</p>
<p>
   ProPolice adds two new <c>CFLAGS</c> to GCC. 
   These are <c>-fstack-protector</c>
   to enable the stack protection, and <c>-fno-stack-protector</c> (default
   behavior) to explicitly disable the protection.
</p>
<p>
   If you would the protection on by default add <c>-fstack-protector</c> to
   your <c>CFLAGS</c> in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.

<title>Results so far</title>
<body>
<p>
   My tests so far have been quite successful. I have however ran into a
   few pitfalls related to ProPolice on Gentoo.
</p>
<p>
<b>Portage/glibc</b><br/><br/>
   The first, and probably most significant problem stems from portage
   and glibc. If glibc is built with stack protection, portage's sandbox
   will break, and you will no longer be able to emerge packages.
</p>
<p>I have narrowed the problem down, and it seems to be a bug in the sandbox
   code itself, rather than in glibc.  What happens here is that any program 
   linked against libpthread will segfault when executed through the sandbox.
   Since tar is linked to libpthread, the emerge will fail while trying to
   unpack the package archive.  I'm still working on tracking down the source
   of this bug.  If anyone has any ideas or fixes for this problem, please
   let me know.
</p>
<p>Until a suitable fix for this sandbox problem is discovered, there are a
   couple different approaches to take:
</p>
<p>Recently, <c>-fstack-protector</c>
   has been been added to the <c>ALLOWED_FLAGS</c> that are not stripped by 
   a <c>strip-flags</c> declaration in an ebuild.  For this reason, by default
   glibc will be built with stack protection, thus breaking the sandbox.  In 
   order to maintain a usable system (i.e. one you can use portage on), you 
   <b>MUST</b> add <c>FEATURES=-sandbox</c> to your <path>/etc/make.conf</path> 
   file.  In this approach, you will lose the benefits of the sandbox, but gain
   the benefit of a protected glibc.  If you take this approach, please do not
   send bug reports about portage segfaulting when you try to emerge packages.
   We know about the problem, and we're working on a fix for it.
</p>
<p>The next approach you can take is to filter the <c>-fstack-protector</c> flag
   from the glibc ebuild.  To do this, you must add <c>-fstack-protector</c> to 
   the <c>filter-flags</c> list in the glibc ebuild.  If you take this approach,
   you will maintain the sandbox, but lose out on a stack protected glibc.  The
   choice is yours.
</p>
<p>
<b>XFree86</b><br/><br/>
   XFree86 as of <c>4.3.0-r2</c> no longer strips the <c>-fstack-protector</c> flag.
   All of XFree86 can be built successfully with stack protection <b>except</b> 
   the video modules.  This allows us to protect the networking code in XFree86, 
   the most vulnerable to attack.  To build XFree86 with stack protection, a small 
   patch is required.  This patch causes some OpenBSD specific XFree86 code to be 
   run to determine if we are using a ProPolice patched GCC.  If it finds that we are, 
   it will then explicitely add <c>-fno-stack-protector</c> to the module building, but keep
   <c>-fstack-protector</c> for the rest of the source.  This patch is included in the
   <c>4.3.0-r2</c> XFree86 ebuild.
</p>
<p>
<b>Other Problems</b><br/><br/>
   There are a few other programs that will not successfully build with
   stack protection enabled. This include grub, cracklib (part of the
   base system), tetex, and ocaml.  These ebuilds have been updated in
   portage to filter out the stack protection for now, so you should not
   have any problems with them.  If you run into any other packages that
   will not build due to ProPolice, please report them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Building an entire system with stack protection</b><br/><br/>
   It is now possible to bootstrap and build an entire machine with ProPolice
   stack-smashing protection.  All you need to do at this point is be sure to
   use the <c>gcc-3.2.2-r3</c> ebuild (you will need to unmask it, also remember
   it is in the unstable branch), and add <c>-fstack-protector</c> to your
   <c>CFLAGS</c> in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.  Things should be quite
   stable at this point, but please report any problems you run into.
</p>
<p>
<b>What now?</b><br/><br/>
   There are plans to merge this project into the base Gentoo system as an
   optional feature.  This is now officially a part of the Hardened Gentoo 
   effort, along with many other security enhancements.  Before any of this 
   is incorporated in the base system it needs more testing, especially on 
   non x86 platforms.
</p>
<p>
   I will be be providing more info and more bug fixes as I continue my
   testing and development of this project.

<title>Files</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
   These files are now included in the portage tree, and are no longer necessary.
   I have left the link here temporarily for informational purposes.  You 
   <b>DO NOT</b> need any of these files for a ProPolice protected system.
