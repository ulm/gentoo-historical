<description>
Hardened Gentoo brings advanced security measures to Gentoo Linux.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
Hardened Gentoo is a project which oversees the research, implementation, and
maintenance of security oriented projects for Gentoo Linux. We are a team of
very competent individuals dedicated to bring advanced security to Gentoo
with a number of subprojects.
</p>

</longdescription>

<goals>
<p>
Hardened Gentoo's purpose is to make Gentoo viable for highly secure, high
stability production server environments. This project is not a standalone
project separated from the rest of Gentoo. Instead, it is intended to be a team
of Gentoo developers who are focused on delivering solutions to Gentoo that
provide strong security and stability. These solutions will be available in
Gentoo once they've been tested for security and stability by the Hardened team.

<extraproject name="PaX/Grsecurity" lead="blueness">
Grsecurity is a complete security solution providing such features as a MAC or
RBAC system, chroot restrictions, address space modification protection (via
PaX), auditing features, randomization features, linking restrictions to prevent
file race conditions, ipc protections and much more.
</extraproject>

<extraproject name="Hardened Toolchain" lead="Zorry">
Transparent implementation of
<uri link="http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt">PaX</uri> address space
layout randomizations and stack smashing protections using ELF shared objects as
executables.
</extraproject>

<extraproject name="Hardened Kernel Sources" lead="blueness">
A kernel which provides patches for hardened subprojects, and stability/security
oriented patches. Includes Grsecurity and SELinux.
</extraproject>

<!-- Still rewieving it.
<plannedproject name="Security Documentation">Maintain
documentation about best practices, and general security measures
such as process limiting, setting quotas, securing systems with
kerberos, chrooting, tightening services, etc.</plannedproject>

<title>I Want to Participate</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
To participate in the Hardened Gentoo project first join the mailing list at
<mail link="gentoo-hardened@lists.gentoo.org">
gentoo-hardened@lists.gentoo.org</mail>. Next, ask if there are plans to
support something that you are interested in, propose a new subproject that you
are interested in, choose one of the planned subprojects to work on or simply
ask if you can help with something. You can also talk to the developers and
users in the IRC channel <c>#gentoo-hardened</c> on <c>irc.freenode.net</c> for
more information or just to chat about the project or any subprojects.
</p>

<p>
If you think you don't have the knowledge or abilities to help, then try reading
the current documents (there are always sections that can be improved or typos
which we miss) and when you feel brave enough then try writing those documents
you missed. Usually this only requires some internet research on your side and
after some documents you'll most probably be able to help with other things you
thought you weren't able to help with before.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you don't have time to actively help by contributing work we will
always need testers to maintain the security and stability of the overall
product. All development, testing, and productive comments and feedback will be
greatly appreciated.
