<title>General Questions</title>
<section id="toolchain">
<title>What exactly is the "toolchain"?</title>
<body>

<p>
The term "toolchain" refers to the combination of software packages commonly used to
build and develop for a particular architecture.  The toolchain you may hear referred to
in the gentoo-hardened irc channel consists of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), binutils,
and the GNU C library (glibc).
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="whichisbetter">
<title>What should I use: RSBAC, SELinux, or Grsecurity?</title>
<body>

<p>
The answer to this question is highly subjective, so the hardened gentoo project simply
tries to lay out each technology and leave the choice up to the user.  This decision requires
a lot of research that we have hopefully provided clearly in the hardened
documentation.  However, if you have any specific questions about the security model that each provides,
feel free to question the relevant developer in our irc channel or on the mailing list.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="aclall">
<title>Is it possible to use Grsecurity, SELinux, and PaX all at the same time?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, this combination is quite possible as PaX works with both Grsecurity
and SELinux.  The only conflict that arises is you can only use one access control system.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="hardenedkernelpatches">
<title>Where can I find a list of patches included in hardened-dev-sources?</title>
<body>

<p>
Patches for hardened-dev-sources are stored at <uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~tseng/kernel/</uri>.
To see the patch list, simply download the relevant patchset for your kernel, unpack it, and
look through the file named 0000-README.
</p>

<section id="libbitmap">
<title>
How do I get rid of the error "Symbol __guard from module /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/fonts/libbitmap.a
is unresolved!"
</title>
<body>

<p>
This is an issue that arises from compiling Xorg using hardened gcc.  Work is being done on the dll
loader for Xorg in order to alleviate the problem.  In order to get Xorg working currently, please
refer to the doc located at: <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/hardenedxorg.xml</uri>.  Also
to track current progress refer to <uri>http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43177</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="hardenedcflags">
<title>Do I need to pass any flags to LDFLAGS/CFLAGS in order to turn on PIE/SSP building?</title>
<body>

<p>
No, the current toolchain implements the equivalent of CFLAGS="-fPIE -fstack-protector-all"
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,relro" automatically through GCC's specfile which is a more proper
solution.  For older hardened-gcc users, add <c>USE="hardened"</c> to your /etc/make.conf and then
upgrade with the following commands:
</p>

<pre caption="Hardened Toolchain Installation">
emerge binutils gcc glibc
emerge -e world
</pre>

<note>
A new patch has been added to all ~arch GCCs that allows a specfile to be passed through an
environment variable.  Sometime in the future a dual set of specfiles will be installed to gentoo
systems so that all users on supported architectures will be able to easily switch the functionality
off and on.  Correct usage of this variable is shown below:
</note>

<pre caption="Example GCC_SPECS Usage">
GCC_SPECS=/path/to/specs gcc -v
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section id="hardenedcflagsoff">
<title>How do I turn off PIE/SSP building?</title>
<body>

<p>
To turn off default SSP building when using the hardened toolchain, append
<c>-fno-stack-protector-all -fno-stack-protector</c> to your <c>CFLAGS</c>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to turn off default PIE building then append <c>-nopie</c> to
your <c>CFLAGS</c>.
</p>

<impo>
The flag <c>-fno-pic</c> should not be used as it will specifically enable
non-PIC code.  Using <c>-nopie</c> instead will revert back to vanilla GCC
behavior which should be the intended result.
</impo>

<note>
If you are interested in using per-package CFLAGS with portage currently then
you may be interested in reading about the script solar has developed to deal
with this: <uri>http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.hardened/1204</uri>

<section id="fsexec">
<title>My kernel compilation fails with the error "error: structure has no member named `curr_ip'",
how do I fix that?</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to use PaX on hardened-dev-sources, you must enable Grsecurity as well
in your kernel config.  This should be fixed in a future kernel.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="hardenedproject">
<title>I just found out about the hardened project; do I have to install everything on the
project page in order to install Hardened Gentoo?</title>
<body>

<p>
No, the Hardened Gentoo Project is a collection of subprojects that all have common security
minded goals.  While many of these projects can be installed alongside one another, some conflict
as well such as several of the ACL implementations that Hardened Gentoo offers.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="Othreessp">
<title>Why don't my programs work when I use CFLAGS="-O3" and hardened gcc?</title>
<body>

<p>
Using the gcc optimization flag "-O3" has been known to be problematic
with stack-smashing protector (SSP) in some situations. This
optimization flag is not officially supported and therefore discouraged
by the hardened team. Compile issues where a user uses
<c>CFLAGS="-O3"</c> will be closed as INVALID/CANTFIX and or ignored.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="cascadebootstrap">
<title>What happened to bootstrap-cascade.sh?</title>
<body>

<p>
Recently, the old bootstrap.sh and bootstrap-2.6.sh were deprecated.  In their
place, bootstrap-cascade.sh has been renamed to bootstrap.sh.

<section id="hardenedprofile">

<body>

<pre caption="Set make.profile">
cd /etc
rm make.profile
ln -s ../usr/portage/profiles/hardened/x86 make.profile
</pre>

<p>
After setting up your profile, you should recompile your system using a hardened
toolchain so that you have a consistent base:

emerge binutils gcc glibc

<title>PaX Questions</title>

<body>

<p>
The homepage for PaX is located at <uri>http://pax.grsecurity.net</uri>.

<section id="paxgentoodoc">
<title>What gentoo documentation exists about PaX?</title>
<body>

<p>
Currently the only gentoo documentation that exists about Pax is a PaX quickstart
guide located at the <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/pax-quickstart.xml</uri> website.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="paxnoelf">
<title>I keep getting the message: "error while loading shared libraries: cannot make segment 
writable for relocation: Permission denied."  What does this mean?</title>
<body>

<p>
This error occurs when you enable CONFIG_PAX_NOELFRELOCS as such:
</p>

<pre caption="Menuconfig Options">
Non-executable page ->

 [*]   Disallow ELF text relocations
</pre>

<p>
If you are using the gentoo hardened toolchain, typically compiling your programs will create
PIC ELF libraries that do not contain text relocations.  However, certain libraries still contain
text relocations for various reasons (often ones that contain assembly that is handled incorrectly).
This can be a security vulnerability as an attacker can use non-PIC libraries to execute his shellcode.
Non-PIC libraries are also bad for memory consumption as they defeat the code sharing purpose of 
shared libraries.
</p>

<p>
To disable this error and allow your program to run, you must sacrifice security and allow runtime
code generation for that program.  The PaX feature that allows you to do that is called MPROTECT.
You must disable MPROTECT on whatever executable is using the non-PIC library.
</p>

<note>
To check your system for textrels, you can use the program check-textrel that solar has
written for that purpose located in his development space: 
<uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~solar/pax/misc/check-textrel</uri>.

<section id="paxjava">
<title>Ever since I started using PaX I can't get java working, why?</title>
<body>

<p>
As part of its design, the Java virtual machine creates a considerable amount
of code at runtime which does not make PaX happy.  There are two ways to correct
this problem:
</p>

<pre caption="Install Chpax">
emerge chpax
/etc/init.d/chpax start
</pre>

<p>
Or if you already have chpax emerged then you can do:
</p>

<pre caption="Java Chpax Options">
chpax -pemrxs /opt/*-jdk-*/{jre,}/bin/*
</pre>

<p>
Both of these options will slightly modify the ELF eheader in order to correctly set the PAX flags
on the binaries.
</p>

<note>
If you are running PaX in conjunction with an additional security implementation such as RSBAC, Grsecurity,
or SELinux you should manage PaX using the kernel hooks provided for each implementation.
</note>

<p>
On RSBAC, you can label all java files with the following command.
</p>

<pre caption="Java PaX options with RSBAC">
for i in $(ls /opt/*(jdk|sdk)*/{jre,}/bin/*);do attr_set_file_dir FILE $i pax_flags pmerxs;done

<section id="grsecgentoodoc">
<title>What gentoo documentation exists about Grsecurity?</title>
<body>

<p>
The most current documentation for Grsecurity is a Grsecurity2 quickstart guide
located at <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/grsecurity.xml</uri>.
</p>

</section>

<section id="grsec2681">
<title>Can I use Grsecurity with a 2.6.8, 2.6.8.1, or 2.6.9 kernel?</title>
<body>

<p>
Due to significant changes in the 2.6.8 kernel that broke PaX, neither a PaX
nor a Grsecurity patch are available for kernels 2.6.8, 2.6.8.1, or 2.6.9.
Although an experimental patch is available for 2.6.10, the
official stance of the PaX Team regarding 2.6 kernels should be noted
and taken into consideration before use: <uri>

<section id="rsbac4kstack">
<title>Ever since I upgraded my kernel RSBAC does not work correctly
and I get kernel panics.  Is this related to the new 4K stacks kernel option?</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, RSBAC does not support the new 4K stacks kernel option.  It is planned for a future 
release but a lot of the code has to be reworked to fit in such small stacks.  Do not
use 4K stacks with the current RSBAC release (1.2.3).
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="rsbacinitrd">
<title>How do I use an initial ramdisk with a RSBAC enabled kernel?</title>
<body>

<p>
To use an initial ramdisk with a RSBAC enabled kernel, a special kernel option
must be enabled or else RSBAC will treat the initrd as the root device:
