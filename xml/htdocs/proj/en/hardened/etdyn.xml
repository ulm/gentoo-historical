	<title>Introduction</title>
	<body>
   <p>One of the features of PaX is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
   that allows the kernel to randomize the addresses of various areas in
   the task's address space. While most of ASLR requires no changes in
   userland, randomizing the main executable's base address presents a
   challenge as traditionally such ELF executables of the ET_EXEC kind
   do not contain enough relocation information. Nevertheless, PaX provides
   two ways to solve this problem: RANDEXEC and RANDMMAP. </p>

   <p>RANDEXEC works by mapping the ET_EXEC ELF file in a special way in memory
   and requires no changes in userland (except for actually enabling it on
   a given file, as this feature is disabled by default). The drawback of
   this approach is that it is slow (the kernel compilation benchmark sees
   a 3 times slow down for example) and prone to false positive detections
   of so-called return-to-libc style attacks (which renders it unusable on
   such executables). </p> 
   
   <warn>Therefore this method mainly exists to prove a point
   and is not intended for production use.</warn>

   <p>RANDMMAP on the other hand works on ELF files of the ET_DYN kind which is
   normally used for dynamically linkable libraries. This approach has none
   of the drawbacks that plague RANDEXEC because such ET_DYN ELF files have
   enough relocation information and the dynamic linker has no problem with
   relocating them (and there is no performance penalty at runtime), nor is
   there a chance for false positive attack detections as none is done in the
   first place. This means that protecting against the return-to-libc style
   attack (in case the information about the randomization can leak to the
   attacker) requires other approaches, which is not discussed here.</p>

   <p>It should be clear by now that the preferable way of randomizing the main
   executable's base address is via RANDMMAP and not RANDEXEC. This in turn
   means that we need a way to produce ET_DYN ELF executables instead of the
   ET_EXEC kind. The following parts describe the process in detail and
   hopefully provide enough information so that modifying existing packages
   to produce ET_DYN ELF targets will not be a problem. Software authors
   and/or package maintainers are encouraged to provide such make targets
   themselves in the future.</p>

<chapter>
	<title>How to produce ET_DYN ELF executables</title>
	<body>

   <p>The following discussion assumes that the GNU toolchain (such as gcc and
   ld) is used to produce the target file, other languages and tools should
   follow the same principles however. The process has two main steps, first
   compilation then linking, both of which need to be modified for producing
   an ET_DYN ELF executable.</p>

   <p>Compilation has to be modified in order to produce position independent
   code (PIC) which in turn allows the linker to not emit so-called text
   relocations in the final ET_DYN ELF file. Although this step is not
   strictly required (it does not affect the relocatability of the result),
   it is useful as this allows for another security related hardening: PaX
   normally makes it impossible to make an executable file mapping writable,
   however for text relocations it has to make an exception. If there are
   no such ET_DYN ELF files on a system, this exception can be removed and
   then the only way to introduce new executable code into a task's address
   space will be via file creation and mapping (which can be prevented by
   other methods such as ACL systems). Producing PIC is very easy, one just
   has to add the -fPIC switch to the compiler command line. This will not
   get rid of all text relocations however as there are other sources of
   (position dependent) code contributing to the final ET_DYN ELF file that
   will lead us to the next step.</p>
   
   <p>Linking the main executable is governed by a special script called the
   'specs' file ('gcc -v' tells us what is used by default). Studying it in
   detail is beyond our scope, but let's note the fact that there are more
   object files linked into the result than one has specified on the linker
   command line. These extra objects are necessary for implementing such
   features as calling constructors/destructors or the low-level entry point
   of the code (the main() C function is not the actual entry point of an ELF
   executable). </p>

   <p>Linking an ET_DYN ELF file is initiated by specifying the -shared switch
   on the gcc command line which in turn will affect what extra object files
   go into the result. Since our actual goal is to produce the main executable
   (vs. a shared library), we have to make sure that we link in all extra
   objects normally expected by an ET_EXEC target and not necessarily those
   specified by the specs file for libraries. Luckily there is only one extra
   object we have to take care of: crt1.o (we will ignore profiling and not
   care about gcrt1.o). It is no coincidence that crt1.o is not linked into
   shared libraries as this object contains (among others) the low-level entry
   point and startup code that invokes the C library startup code which in
   turn calls main(). 
   <warn>Initiating the building of ET_DYN executables on Gentoo does not require us to put -shared in our CFLAGS or LDFLAGS</warn></p>

   <p>Making crt1.o position independent is easy, we just have to make use of the
   GOT (in keeping with the tradition of the glibc naming convention for the
   position independent version of the extra object files, we will call it
   crt1S.o). There is one last issue to take care of: a dynamically linked
   executable requires a special program header that specifies the dynamic
   linker to be mapped into memory by the kernel on task creation. As we can
   see it from the specs file, having the -shared switch on the linker command
   line will omit the dynamic linker specification and would produce an
   unusable ET_DYN ELF file. The solution is simple, we follow the approach
   of glibc which is also an executable ET_DYN ELF file: the dynamic linker
   is specified in an object file that contains the full path to the dynamic
   linker in a specific ELF section that ld will recognize and convert into
   the corresponding program header.</p>

   <p>The above method is demonstrated on a simple 'hello world' program that
   is included with this document. The source code of the main executable
   is in a.c, our PIC crt1 is in crt1S.S (it has to be written in assembly,
   the code is directly derived from glibc 2.2) and finally interp.c defines
   the dynamic linker (technically it could be put into crt1S.S as well to
   reduce the number of extra files to a minimum). The makefile is very
   simple as well, it compiles each source file into an object file and then
   links them together. One important thing to note is the order of the
   object files on the linker command line: crt1S.o must come first (that is,
   before any object file of the application) and interp.o should follow it
   directly as this will result in the interpreter program header getting
   emitted before the PT_LOAD headers (which is the normal program header
   ordering in ET_EXEC files, although it is not strictly necessary). Since
   crt1S.o and interp.o are constant (they do not depend on the application
   code) they can be compiled once and put into the same directory where
   the other systemwide crt* files are.</p>

	<title>ET_DYN ELF executables (The Gentoo Way)</title>
	<body>

   <p>On Gentoo this is accomplished by merging <i>hardened-gcc</i>: </p>

   <pre caption = "Emerging hardened-gcc">
<c># emerge hardened-gcc</c>
</pre>
   
   <p><i>hardened-gcc</i> is an umbrella package for non-mainstream gcc modifications
   The <i>hardened-gcc</i> packages was initially created by Alexander Gabert 
   for this special purpose we are serving here: rolling out the etdyn
   specs file and interp.o together with the position independent
   crt1S.o.  But this package is not limited to that purpose.  
   It was designed to be the be used for any future changes to gentoo-hardened systems 
   regarding the improvement of gcc compiling binaries that are more secure 
   than the default product coming out when the vanilla gcc is used. And it can be used for ebuild packages to
   "trigger" some alternative action once they "realize" that they are
   getting built on a system equipped with a modified gcc for enforcing
   gentoo hardened protection measures. Straight this means that when a
   package is found to be breaking when used with the hardened-gcc changes,
   the particular ebuild of that failing package can and will be modified
   by our gentoo-hardened developers to put some "check" logic into it when
   the hardened-gcc is found on the target system. </p>

   <p>As an example lets try the rebuilding our chpax binary as an ET_DYN
   shared executable. We can use the file(1) command to determine if we 
   in fact we are building our executables as ET_EXEC or ET_DYN.</p> 
   
   <p>The first example here we have chpax built as an ET_DYN and the second 
   one is chpax built as an ET_EXEC.</p>

	<pre caption = "Example files">
<c># file /sbin/chpax</c>
/sbin/chpax: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 \
(GNU/Linux), stripped

GNU/Linux 2.0.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped

<comment>To keep the bugs down for us we really dont want the
end user mucking with the specs -solar </comment>
<comment>
   <p>We can further simplify the building of ET_DYN executables by modifying
   a few sections of the default gcc specs file as demonstrated in the
   specs.2.95.3 and specs.3.2.3 files (for the respective gcc versions).
   To use the new specs file we can either replace the default one or pass
   it on the gcc command line via the -specs switch (in the latter case we
   could further trim down the new specs file and keep only the sections
   that we changed: *cpp, *cc1, *endfile, *link and *startfile). From now
   on invoking gcc as 'gcc -et_dyn' will produce an ET_DYN executable (the
   same goes for g++).</p>

   <p>Readers interested in rebuilding entire distributions are encouraged to
   take a look at the Adamantix (http://www.adamantix.org) and Hardened
   Gentoo projects (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/).</p>
