<title>Introduction</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
With the rise of mainstream consumer machines with hardware stack protection 
(e.g. the <uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit">NX bit</uri> on 
amd64), we developers have to be doubly sure that our packages build with the 
correct stack settings.  Keep in mind that stack protection is an issue for all 
architectures, not just x86 or amd64.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this document is to help package maintainers fix their packages 
when they break.  We will be focusing our attention on the GNU_STACK ELF 
marking.  ELF is simply a file format which all modern linux distros use.  An 
ELF can be an executable (say <path>/bin/ls</path>) or a library (say 
<path>/lib/libncurses.so</path>).  GNU_STACK is just an ELF program header 
which tells the system how to control the stack when the ELF is loaded into 
memory.
</p>

<p>
Before getting started, you should read through the Wikipedia entry on the 
<uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit">NX bit</uri>.  You can skip it 
of course if you're already familiar with the concept of executable versus 
non-executable stacks.

<chapter>
<title>Causes of executable stack markings</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
ELF files end up with executable stack markings in one of three ways:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>GCC generates code that uses executable stack</li>
 <li>an object built from assembler source includes a marking indicating to
     the linker that it needs an executable stack (the GNU-stack note set for
     executable stack)</li>
 <li>an object built from assembler source is missing the GNU-stack note;
     a very common occurrence especially for code expected to work on
     many platforms</li>
</ol>

<p>
GCC generates code to be executed on the stack when it implements a 
<uri link="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Trampolines.html">trampoline 
for nested functions</uri>.  To remove the need for an executable stack in 
this case, it is necessary to rewrite the code another way.  Sometimes this 
is relatively easy, other times not.
</p>

<p>
If an assembler source file includes a GNU-stack note that indicates it needs
an executable stack, presumably this is by design.  Again, in order to remove 
the need for an executable stack, the code probably needs to be rewritten.
</p>

<p>
If an assembler source contains no GNU-stack note, the system by default 
assumes that an executable stack may be required.  However, usually if there's 
no GNU-stack note, this is simply because the author didn't include one, 
rather than the code actually needing an executable stack.
</p>

<p>
In the first two cases above, the executable stack marking is correct, and 
should only be removed by rewriting the code to eliminate the executable 
stack requirement.  Such rewriting has to be considered on a case-by-case 
basis and is outside the scope of this document, at least for now.  Here we 
focus on the third case, where the upstream author has not indicated whether 
the assembler object needs an executable stack; fixing this means adding the 
GNU-stack note to the source to indicate an executable stack is not necessary.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Finding ELFs that ask for an executable stack</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Before you can start fixing something, you have to make sure it's broken first, 
right?  For this reason, we've developed a suite of tools named <uri 
link="doc/en/draft/pax-utils.xml">PaX Utilities</uri>.  If you are not 
familiar with these utilities, you should read the <uri 
link="doc/en/draft/pax-utils.xml">PaX Utilities Guide</uri> now.  Gentoo users 
can simply do <c>emerge pax-utils</c>.  Non-Gentoo users should be able to 
find a copy of the source tarball in the <path>distfiles</path> on a <uri 
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">Gentoo Mirror</uri>.  Once you have the PaX 
Utilities setup on your system, we can start playing around with 
<c>scanelf</c>.
</p>

<p>
Let's see if your system has any ELFs that want an executable stack.
</p>

<pre caption="Scan your system">
$ <i>scanelf -lpqe</i>
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/opengl/xorg-x11/lib/libGL.so.1.2
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libmp.so.3.1.7
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0.7.2
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libsmpeg-0.4.so.0.1.3
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libImlib2.so.1.2.0
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libOSMesa.so.4.0
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libxvidcore.so.4.1
RWX --- ---  /usr/lib/libgmp.so.3.3.3
RWX --- ---  /usr/bin/mencoder
RWX --- ---  /usr/bin/Xorg
RWX --- ---  /usr/bin/mplayer
</pre>

<p>
We really only need to look at the first column (which corresponds to the ELF 
GNU_STACK markings).  Most of the time, if we fix that field, all the others 
fall into place.  As we can see above, many files are marked with an 
executable stack (<e>RWX</e>).  We want to make sure all files are marked 
with <e>RW-</e>.  The large majority of the time this means the package was 
compiled incorrectly, so not much will have to be done with patching up the 
source code.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>What needs to be fixed</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
We now know what files need to be fixed, but what source files are causing 
this breakage?  The only way to find this out is to compile the package and 
analyze the object files before they are combined into the final executable or 
library.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Fixing smpeg</title>
<body>

<p>
So we first have to compile smpeg before we can analyze it.
</p>

<pre caption="Compiling smpeg">
$ <i>ebuild /usr/portage/media-libs/smpeg/smpeg-0.4.4-r6.ebuild clean unpack compile</i>
$ <i>cd /var/tmp/portage/smpeg-0.4.4-r6/work/smpeg-0.4.4/</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we need to look at each object file and see if it has a 
<e>.note.GNU-stack</e> ELF section.  Chances are, the object which is causing 
us trouble lacks this section completely.  In that case, the compiler will 
assume that the ELF should not be restricted at all and mark it as <e>RWX</e>.
The <c>scanelf</c> utility will display output slightly different when
presented with an object that is missing the ELF section.  The <b>!WX</b>
below means that "Oh no, the GNU-stack is missing and write/execute permissions
will be used by default!"
</p>

<pre caption="Locate missing .note.GNU-stack sections">
$ <i>scanelf -qeR .</i>
!WX --- ---  ./video/mmxflags_asm.o
!WX --- ---  ./video/mmxflags_asm.lo
!WX --- ---  ./video/mmxidct_asm.o
!WX --- ---  ./video/mmxidct_asm.lo
</pre>

<p>
Sure enough, these objects lack the <e>.note.GNU-stack</e> ELF section and 
they are linked into the final <path>libsmpeg.so</path> library.  If we were 
to patch the source files <path>video/mmxflags_asm.S</path> and 
<path>video/mmxidct_asm.S</path> so that they contain <e>.note.GNU-stack</e>, 
everything would be peachy.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Check objects by hand</title>
<body>

<p>
For fun, lets see how we could use the more common <c>readelf</c> utility
(which is part of the <e>binutils</e> package).
</p>

<pre caption="Using readelf">
<comment>This is what the output should look like, notice the .note.GNU-stack line</comment>

<title>How to fix the stack (in theory)</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
When you compile source code normally, gcc takes care of adding the GNU_STACK 
markings so that the final object code is not marked with an executable 
stack unless it actually needs it.  However, if you compile assembly code,
gcc will not automatically add GNU_STACK markings.  So, the most common source
of executable stacks in ELF binaries are packages which include raw assembly
code.  Note that we're not talking about inline assembly code, but rather
files like <e>.S</e> which are written in pure assembler.
</p>

<p>
We can either patch each source file written in assembler and send the fixes 
upstream, or we can be lazy and simply force the package build system to 
assemble the source files with the GNU as option <e>--noexecstack</e> (but 
this is highly discouraged).
</p>

<p>
The advantage to patching the code is that it's easy to do, it's portable, 
and we can usually convince upstream to add it to their packages with little 
fuss.  The disadvantage to patching is that we may have to patch many many 
files.
</p>

<p>
The advantage to just using <e>--noexecstack</e> is that you can simply add it 
to your ebuild and be done.  The disadvantage is that the option isn't very 
portable (it won't work with non-GNU systems, and it probably won't even 
work with all GNU systems), and we can't really convince upstream to make this 
change.  Thus, the only people who see the benefit here is Gentoo users.  You 
gotta think big baby!

<title>Patching</title>
<body>

<p>
The great thing about patching is that you can copy and paste this stuff 
everywhere.  Just make sure the code will be preprocessed (e.g. the source 
file is named with <e>.S</e> and not <e>.s</e>).  Stick these code snippets 
at the end of the source file, recompile, and do a jig.

<title>Compiling with --noexecstack</title>
<body>

<p>
Often times you only need to add the following code in your ebuild.  You must 
first be sure that the code does not actually require an executable stack as 
forcing this flag will break the package otherwise.
</p>

<impo>
Please rethink patching before using this option.  Patching source code 
benefits a lot more people which is the goal of OSS.

On the off chance that you cannot assemble the files, you can tell the linker
to disable execstack stack.
