</description>

<longdescription>
  Hardened Gentoo is an umbrella project which oversees the research, implementation, and maintainence of
  security oriented projects for Gentoo Linux. We are a team of very competent individuals dedicated
  to bringing advanced security to Gentoo with a number of subprojects.
</longdescription>

<goals>
  Hardened Gentoo&#39;s purpose is to make Gentoo viable for high security,
  high stability production server environments. This project is not a 
  standalone project disjoined from Gentoo proper; it is intended
  to be a team of Gentoo developers which are focused on delivering solutions
  to Gentoo that provide strong security and stability. These solutions will be
  available in Gentoo once they&#39;ve been tested for security and stability
  by the Hardened team.
