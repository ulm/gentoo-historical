<title>About this document</title>
<body>

<p>
This document will give an overview of all SELinux documented changes made
on particular dates and that might be important for users to follow up through.
</p>

<p>
Changes that only affect ~arch users will be documented below and moved up when
they are stabilized. It is possible though that these changes will be "fixed"
automatically and as such removed from this page.

<title>Overview of Changes for Stable Users</title>
<subsection>
<title>2012/06/24 - Definition of /run in fstab</title>
<body>

<p>
The <path>/run</path> location needs to be mounted with the <c>var_run_t</c>
context. To do so, <path>/etc/fstab</path> needs to be modified as per the
instructions in <uri link="?part=2&amp;chap=1#doc_chap1_sect4">Setting the
filesystem contexts</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2012/05/26 - Support of initramfs</title>
<body>

<p>
Users who boot with an initramfs will need to boot in permissive mode first, and
later on switch to enforcing mode. This can be done automatically using an
init script, as documented at <uri
link="/proj/en/hardened/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml?part=2&amp;chap=2#doc_chap5">Initramfs
users</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2012/05/26 - Support for graphical login managers</title>
<body>

<p>
Users who boot into a graphical environment (such as through GDM) will need to
edit their PAM configuration files accordingly to support SELinux security
context settings. This is documented at <uri
link="/proj/en/hardened/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml?part=2&amp;chap=2#doc_chap5">Users
of a graphical environment</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2012/05/18 - No more sandbox configuration needed</title>
<body>

<p>
The previously documented editing of <path>/etc/sandbox.conf</path> to open
write access to <path>/sys/fs/selinux/context</path> can be removed as the
SELinux profile does this now automatically.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2012/04/29 - Edit of lvm-start/stop scripts no longer needed</title>
<body>

<p>
When users install the newly stabilized 2.20120215 policies, the documented
editing of <path>/lib/rcscripts/addons/lvm-st*.sh</path> is no longer needed.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2012/02/21 - /dev mount line in fstab no longer needed</title>
<body>

<p>
The previously documented /dev mount line in <path>/etc/fstab</path> is no
longer needed as <path>util-linux-2.20.1-r1</path> has been marked stable (which
contains the correct bug fix).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2011/12/10 - Deprecation of selinux/v2refpolicy/* profiles</title>
<body>

<p>
The old SELinux profiles (starting with <c>selinux/v2refpolicy</c>) are not
supported anymore. Users are strongly encouraged to switch to the new profiles
(those ending with <c>/selinux</c>).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>2011/07/22 - Introduction of MLS/MCS support</title>
<body>

<p>
We now support MLS and MCS, right next to targeted and strict SELinux policy
types. When using MLS or MCS, you will need to update the <path>/tmp</path>
entry in your <path>/etc/fstab</path> to use
<c>rootcontext=system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0</c> (note the trailing <c>:s0</c>).
