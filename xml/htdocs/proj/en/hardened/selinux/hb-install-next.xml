<p>
Congratulations! You now have a working Gentoo system. But where to go from
here? What are your options now? What to explore first? Gentoo provides its
users with lots of possibilities, and therefore lots of documented (and less
documented) features.
</p>

<p>
You should definately take a look at the next part of the Gentoo Handbook
entitled <uri link="?part=3&amp;chap=0">Working with Gentoo</uri> which explains
how to keep your software up to date, how to install more software, what USE 
flags are, how the Gentoo Init system works, etc.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in optimizing your system for desktop-use, or you want to
learn how to configure your system to be a full working desktop system, consult
our extensive <uri link="/doc/en/desktop.xml">Gentoo Desktop Documentation 
Resources</uri>.
</p>

<p>
For a full listing of all our available documentation check out our <uri
link="/doc/en/index.xml">Documentation Resources</uri> page.
