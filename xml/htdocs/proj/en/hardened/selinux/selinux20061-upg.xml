<title>Gentoo SELinux 2006.1 Upgrade Guide</title>

<author title="Author"><mail link="pebenito@gentoo.org">Chris PeBenito</mail></author>

<abstract>
This guide describes the upgrade path from SELinux 2005.1 to 2006.1.
</abstract>

<version>0.9</version>
<date>5 Sep 2006</date>

<chapter><title>Introduction</title>
<section><body>
<warn>
The hardened profiles are not currently supported due to the unavailability of
hardened glibc 2.4.
</warn>
<impo>
The app-portage/portage-utils package will be needed in this install, please make sure it is installed.
It can be removed at the end of the upgrade.
</impo>
<impo>
This upgrade should be performed in permissive mode as root/sysadm_r.
</impo>
<p>
The 2006.1 SELinux policy is now based on the new SELinux Reference Policy, and new management infrastructure (libsemanage/semodule/semanage).
</p>

<chapter><title>Change to 2006.1 profile</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>First switch your profile to the SELinux profile for your architecture:</p>

<chapter><title>Merge new SELinux userland and base policy</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
  The new policies require current SELinux userland components.
  Also, since the new reference policy has a new portage policy domain (portage_t.merge),
  we must temporarily force portage to use the old domain (portage_t)
  until the new selinux-base-policy is installed.
</p>
<pre caption="Update userland">
# <i>PORTAGE_T="portage_t" emerge -u1 libsepol libselinux libsemanage checkpolicy policycoreutils selinux-base-policy</i>
</pre>

<section><title>Choose the policy type</title>
<body>
<p>
New in 2006.1, users now have the choice between the strict policy and the
targeted policy.
</p>
<p>
The old policy was strict; all processes are confined.  Strict policy is
suggested for servers.  Gentoo does not support the strict policy on desktops.
</p>
<p>
The targeted policy differs with strict, as only network-facing services are
confined and local users are unconfined.  Gentoo only supports desktops with
the targeted policy.  This policy can also be used on servers.
</p>
<p>
Edit the /etc/selinux/config file to set the policy type.
</p>
<pre caption="/etc/selinux/config contents">
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system on boot.

# SELINUX can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=permissive <comment>(This should be set permissive for the remainder of the upgrade)</comment>

# SELINUXTYPE can take one of these two values:
#       targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#       strict - Full SELinux protection.
SELINUXTYPE=strict <comment>(Set this as strict or targeted)</comment>

<p>Merge the updated daemon policies.</p>

<chapter><title>Relabel Reboot Relabel</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
There was a problem with the old portage policies.  When udev was
merged, reference devices made in /lib/udev/devices were not able
to be created, and instead regular files were created.  These should
be removed if they exist.
</p>
<pre caption="Purge udev lib devices">
# <i>rm -f /lib/udev/devices/*</i>
</pre>
<p>
The system will still function correctly, but if you want to be sure,
remerge udev.
</p>
<p>
Relabel the system, then reboot, and log in as root/sysadm_r and relabel the system again.
Since the policy sources are no longer installed, relabeling can be done with the rlpkg tool.
</p>
<pre caption="rlpkg syntax for relabeling the system">
# <i>rlpkg -a -F</i>

<chapter><title>Add user login mappings</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
If you previously had SELinux identities configured in your users file, there
is a new way to manage this, see the <uri link="selinux-handbook.xml?part=3&amp;chap=1#doc_chap3">SELinux Overview</uri>
for more details.

<chapter><title>Conclusion</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
There are several changes with SELinux that have been mentioned in this guide.
Please refer to the <uri link="selinux-handbook.xml">SELinux Handbook</uri> for more information on these features and tools.
