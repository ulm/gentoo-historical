<section><title>Merge SELinux Packages</title>
<subsection>
<body>
<p>Merge the libraries, utilities and base-policy.  The policy version may need
   be adjusted, refer to the SELinux Overview
   for more information on policy versions.  Then load the policy.</p>

<section><title>Choose the policy type</title>
<body>
<p>
New in 2006.1, users now have the choice between the strict policy and the
targeted policy.
</p>
<p>
In the strict policy, all processes are confined.
If you are familiar with pre 2006.1 Gentoo SELinux policy, that policy was a strict policy.
Strict policy is suggested for servers.
Gentoo does not support the strict policy on desktops.
</p>
<p>
The targeted policy differs with strict, as only network-facing services are
confined and local users are unconfined.  Gentoo only supports desktops with
the targeted policy.  This policy can also be used on servers.
</p>
<p>
Edit the /etc/selinux/config file to set the policy type.
</p>
<pre caption="/etc/selinux/config contents">
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system on boot.

# SELINUX can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=permissive <comment>(This should be set permissive for the remainder of the install)</comment>

# SELINUXTYPE can take one of these two values:
#       targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#       strict - Full SELinux protection.
SELINUXTYPE=strict <comment>(Set this as strict or targeted)</comment>

<section><title>Merge SELinux-patched packages</title>
<subsection><body>
<p>
  There are several system packages that have SELinux patches.  These patches
  provide a variety of additional SELinux functionality, such as displaying
  file contexts.
</p>
<pre caption="Remerge Packages">
# <i>emerge sysvinit pam coreutils findutils openssh procps psmisc shadow util-linux python-selinux</i>
</pre>
<note>
  If you find that you can't use portage due to a errors like these:
  !!! 'module' object has no attribute 'secure_rename' or
  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'getcontext', this is
  a portage bug, where it can't handle a missing python-selinux.  Merge it
  with "USE=-selinux emerge python-selinux" to fix the problem.  See
  bug <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122517">#122517</uri>
  for more information.
</note>
<p>There are other packages that have SELinux patches, but are optional.  These
should be remerged if they are already installed, so the SELinux patches are
applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>app-admin/logrotate</li>
<li>sys-apps/fcron</li>
<li>sys-apps/vixie-cron</li>
<li>sys-fs/device-mapper</li>
<li>sys-fs/udev</li>
<li>sys-libs/pwdb</li>
</ul>
<note>
  Fcron and Vixie-cron are the only crons with SELinux support.

<section><title>Merge Application Policies</title>
<subsection><body>
<p>
  In future, when merging a package, the policy will be set as a dependency so
  that it is merged first; however, since the system is being converted, policy
  for currently installed packages must be merged.  The selinux-base-policy
  already covers most packages in the system profile.
</p>
<p>
  Look in the <c>/usr/portage/sec-policy</c>, it has several entries, each which
  represent a policy.  The naming scheme is selinux-PKGNAME, where PKGNAME is
  the name of the package that the policy is associated.  For example, the
  selinux-apache package is the SELinux policy package for net-www/apache.
  Merge each of the needed policy packages and then load the policy.
  If you are converting a desktop, make sure to include the selinux-desktop policy package.
</p>

<section><title>Label Filesystems</title>
<subsection><body>
<p>
  Now label the filesystems.  This gives each of the files in the filesystems
  a security label.  Keeping these labels consistent is important.
</p>
<pre caption="Label filesystems">
# <i>rlpkg -a -r</i>
</pre>
<warn>
  There is a known issue with older versions of GRUB
  not being able to read symlinks that have been labeled.
  Please make sure you have at least GRUB 0.94 installed.
  Also rerun GRUB and reinstall it into the MBR to ensure
  the updated code is in use.
  You do have a LiveCD handy, right?
</warn>
<pre caption="Reinstall GRUB on the MBR (GRUB users only)">
# <i>grub</i>

grub> root (hd0,0) <comment>(Your boot partition)</comment>
grub> setup (hd0) <comment>(Where the boot record is installed; here, it is the MBR)</comment>
</pre>
</body></subsection>
</section>

<section><title>Final reboot</title>
<subsection><body>
<p>Reboot.  Log in, then relabel again to ensure all files
are labeled correctly (some files may have been created during shutdown and
reboot)</p>
<pre caption="Relabel">
# <i>rlpkg -a -r</i>
</pre>
<note>
  It is strongly suggested to <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">subscribe</uri>
  to the gentoo-hardened mail list.  It is generally a low traffic list, and 
  SELinux announcements are made there.
</note>
<p>
  SELinux is now installed!
