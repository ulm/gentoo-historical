<title>SELinux Policy Language</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
By default, Gentoo provides a generic, yet tightly controlled policy which is
deemed a good start policy for the majority of users. However, the purpose
behind a Mandatory Access Control system is to put the security administrator in
control. As such, a handbook on SELinux without information on how to write
policies wouldn't be complete.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we'll talk a bit about the language behind SELinux policies and
give some pointers on how to create your own policies, roles, etc.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Building a SELinux Module</title>
<body>

<p>
First, before we go into the art of SELinux policy writing, let's first make a
small SELinux module with a rule we can test, build the module and see if things
work. Although these steps are fairly easy, they are important nonetheless.
Modifying the SELinux policy as offered by Gentoo is best done through
additional SELinux policy modules. Only when the core policy (the base policy)
is not to your liking should you see on using a totally different policy.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with a skeleton for a policy module we'll call <e>testmod</e>. You
should use simple names for the modules as the build infrastructure is quite
sensitive to special constructs. Use only letters a-z and numbers, and never
start a module name with a number.
</p>

<pre caption="Policy module skeleton">
policy_module(testmod, 1.0.0)
</pre>

<p>
Yes, that's it. But as you can see, it is fairly empty. So let's add a rule that
allows a regular user (in the user_t domain) to read ebuild files (of type
portage_ebuild_t).
</p>

<pre caption="Policy module testmod">
policy_module(testmod, 1.0.0)

require {
  type user_t;
  type portage_ebuild_t;
  class file { read open getattr };
  class dir { read search open getattr };
}

allow user_t portage_ebuild_t:file { read open getattr };
allow user_t portage_ebuild_t:dir { read search open getattr };
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, something as simple as allowing a user to read a file requires
quite a few privileges. The directory privileges are needed to allow a user to
navigate through the Portage tree structure whereas the file privileges are
needed for a user to be able to access and open the ebuilds. Save this file as
<path>testmod.te</path>.
</p>

<p>
To build the policy and convert it into the binary module that we can load into
the SELinux policy store, we can use the <path>Makefile</path> available in
<path>/usr/share/selinux/strict/include</path> (substitute strict with the
SELinux policy type you are using).
</p>

<pre caption="Building a binary policy module">
$ <i>make -f /usr/share/selinux/struct/include/Makefile testmod.pp</i>
</pre>

<p>
The filename (<path>testmod.pp</path>) is the destination binary SELinux module
name. The <path>Makefile</path> will automatically look for the
<path>testmod.te</path> file you have in the working directory.
</p>

<p>
As a result, you should now have a file called <path>testmod.pp</path>. This
module file can now be loaded in the SELinux policy store as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading a binary module">
# <i>semodule -i /path/to/testmod.pp</i>
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations! You have now build your first SELinux policy module. If you
want to disable it, remove it through <c>semodule -r testmod</c>.
</p>

<p>
This method of building a policy (using the <path>Makefile</path> and
<c>semodule</c>) is something that you will need to do every time you want to
update the SELinux policy on your system. The contents of the policy however
does change as we will see in the rest of this document.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Getting the SELinux Policy Interfaces</title>
<body>

<p>
To streamline policy development, the SELinux policy based on the reference
policy uses interfaces to access privileges within a module. If you have built
<path>selinux-base-policy</path> with <c>USE="doc"</c> then this information is
available at
<path>/usr/share/doc/selinux-base-policy-&lt;version&gt;/html</path>. It is
recommended to have this information at hand, since most policy
development/updates will be done through the interfaces offered by the policy.
</p>

<p>
If you are just interested, you can also find these interface definitions <uri
link="http://oss.tresys.com/docs/refpolicy/api/">online</uri>. Mind you though,
the online resource is only the reference policy and might differ a bit from the
policy available within Gentoo.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Using Policy Interfaces</title>
<body>

<p>
Using the policy interfaces allows you to update the policy with more readable
functions. For instance, to allow the user_t domain to call and use Portage
applications, the module could look like so:
</p>

<pre caption="Example policy to allow user_t to use portage">
policy_module(testmod, 1.0.0)

require {
  type user_t;
  role user_r;
}

portage_run(user_t, user_r)
</pre>

<p>
Of course, this makes the user_t domain much more privileged than the previously
defined rules to read ebuild files: it allows the user to call portage, update
the system, etc. Of course, the user still requires the proper regular Linux
permissions (so he needs to be part of the portage group or become root).
Needless to say, we do not recommend to grant this to a regular user ;-)
</p>

<section>
<title>Full SELinux Policy Modules</title>
<subsection>
<title>Checking Out an Isolated Module</title>
<body>

<p>
With the above in mind, we can now go one step further and investigate a full
policy module, with both the type enforcement rules (<path>.te</path> file),
file contexts (<path>.fc</path>) and interfaces (<path>.if</path>).
</p>

<p>
You should know that writing a module requires you to get intimate with the
application. It isn't a matter of just hoping for the best: as a security
administrator, you will be responsible for defining what accesses are allowed
and which not. If you forget one, the application might break under the users'
hands. But if you add too much, you might grant privileges that can be abused
later on. And it will be a lot more difficult to track and remove privileges
later as you will be hesitating if the privilege is needed or not.
</p>

<p>
In this section, we will not divulge in how to write one. We have an excellent
<uri link="/proj/en/hardened/selinux-development.xml">Gentoo Hardened SELinux
Development</uri> resource that guides you in that. However, we will look into
such a full module to explain the other aspects of policy development.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Type Enforcement File</title>
<body>

<p>
The <path>.te</path> file we wrote earlier is a <e>type enforcement file</e>.
Its purpose is to define the access rules related to the module that you are
building, but also - and more importantly - define new types (or even roles).
</p>

<p>
The example below is a snippet from a module for the skype application.
</p>

<pre caption="Snippet from skype.te">
policy_module(skype, 1.0.0)

type skype_t;
type skype_exec_t;
application_domain(skype_t, skype_exec_t)

type skype_home_t;
userdom_user_home_content(skype_home_t)

manage_dirs_pattern(skype_t, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)
manage_files_pattern(skype_t, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, three new types are declared: <c>skype_t</c> (which will
be used for the application), <c>skype_exec_t</c> (which is the label given to
the application binary) and <c>skype_home_t</c> (which will be used for the
users' <path>~/.Skype</path> location). Also, the <c>skype_t</c> domain is given
some privileges with respect to the <c>skype_home_t</c> label (manage
directories and files).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>File Context File</title>
<body>

<p>
In the <path>.fc</path> file (which stands for <e>file context file</e>) the
module's resources (files, directories, sockets, ...) are defined. Once the
module is loaded, these rules are added so that file system relabeling will put
the correct context on the files.
</p>

<p>
The example below is a snippet from the skype modules' file context file.
</p>

<pre caption="Snippet from skype.fc">
HOME_DIR/\.Skype(/.*)?    gen_context(system_u:object_r:skype_home_t,s0)
/opt/skype/skype       -- gen_context(system_u:object_r:skype_exec_t,s0)
/usr/bin/skype         -- gen_context(system_u:object_r:skype_exec_t,s0)
</pre>

<p>
The format of the file context file has the following syntax:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The regular expression that matches the file(s) and directorie(s) affected
    by that line
  </li>
  <li>
    An optional identifier to differentiate the type of files (file, directory,
    socket, symbolic link, ...)
  </li>
  <li>
    A <c>gen_context</c> line that contains the context to assign to the file(s)
    and directorie(s)
  </li>
</ol>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Interface File</title>
<body>

<p>
In the <path>.if</path> file (for <e>interface file</e>) interfaces are declared
which can be used by other modules. It is through interfaces that a nicely
defined policy can be built on top of other, existing policy modules.
</p>

<p>
One interface could be to allow users to call and execute an application. For
instance, the following interface can be found in the skype module.
</p>

<pre caption="Snippet from skype.if">
interface(`skype_role',`
        gen_require(`
                type skype_t, skype_exec_t, skype_tmpfs_t, skype_home_t;
        ')

        role $1 types skype_t;

        domtrans_pattern($2, skype_exec_t, skype_t)

        allow $2 skype_t:process { ptrace signal_perms };

        manage_dirs_pattern($2, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)
        manage_files_pattern($2, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)
        manage_lnk_files_pattern($2, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)

        relabel_dirs_pattern($2, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)
        relabel_files_pattern($2, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)
        relabel_lnk_files_pattern($2, skype_home_t, skype_home_t)

        ps_process_pattern($2, skype_t)
')
</pre>

<p>
Through this <c>skype_role</c>, we can then allow users to call skype, as can be
found in the <path>unprivuser.te</path> file (which defines the user_t domain):
</p>

<pre caption="Snippet from unprivuser.te to call skype">
optional_policy(`
	skype_role(user_r, user_t)
')
</pre>

<title>Using audit2allow</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
When reading online resources on SELinux, you will notice that there are many
references to a tool called <c>audit2allow</c>. This tools' purpose is to read
AVC denial messages from the audit log file and transform them into a policy
module that you can load. The advantage is that it makes it a lot easier to
write policies. The downside is that the output (unless you use the <c>-R</c>
option) is not usable for the <path>Makefile</path> we used earlier to build
modules.
</p>

<p>
Another disadvantage is that the tool does not intelligently cope with changes.
It blindly accepts denials and treats them as if they need to be allowed, rather
than investigate if no other context should be given to the file, etc.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Using audit2allow</title>
<body>

<p>
Using <c>audit2allow</c> is pretty straightforward. You send it the denials you
want to fix and store the result in a <path>.te</path> file. You then convert it
into an intermediary format which can then be translated into a <path>.pp</path>
file for final loading by <c>semodule</c>.
</p>

<p>
For instance, to catch all denials and transform them into allowed statements
from firefox-related denials:
</p>

<pre caption="Generate a new policy using audit2allow">
# <i>grep firefox /var/log/avc.log | audit2allow -m firefoxmod &gt; firefoxmod.te</i>
# <i>checkmodule -m -o firefoxmod.mod firefoxmod.te</i>
# <i>semodule_package -o firefoxmod.pp -m firefoxmod.mod</i>
# <i>semodule -i firefoxmod.pp</i>
</pre>

<p>
Keep the module name (given through the <c>-m</c> option) simple: only use
characters (<c>[a-z]</c>) and numbers (<c>[0-9]</c>), and start the module name
with a character.
</p>
