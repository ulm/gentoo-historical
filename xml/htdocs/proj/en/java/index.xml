The Java Project handles all Gentoo-related Java things.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
The Java Team maintains most packages related to Java development in the 
Portage tree, which at the present time of writing encompass over 350 
different packages.
</p>

<p>
Highlights include the Apache Java Projects, 
JDK/JREs from <uri link="http://www.blackdown.org/">Blackdown</uri>, <uri link="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Sun</uri>, 
<uri link="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/">IBM</uri>, <uri link="http://h18012.www1.hp.com/java/">Compaq</uri>, 
<uri link="http://www.jrockit.com/">BEA</uri>, and of course <uri link="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</uri>. 

We also package some alternative languages for the JVM, 
such as <uri link="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</uri>, <uri link="http://jruby.sourceforge.net/">JRuby</uri>, and <uri link="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</uri>. 

We package IDEs such as <uri link="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</uri>, and <uri link="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</uri>. 
And of course, there is a wide variety of Java libraries and applications.

<title>Call for help!</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
  We are always looking for more help. We barely have enough
  manpower to maintain our 350+ packages. Not to mention packages that 
  require a dedicated maintainer like Eclipse, Netbeans, Tomcat, Resin, 
  and several others that are no longer in true for this very reason. 
  Specifically JBoss and Jetty. Others like Glassfish, Jasper Reports, 
  OpenJDK/IcedTea, etc.
</p>

<p> 
  On top of all that we need time and energy to extend our offering into new
  areas. Such as natively compiled Java packages using gcj, providing an all
  open source from source Java vm, developing a framework for packaging
  webapps, packaging popular webapps themselves, or creation of a stable and
  complete J2EE development platform.  
</p>

<p>
  There are lots of areas we are in need. We are always seeking new team 
  members, be it contributors or developers. All efforts are voluntary. 
  We do not assign tasks or do much deligation of duties. Pretty much 
  jump in and start helping out is our motto.
</p>
	
<p>
  If you have any interest in helping please read 
  <uri link="getting-involved.xml">Getting Involved</uri>. Then get moving on
  the ideas suggested in that document. The Java Team members are more 
  than happy to help at any point along the way.
