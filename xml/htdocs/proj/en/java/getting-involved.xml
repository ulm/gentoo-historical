          The most obvious way to help out is with development. This means 
          improving existing ebuilds, updating ebuilds for new versions of 
          packages, and working on ebuilds for new packages.

      <title>Reporting</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Software is bound to have bugs. Reporting bugs found is very 
          important, because there may be some USE cases or scenarios that 
          developers may not have accounted for. Without reporting the 
          bugs might go unnoticed and never be fixed. Leaving it for 
          others to run into just as you have.

        <p>
          The number of open bugs assigned to the Java team is a bit 
          astounding. Any help with squashing them is always appreciated.

          Hang around #gentoo-java. It small, yet bustling little channel in 
          our corner of freenode. The primary developers of Java on Gentoo are 
          there most of the time. The channel is like the pulse of the Java 
          team, where most interaction takes place. This means you'll see 
          development as it is happening.

          Simply being around showing support is nice. Contributing to 
          discussions that come up, or troubleshooting bugs that arise would 
          be even better.
