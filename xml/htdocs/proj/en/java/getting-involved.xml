          involved and help out with the Gentoo Java Project. The following
          are ideas of areas and ways one can help out. Due to the volume of
          inquiries at times. It's more effective and efficient to provide

            <ul>
              <li>
                Compile them with a bunch of jdks (at least stable marked 
                ibm-jdk-bin and sun-jdk versions should be installed locally).
				Here's a simple script to 
                <uri link="http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/java/browser/scripts/compile-with-all-jdks">compile with all jdks</uri>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                Check with USE="doc" that javadocs install to 
                <path>/usr/share/doc/${PF}/html/api</path>
                If the ebuild installs them elsewhere for example to keep html 
                documentation links working, there should still be a symlink
              </li>
              <li>
                run <c>FEATURES="test" USE="test" ebuild &lt;ebuild&gt; clean install</c>
                (not all java packages have unit tests)
              </li>
              <li>
                compile all reverse dependencies if we are talking about a 
                version bump (<c>!rdep &lt;pkg&gt;</c> to jeeves on IRC for example)
              </li>
              <li>
                Check
                <uri link="http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/java/browser/testcases">source:testcases</uri> 
                if the package has testcases in our svn.

          The most obvious way to help out is with development. This means 
          improving existing ebuilds, updating ebuilds for new versions of 
          packages, and working on ebuilds for new packages.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create ebuilds for ebuild request bugs or for packages you use
                and/or need packaged. Attaching contributed ebuild and/or patch
                as an attachment to any bugs.
              </li>
              <li>
                File bugs with patches attached for any existing ebuilds that
                are outdated and/or need to be bumped to the latest release.
              </li>
              <li>
                Test out contribute to completing packages in java overlays.
                Usually java-experimental overlay which is not available 
                via layman. It must be checked out manually.
              </li>

      <title>Reporting</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Software is bound to have bugs. Reporting bugs found is very 
          important, because there may be some USE cases or scenarios that 
          developers may not have accounted for. Without reporting the 
          bugs might go unnoticed and never be fixed. Leaving it for 
          others to run into just as you have.

          The number of open bugs assigned to the Java team is a bit 
          astounding. Any help with squashing them is always appreciated.

          Hang around #gentoo-java. It small, yet bustling little channel in 
          our corner of freenode. The primary developers of Java on Gentoo are 
          there most of the time. The channel is like the pulse of the Java 
          team, where most interaction takes place. This means you'll see 
          development as it is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply being around showing support is nice. Contributing to 
          discussions that come up, or troubleshooting bugs that arise would 
          be even better.
