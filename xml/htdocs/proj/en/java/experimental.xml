  <p>
	Our development of new and exciting stuff is done in the experimental Java 
	subversion repository. You can find it at <uri>https://svn.gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/</uri>.
    If you would like to make a checkout of one of these projects, you will,
	of course, have to emerge subversion.

<title>Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
  <p>The Java team has several overlays, each with their own purpose</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Experimental Overlay</title>
<body>
      
  <p>
    The purpose of this experimental overlay is to serve as a sandbox 
	for exciting new packages which aren't quite ready for prime-time.
    Some highlights of this overlay include:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  modularized <uri link="http://www.jboss.com">JBoss</uri> packages</li>
	<li>
	  <uri link="http://www.springframework.org">the Spring framework</uri>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <uri link="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</uri> built from source.
	</li>
  </ul>

  <pre caption="Check out the experimental overlay"> 
# mkdir -p /usr/local/overlays/java-experimental
# svn co https://svn.gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/gentoo-java-experimental /usr/local/overlays/java-experimental
<comment>Edit /etc/make.conf and add /usr/local/overlays/java-experimental to PORTDIR_OVERLAY,
i.e. PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${PORTDIR_OVERLAY} /usr/local/overlays/java-experimental"</comment></pre>

  <p>
    Now you should be all set to emerge packages from the experimental tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also update the overlay from time to time.
  </p>
  
<pre caption="Update the experimental overlay">
# cd /usr/local/overlays/java-experimental
# svn update</pre>

<section>
<title>Java 1.5 Overlay (aka Migration Overlay)</title>
<body>

  <p>
    The purpose of this overlay is ultimately unmask Java 1.5. Essentially, 
    we have a new system for building Java packages that would allow this. 
    The overlay contains the glue that will allow us to migrate from the 
    existing system to the new one.
    Please refer to the <uri link="/proj/en/java/tiger-faq.xml#doc_chap3">Java 1.5 
	FAQ</uri> for full details.

  <section>
  <title>Eclipse Plugin Overlay</title>
  <body>
    
  <p>
    One of our users, Chewi, made huge changes to the eclipse eclass. We are 
	now able to build most of the Eclipse plugins which are only in portage 
	as binary packages from source, instead of relying on binary packages.
    <uri link="https://svn.gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/chewi-overlay/">chewi-overlay</uri>.
    He also has a <uri link="https://svn.gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/chewi-overlay/README.txt">README</uri> explaining the changes.
  </p>

  <note>Some of the plugins in this overlay require packages only found in the experimental overlay!</note>

  <pre caption="Check out the Eclipse overlay">
# mkdir -p /usr/local/overlays/chewi-overlay
# svn co https://svn.gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/chewi-overlay /usr/local/overlays/chewi-overlay
<comment>Edit /etc/make.conf and add /usr/local/overlays/chewi-overlay to PORTDIR_OVERLAY,
i.e. PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${PORTDIR_OVERLAY} /usr/local/overlays/chewi-overlay"</comment></pre>

  <p>You should also update the overlay occaisionally.</p>
<pre caption="Update the Eclipse overlay"># cd /usr/local/overlays/chewi-overlay

<title>java-config-ng</title>
<section>
<body>
	<p>
      Compnerd started java-config-ng as an attempt to improve the current 
	  java-config.  Yet again, it can found in the svn repository,
	  <uri link="https://svn.gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/java-config-ng/">here</uri>.
	</p>
    <p>
      axxo started a branch to add functionality to support things needed 
      for the 1.5 overlay and generally make things work. It can be found
      <uri link="http://gentooexperimental.org/svn/java/java-config-ng/branches/axxo/">here</uri>.
