<title>Why was Java 1.5 hard-masked for so long?</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
  Java 1.5 was hard masked forever because there were a number of issues which 
  made it unsafe to use a 1.5 JDK as your system VM.
</p>

<p>
  The first issue with Java 1.5 was backwards compatibility. If 
  you compile packages with a 1.5 JDK, the default behavior is that 
  the compiled classes can only be used in a 1.5 or above VM.
</p>

<p>
  The other significant issue is that there are packages which are not 
  compatible with JDK 1.5, as they currently exist in the portage tree. For 
  example, several abstract classes and interfaces now have new abstract 
  methods in 1.5. This means that packages would need to be patched to 
  override these abstract methods. Failing that, you could also try using 
  1.4 to compile the offending package.  However, due to the backwards 
  compatibility problem mentioned above, you wouldn't be able to use 
  external libraries, because they were compiled only for 1.5.

  <p>
    The good news is that work is that support for 1.5 is here!
  </p>

  <p>
      To begin using it, you will need to follow the <uri
      link="java-upgrade.xml">upgrade guide</uri>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Java documentation has been updated for the usage of this new system,
	and is available at:
