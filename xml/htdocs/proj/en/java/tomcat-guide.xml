    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <body>
        <p>
	  Some aspects of Tomcat on Gentoo are slightly different than how upstream handles it.

          . This document aims to
          provide some information on how it differs
          . This document is based on Tomcat versions 5.5.x and later. Older
          versions of Tomcat should not be used, as it is discouraged by upstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest initial difference on Gentoo is Tomcat being spread across 
          multiple directories. That is because applications on Gentoo strive to
          comply FHS, in addition to Gentoo-specific standards. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another major differences is that Tomcat is compiled from source,
          along with the latest versions of any dependencies and bundled libraries,
          which will also be compiled from source.  
        </p>
        <p>
	  There are a number of smaller details, which will be covered in detail soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document will not cover <uri link="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">
          Java Servlet Specifications</uri>, nor general
          <uri link="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat configuration</uri>.
          This document assumes the reader has a basic understanding of what a Java
          Web Application is, consists of, and basics of how to configure a container for the
          web application.

      <title>Standard Tomcat Layout</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The root directory of a typical Tomcat binary distribution is laid out as illustrated
          in the following listing.
        </p>
        <pre caption="Standard Tomcat Root Directory Layout">/opt/tomcat-*/bin

/opt/tomcat-x.y.z/webapps
/opt/tomcat-x.y.z/work</pre>
      	<p>
	  Of course, substitute the real version for x.y.z.

      <title>Gentoo Tomcat Layout</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          To comply with FHS and Gentoo standards, Tomcat has been dissected 
	  and installed into the following locations.
        </p>
        <pre caption="Gentoo Tomcat Layout">/etc/tomcat-x.y.z/conf
/var/run/tomcat-x.y.z/work

      <title>Configuration Files</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          In addition to simply moving the Tomcat <path>/conf</path> directory under
         <path>/etc</path>. There is a Gentoo-specific Tomcat configuration file
         <path>etc/conf.d/tomcat-x.y</path>, which contains Tomcat variables that are
         sourced by <path>/etc/init.d/tomcat-x.y</path>. These variables are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>
        	    JAVA_HOME: default is to be set to <c>$(java-config --jdk-home) by default</c>, however this
                variable allows Tomcat to run with a VM other than the system vm
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_HOME: default is <path>/usr/share/tomcat-x.y</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_BASE: default is <path>/var/lib/tomcat-x.y</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_USER: default is tomcat
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_LIBDIR: default is typically 
                <path>/usr/share/tomcat-x.y/server/lib</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CLASSPATH: default is <c>${CATALINA_LIBDIR}</c>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_TMPDIR: default is <path>/var/tmp/tomcat-*</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    TOMCAT_START: default is "start", with alternatives being "debug", 
                "start -security", "debug -security", or "jpda start"
              </li>
              <li>
        	    TOMCAT_STOP: default is "stop"
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_OPTS: not set by default , can be used to pass options to Java or Tomcat
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
	  The Gentoo init script is also installed into <path>/etc</path>, at
          <path>/etc/init.d/tomcat-x.y</path> . Tomcat on Gentoo no longer uses
          or modifies catalina.sh.

      <title>Web Applications</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The <path>/var/lib/tomcat-x.y/</path> contains a symlinks to other Tomcat directories, and the <path>webapps/</path>
          directory where actual web applications go. This directory serves as
          the hub and is referenced by Tomcat as the TOMCAT_BASE.
        </p>

    <title>Installation</title>
    <section>
      <title>Tomcat's USE flags</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Tomcat's USE flags are not any different from USE flags for any package on
          Gentoo. Most are self-explanatory like doc, sources, and test. They are for documentation, 
          sources, and running unit tests, correspondingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The puretls USE flag indicates to use the optional use of puretls. 
          When used, Tomcat will be compiled using
          <uri link="http://www.rtfm.com/puretls/">Claymore Systems's PureTLS</uri>
          instead of the default
          <uri link="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">Sun's JSSE</uri>. 
	  This effects which SSL library the resulting Tomcat binaries will 
	  be built against. The puretls USE flag is not widely used. At this
	  time there are no official Tomcat binary releases built against
	  PureTLS. If you decide to enable the puretls USE flag.
          Please do not go complaining to the Tomcat community, unless it's
	  related to filing a bug, development, or improvement with regard to
	  PureTLS. Please do not expect much support from the Gentoo Java
	  community on PureTLS with Tomcat either, because the Gentoo Java team is limited to what upstream supports as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The examples USE flag should be used for anyone new to Tomcat,
          Java Web Application development, or just about anything beyond 
	  deploying existing applications. When set, the examples USE flag
	  will install the example web applications, which includes the default
	  'Tomcat is running', and web based documentation. Without the
          examples USE flag set, any request to <uri>http://127.0.0.1:8080</uri>
	  will result with a blank page. This would be desired if Tomcat is a 
	  dependency for other wanted Java applications, where the examples
	  will not be used. Most all can safely ignore this USE flag, unless you are starting out.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Emerge Tomcat</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Once you have the desired USE flags set in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>
	  or <path>/etc/portage/package.use</path> it's
          time to actually install Tomcat. Tomcat, like every other package on Gentoo, is installed by doing:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Command to download, compile, and install Tomcat">
emerge tomcat</pre>
        <warn>
          Because Tomcat is compiled from source, along with all its
	  dependencies, a lot of packages may be pulled in at emerge time.
          Good news is, since it's Java, aside from download time, should
          compile rather quickly even on older machines.
        </warn>

  <chapter>
    <title>Usage</title>
    <section>
      <title>Configuring Tomcat</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Depending on what Tomcat will be used for, one may or may not need to
          finely configure Tomcat. If Tomcat is just a dependency of another
	  application, one might be able to simple start
          Tomcat, and request the application via a browser or etc at
          http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most others, particularly developers, running more than one site under Tomcat, or etc.  will need to edit Tomcat's main configuration file
          <path>/etc/tomcat-x.y.z/server.xml</path>. The syntax of that file,
	  and configuration of Tomcat is beyond the scope of this document.
	  Please refer to
          <uri link="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat documentation</uri>
          for more information.
        </p>
      </body>

    <section>
      <title>Using a Specific VM</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          By default, Tomcat will use the system VM controlled by
	  <c>java-config</c> as-per the JAVA_HOME variable in
	  <path>/etc/conf.d/tomcat-x.y.z</path>. One can
          change that variable to point to any VM that is capable of
	  running Tomcat. Then, when Tomcat is started, it will use the
	  specified VM.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Starting/Stopping Tomcat</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Tomcat is started and stopped the same as any service on Gentoo.
        </p>
        <pre caption="Start Stop Restart Tomcat">
/etc/init.d/tomcat-x.y [ start | stop | restart ]</pre>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Tomcat's Standard Web Applications</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          By default we do not install Tomcat's examples web application. We
	  do , however, install Tomcat's admin and manager applications.
	  However per upstream Tomcat policy, no usernames or passwords are
	  configured by default. <path>/etc/tomcat-*/tomcat-users.xml</path>
	  should be modified to add users
        </p>
        <pre caption="Admin and Manager Web Application URLs">

	  with the Gentoo Java community and Team, which can be reached via
	  the gentoo-java mailing list, or
          #gentoo-java IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. Please file and
