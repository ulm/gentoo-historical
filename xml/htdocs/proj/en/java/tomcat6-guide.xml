    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <body>
        <p>
	  Some aspects of Tomcat on Gentoo are slightly different than 
	  how upstream handles it. This document aims to provide some 
	  information on how it differs. This document is based on 
	  Tomcat versions 6.0.x and later. Versions of Tomcat 
	  older than 5.5.x should not be used, as it is discouraged by 
	  upstream. Otherwise please use 6.0.x or 
	  later when released.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest initial difference on Gentoo is Tomcat being spread across 
          multiple directories. That is because applications on Gentoo strive to
          comply FHS, in addition to Gentoo-specific standards. Another major differences
          is that Tomcat is compiled from source, along with the latest versions of any
          dependencies and bundled libraries, which will also be compiled from source.
          There are a number of smaller details, which will be covered in this guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document will not cover <uri link="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">
          Java Servlet Specifications</uri>, nor general
          <uri link="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat configuration</uri>.
          This document assumes the reader has a basic understanding of what a Java
          Web Application is, consists of, and basics of how to configure a container for the
          web application.

      <title>Gentoo Tomcat Layout</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          To comply with FHS and Gentoo standards, Tomcat has been dissected 
	  and installed into the following locations.
        </p>
        <pre caption="Gentoo Tomcat Layout">
/usr/share/tomcat-x.y/bin
/etc/tomcat-x.y

      <title>Configuration Files</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          In addition to simply moving the Tomcat <path>/conf</path> directory under
         <path>/etc</path>. There is a Gentoo-specific Tomcat configuration file
         <path>/etc/conf.d/tomcat-x.y</path>, which contains Tomcat variables that are
         sourced by <path>/etc/init.d/tomcat-x.y</path>. These variables are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>
        	    JAVA_HOME: default is to be set to <c>$(java-config --jdk-home)</c>.
                Changing this variable allows Tomcat to run with a VM other than the 
                system VM
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_HOME: default is <path>/usr/share/tomcat-x.y</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_BASE: default is <path>/var/lib/tomcat-x.y</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_USER: default is tomcat
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_LIBDIR: default is typically 
                <path>/usr/share/tomcat-x.y/lib</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CLASSPATH: default is <c>${CATALINA_LIBDIR}</c>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_TMPDIR: default is <path>/var/tmp/tomcat-x.y</path>
              </li>
              <li>
        	    TOMCAT_START: default is "start", with alternatives being "debug", 
                "start -security", "debug -security", or "jpda start"
              </li>
              <li>
        	    TOMCAT_STOP: default is "stop"
              </li>
              <li>
        	    CATALINA_OPTS: not set by default , can be used to pass options to Java or 
        	    Tomcat
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
	      The Gentoo init script is also installed into <path>/etc</path>, at
          <path>/etc/init.d/tomcat-x.y</path> . Tomcat on Gentoo no longer uses
          or modifies catalina.sh.

      <title>Web Applications</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The <path>/var/lib/tomcat-x.y/</path> contains <path>shared</path> for 
          shared libraries, <path>webapps</path> for web applications, and symlinks 
          to other Tomcat directories. This directory serves as the hub and is 
          referenced by Tomcat as the CATALINA_BASE.

    <title>Installation</title>
    <section>
      <title>Tomcat's USE flags</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Tomcat's USE flags are not any different from USE flags for any package on
          Gentoo. Most are self-explanatory like doc, source, and test. They are for 
          documentation, sources, and running unit tests, correspondingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The examples USE flag should be used for anyone new to Tomcat,
          Java Web Application development, or just about anything beyond 
	  deploying existing applications. When set, the examples USE flag
	  will install the example web applications. Most all can safely 
          ignore this USE flag, unless you are starting out.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Emerge Tomcat</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Once you have the desired USE flags set in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>
	      or <path>/etc/portage/package.use</path> and added packages names to
	      <path>/etc/portage/package.keywords</path> it's time to actually install 
	      Tomcat. Tomcat, like every other package on Gentoo, is installed by doing:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Command to download, compile, and install Tomcat">
emerge tomcat</pre>
        <warn>
          Because Tomcat is compiled from source, along with all its
	  dependencies, a lot of packages may be pulled in at emerge time.
          Good news is, since it's Java, aside from download time, should
          compile rather quickly even on older machines.
        </warn>
      </body>

  <chapter>
    <title>Usage</title>
    <section>
      <title>Configuring Tomcat</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Depending on what Tomcat will be used for, one may or may not need to
          finely configure Tomcat. If Tomcat is just a dependency of another
	  application, one might be able to simple start
          Tomcat, and request the application via a browser or etc at
          http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most others, particularly developers, running more than one site under Tomcat, or etc.  will need to edit Tomcat's main configuration file
          <path>/etc/tomcat-x.y/server.xml</path>. The syntax of that file,
	  and configuration of Tomcat is beyond the scope of this document.
	  Please refer to
          <uri link="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat documentation</uri>
          for more information.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Using a Specific VM</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          By default, Tomcat will use the system VM controlled by
	  <c>java-config</c> as-per the JAVA_HOME variable in
	  <path>/etc/conf.d/tomcat-x.y</path>. One can
          change that variable to point to any VM that is capable of
	  running Tomcat. Then, when Tomcat is started, it will use the
	  specified VM.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Logging</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          As of 5.5.x Logging has changed a bit. Tomcat no longer uses log4j by default.
          Applications can still use log4j, however the jars have to be put onto the classpath manually.
          For more information please refer to Tomcat's documentation on logging.
          <uri>http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/tech.html</uri>
        </p>
        <warn>
         log4j.jar MUST be in the same directory as commons-logging.jar. The lowest 
         classloader level they should be put in is /usr/share/tomcat-x.y/lib. The recommended is
         /var/lib/tomcat-x.y/shared, or in a specific webapp's WEB-INF/lib directory.
        </warn>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Starting/Stopping Tomcat</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Tomcat is started and stopped the same as any service on Gentoo.
        </p>
        <pre caption="Start Stop Restart Tomcat">
/etc/init.d/tomcat-x.y [ start | stop | restart ]</pre>

    <section>
      <title>Tomcat's Standard Web Applications</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          By default we do not install Tomcat's admin, docs, or examples web
	  application.
	  We do, however, install Tomcat's ROOT and manager applications.
	  However per upstream Tomcat policy, no usernames or passwords are
	  configured by default. <path>/etc/tomcat-x.y/tomcat-users.xml</path>
	  should be modified to add users
        </p>
        <pre caption="ROOT and Manager Web Application URLs">
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/html/
        </pre>
        <note>
          As of 6.0.x the admin webapp is no longer shipped or developed.
          It's not in the sources, nor available as a binary for download.
        </note>

    <section>
      <title>Missing Jar - tomcat-dbcp.jar</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Currently the tomcat-dbcp.jar is not build by default. To build that jar
          Tomcat robs .java source files from 3 other commons packages, collections, 
          pool, and dbcp. There is no clean solution to compiling this jar at this time.
          Suggestions, patches, or any assistance on compiling that jar is greatly 
          appreciated.
        </p>
	<p>
	  There are alternatives to this jar. You can use commons-dbcp.jar, or
	  use the factory provided by most all jdbc drivers.
	</p>
        <note>
          For the time being anyone who needs that jar should fetch it from a binary release
          of Tomcat 6.0.x. Just place the jar into /lib and you will be all set.
        </note>
        <p>
          For more information on the missing jar, please refer to

          These are some features which are either in consideration, under development,

        	    Modify Tomcat init script or ebuild to use JSVC so Tomcat can run on 
        	    unprivileged ports. This might not happen, as in there are other ways to do
        	    this. We are working with upstream on this but are far from an ideal solution.
