<section>
<title>Documentation Licensing</title>
<body>

<p>
The idea is to have all documents available under some kind of open
documentation license. Several discussions have emerged since the first
proposal, up until the managers meeting from september the 8th where the
final decision has been made: all documentation that gentoo provides
must be licensed under the <uri 
link="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0">Creative Commons - 
Attribution / Share Alike</uri> (CC-BY-SA) license.
</p>

<pre caption = "Roadmap for Documentation Licensing">
1. Discussion on license
<i>2. Implementation of license</i>
3. Removal of non-licensed documentation

<section>
<title>Team Organization</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo Documentation team needs to be structered in a way that
everybody (and especially the other Gentoo developers) know who is part
of the documentation team and with what duties.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, a list of all team members must be made public,
together with their e-mail address and their duty. A duty can be:
</p>

<ul>
<li><e>Lead Translator</e>: This person is in charge of a language for
translated documentation.</li>
<li><e>Follow-Up Lead Translator</e>: If the Lead Translator is on a
hiatus, this person takes over the job.</li>
<li><e>Subproject Lead</e>: This person is in charge of a GDP
Subproject.</li>
<li><e>Editor / Reviewer</e>: This person edits documents to fix a
bugreport or adds enhancements. He/she is also in charge of checking
existing bugfixes for their sanity (reviewing of patches).</li>
<li><e>Strategic Manager</e>: This person is in charge of the long-term
vision (and implementation) of the GDP.</li>
<li><e>Operational Manager</e>: This person is in charge of the
daily managerial tasks of the GDP.</li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Fully Translated Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
As you probably figured out by now, this project aims to translate all
Gentoo documentation into several languages. Every language has its own
responsible lead translator in charge of the translation efforts for his
language.
