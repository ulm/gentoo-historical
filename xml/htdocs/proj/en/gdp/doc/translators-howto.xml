<title>What does this document explain?</title>
<body>

<p>
Frequently, people are interested in joining the Gentoo translation teams and
contributing to the translation efforts. However, few of them know what a
translator does, needs to know and how translations are handled. This howto
should answer most questions, and if you still have some questions left, contact
<mail link="neysx@gentoo.org">Xavier Neys</mail> or <mail 
link="swift@gentoo.org">Sven Vermeulen</mail>.

<chapter>
<title>Situation</title>
<section>
<title>Structure</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="/proj/en/gdp">Gentoo Documentation Project</uri> has a seperate
<uri link="/proj/en/gdp/international.xml">Internationalisation Project</uri>
which involves all translation efforts. This subproject is lead by <mail
link="neysx@gentoo.org">Xavier Neys</mail> and embraces all translation
teams.
</p>

<p>
Every translation team is lead by a <e>Lead Translator</e>. This person is
responsible for all the translations created by the translation team. You can
find the <e>Lead Translator</e> for your language on the <uri
link="/proj/en/gdp/international.xml"> Internationalisation Project Page</uri>.
</p>

<p>
In case the <e>Lead Translator</e> is off (vacation, exams, network connectivity
issues, ...) the <e>Translator Follow-Up</e> takes over his job. Both the
<e>Lead Translator</e> and <e>Follow-Up Lead Translator</e> are Gentoo
Developers and should act like one.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="trans_situation">
<title>Lead Translator and Translator Follow-Up</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Lead Translator</e> acts as the translation lead, his successor is the
<e>Translator Follow-Up</e>. Both developers must be acquainted
with the following important documents:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <uri link="/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml?part=3&amp;chap=1">Gentoo 
    Ebuild Policy</uri>:
    Although this document is most important for Ebuild-writers, the <e>Lead
    Translator</e> and <e>Translator Follow-Up</e> must understand this 
    document. As Gentoo Developers they are supposed to be able to answer the 
    common questions about Gentoo that are discussed in this document (such as 
    QA and masked packages).
  </li>
<!--
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-release-policy.xml">Gentoo Release Policy</uri>:
    Every Gentoo Developer must know how Gentoo Releases are made. As Gentoo
    Developers, the <e>Lead Translator</e> and <e>Translator Follow-Up</e> may 
    not give wrong information regarding Gentoo releases to other people. 
  </li>
-->
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/doc-policy.xml">Gentoo Documentation Policy</uri>: Every
    Gentoo Documentation Developer, including the <e>Lead Translator</e> and
    <e>Translator Follow-Up</e> must read and learn this policy by heart. It
    lists all guidelines regarding documentation development. Not adhering to
    this policy may lead to sanctions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">Gentoo Linux XML Guide</uri>: All Gentoo
    Documentation is written in GuideXML, an easy-to-learn and easy-to-write
    format that allows us to easily convert the documentation to any format
    using XSLT. This document explains how GuideXML is structured <e>and</e>
    discloses the Coding Style used in the Gentoo Documentation Project.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The <e>Lead Translator</e> has CVS commit access to the documentation tree in
Gentoo's CVS repository. The <e>Lead Translator</e> - and only the <e>Lead
Translator</e> - is allowed to add and update translations on the website. He is
responsible for the translations on the website and for their accuracy. Failing
to correctly review the translations (resulting in wrong instructions in our
translated guides that don't exist in the English versions) is a serious error.
</p>

<p>
The <e>Translator Follow-Up</e> has CVS commit access to the documentation tree
in Gentoo's CVS repository, but may not use it unless the <e>Lead Translator</e>
cannot perform his duties in a reasonable time. In that case, his duties are
equal to the <e>Lead Translator</e> as are his responsibilities.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Translation Teams</title>
<body>

<p>
Every translation team is free to organise their translation efforts as they see
fit. If a team requires a common mailinglist, they can contact <mail
link="swift@gentoo.org">Sven Vermeulen</mail> to setup a translation-specific
mailinglist for their language (gentoo-doc-${LANG}@gentoo.org). 
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <e>Lead Translator</e> and <e>Translator Follow-Up</e>, the members
of the translation team have no CVS access nor Gentoo Developer status. They do
not have to adhere to the restrictions of the Gentoo Developer as listed above.
It is up to the <e>Lead Translator</e> to provide the translation team members
with the necessary information. However, <uri
link="/proj/en/gdp/doc/doc-tipsntricks.xml">tips and tricks</uri> are available
that can be of help for the translation efforts.
</p>

<p>
Translators will probably want to subscribe to our <mail
link="gentoo-doc-cvs@gentoo.org">CVS mailing list</mail>. Whenever a Gentoo
developer commits a new English version of a document, a message is mailed to
this list. The mail contains the list of committed files and a diff of modified
files. Check our <uri link="/main/en/lists.xml">mailing lists page</uri> to
learn how to subscribe to our lists.

<title>Requirements</title>
<section id="trans_req">
<title>Translation Accuracy</title>
<body>

<p>
Translations available on the Gentoo website must be as accurate as possible.
The installation instructions (<uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml?part=1">Part I</uri> of the <uri
link="/doc/en/handbook/index.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>) are the most important
instructions and have absolute priority over all other documents. They may not
lag <e>more than three days</e> behind on the English document in case of
<b>important</b> updates (which will be announced on <mail
link="gentoo-doc@gentoo.org">gentoo-doc@gentoo.org</mail> by the <e>Operational
Manager</e> with "Important" in the subject. Less important updates are not
announced; in this case the documentation must be <e>accurate to two weeks</e>.
</p>

<p>
Operational documents (listed below) have the second highest priority. Their
translations may not lag <e>more than two weeks</e> behind on the English
document in case of <b>important</b> updates (which will be announced on <mail
link="gentoo-doc@gentoo.org">gentoo-doc@gentoo.org</mail> by the <e>Operational
Manager</e> with "Important" in the subject. Less important updates are not
announced; in this case the documentation must be <e>accurate to three
weeks</e>.
</p>

<p>
Operational documents are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/altinstall.xml">Alternative Installation Guide</uri>
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml?part=2">Part II</uri> of the
    <uri link="/doc/en/handbook/index.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-security.xml">Gentoo Security Guide</uri>
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="/doc/en/alsa-guide.xml">ALSA Configuration Guide</uri>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
All other documentation may not lag more than <e>two months</e> behind.
</p>

<p>
In case these requirements cannot be met, the translations must be
<e>unlinked</e> from the website until they are updated. In case a complete
language fails to have updated documentation (meaning that most documents are
unlinked from the main page) the <e>Operational Manager</e> is in charge of the
language.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Documentation that does not require translations</title>
<body>

<p>
The following documents are best left untranslated. They are targeted at Gentoo
Developers which must understand the English language:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <uri link="/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml">Gentoo Development Handbook</uri>
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="/proj/en/gdp/doc/doc-policy.xml">Gentoo Linux Documentation Policy</uri>
  </li>
  <li>
    All project-specific documentation located in
    <path>[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/proj/</path>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Contributing</title>
<section>
<title>Contacting the Lead Translator</title>
<body>

<p>
Contributors should contact the <e>Lead Translator</e> listed on the <uri
link="/proj/en/gdp/international.xml">Internationalisation Project Page</uri> 
to ask how they can help. The <e>Lead Translator</e> should then inform the 
potential translation member about how the translations for his language are 
managed.  
</p>

<p>
In case a contributor believes that the <e>Lead Translator</e> does not perform
well, he can always contact <mail link="neysx@gentoo.org">Xavier
Neys</mail> or <mail link="swift@gentoo.org">Sven Vermeulen</mail> to
express his concerns.
