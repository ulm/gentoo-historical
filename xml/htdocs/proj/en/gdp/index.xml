<p><b>What we do, and who we are</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project (GDP) is the official project of the
Gentoo project responsible for the creation and maintenance of all
official Gentoo documentation. The GDP is not a closed team of any
sorts, but instead an open community commited to critiqing, and possibly
integrating, viable user documentation.
</p>

<p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project was formed to address the need of
complete documentation for Gentoo. In doing so, the GDP team is commited
to the creation and maintenance of clear, concise, and original
documentation. We will protect our users and developers by the use of
free and open licensing on all documentation. The GDP is commited to
remaining a free and open project, and will abide by the Social Contract
set forth by the Gentoo Project.

<title>Participating</title>
<body>

<p>
To participate in the Gentoo Documentation Project first join the
mailing list at gentoo-doc@gentoo.org. Then ask if there are plans to
support something that you are interested in, propose a new subproject
that you are interested in, or choose one of the planned subprojects to
work on. You may talk to the developers and users in the IRC channel
#gentoo-doc on irc.freenode.net for more information or just to chat
about the project or any subprojects. If you don't have the ability to
actively help by contributing work we will always need editors to
maintain the quality and accuracy of the overall product. All
development, editing, and productive comments and feedback will be
greatly appreciated.
