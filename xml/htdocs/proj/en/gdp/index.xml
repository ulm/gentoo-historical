<description>
The Gentoo Documentation Project is the official Gentoo project devoted
to the complete and concise documentation of the Gentoo Project.

<longdescription>

<p><b>What we do, and who we are</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project (GDP) is the official project of the
Gentoo project responsible for the creation and maintenance of all
official Gentoo documentation. The GDP is not a closed team of any
sorts, but instead an open community committed to critiquing, and possibly
integrating, viable user documentation.
</p>

<p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project was formed to address the need of
complete documentation for Gentoo. In doing so, the GDP team is committed
to the creation and maintenance of clear, concise, and original
documentation. We will protect our users and developers by the use of
free and open licensing on all documentation. The GDP is committed to
remaining a free and open project, and will abide by the Social Contract
set forth by the Gentoo Project.
</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The first and foremost task of the GDP is to fix bugs in documentation and make
sure that the online documentation is available and at all times current
(including translations). However, there are other tasks in which the GDP is 
involved. Most tasks are of temporary nature - you will find information on the 
progress made on these tasks in the status updates. Unfinished tasks will be 
mentioned next.

<title>Gentoo Release 2004</title>
<body>

<p>
As Gentoo's next release will be made in January 2004 all installation-specific
documentation must be in tip-top shape. It is therefore vital that most efforts
go into improving the installation instructions in such a way that, when the
Gentoo release is made, no errors exist.
</p>

<p>
The following roadmap has been given to help this QA process:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Date</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>January 7, 2004</ti>
  <ti>
    From this day forward, only critical bugfixes to the Gentoo Handbook are
    allowed. This should make it possible for the translation teams to have
    their translations of the Gentoo Handbook in sync with the English document.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>January 11, 2004</ti>
  <ti>
    All documentation related to Portage and Gentoo-specific items must be in
    perfect shape.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>January 16, 2004</ti>
  <ti>
    Off-line versions of the Gentoo Handbook should be finished/reviewed and
    sent to the release engineering project for inclusion on the LiveCDs.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<title>Printable Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
The main objective of the GDP is to have the online documentation be in perfect
shape. Lots of users want to have offsite documentation too and even today most
of them are left in the cold. The GDP should work on printable documentation
(preferrably PDF), but albeit creating PDFs of its documentation isn't
difficult, the main issues are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The online available PDFs should be fully in sync with the online HTML
    documentation. This requirement translates into the fact that the
    webserver(s) should be able to generate the PDFs on-the-fly from the sources
    provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    The online available PDFs should be professionally-looking. This doesn't
    rhyme well with on-the-fly creation and more importantly, we currently don't
    have the resources to create professionally-looking PDFs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are interested in helping out in this issue, don't hesitate to contact
us. At this time, we believe that FOP is the best way to go as it allows us to
process the GuideXML into XML-FO, which can then be parsed to PDF. Other options
are of course also welcomed.
</p>

<p>
A second frequently-requested feature regarding the printable documentation is
to have a one-page, show all Handbook which allows for easy printing of the
Handbook. If we cannot provide a PDF as previously mentioned this option will be
introduced. However, at this point most efforts are going to the PDF creation.

<title>Moving User-Specific Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
Many projects host documentation that can be of use for the Gentoo users. To
centralise the documentation development efforts, those documentation should be
placed under control of the GDP project. A listing of these documents is
available under the resources.

<section>
<title>What are Status Updates?</title>
<body>

<p>
A status update is a small text covering what the GDP has done since the
previous status update. It is written by the operational manager and contains a
quick overview on how the GDP progresses. If you want to know what lives in the
GDP, and what is in the process of developing, this is what you should read.
</p>

<p>
Status updates don't usually talk about fixed bugs and updated documentation,
although that is the main task of the GDP.

<title>Participating</title>
<body>

<p>
To participate in the Gentoo Documentation Project first join the
mailing list at gentoo-doc@gentoo.org. Then ask if there are plans to
support something that you are interested in, propose a new subproject
that you are interested in, or choose one of the planned subprojects to
work on. You may talk to the developers and users in the IRC channel
#gentoo-doc on irc.freenode.net for more information or just to chat
about the project or any subprojects. If you don't have the ability to
actively help by contributing work we will always need editors to
maintain the quality and accuracy of the overall product. All
development, editing, and productive comments and feedback will be
greatly appreciated.
