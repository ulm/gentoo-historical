<date>October 20, 2003</date>

<description>
The Gentoo Documentation Project is the official Gentoo project devoted
to the complete and concise documentation of the Gentoo Project.
</description>

<longdescription>

<p><b>What we do, and who we are</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project (GDP) is the official project of the
Gentoo project responsible for the creation and maintenance of all
official Gentoo documentation. The GDP is not a closed team of any
sorts, but instead an open community committed to critiquing, and possibly
integrating, viable user documentation.
</p>

<p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project was formed to address the need of
complete documentation for Gentoo. In doing so, the GDP team is committed
to the creation and maintenance of clear, concise, and original
documentation. We will protect our users and developers by the use of
free and open licensing on all documentation. The GDP is committed to
remaining a free and open project, and will abide by the Social Contract
set forth by the Gentoo Project.
</p>

<task id="codingstyle">
<name>Coding Style</name>
<description>Applying a Coding Style to be used for all Documentation</description>
<longdescription>
As documentation is a joint effort of several editors and authors, it is
necessary to use a common coding style so that updates, changes and new
documentation don't differ too much internally. This way, editors can
easily make patches to documentation without being harassed too much
with a different coding, having to change their editor-tool or even have
to manually type in stuff they want to automate themselves. It is also
important to have a uniform external coding style so that users are not
confused about how documentation is written (consistent writing).

Keeping track of non-GDP documentation
</description>
<longdescription>
Several projects have their own documentation which they place inside their CVS
directory because it is easier for them. However, this documentation is 
frequently interesting for users and/or developers. This task aims to have an
official policy on this documentation, how it is handled, where it is linked
etc.

<startdate>2003-10-20</startdate>

    Get the opinion on all related managers regarding the documentation and how
    it should be handled.

<milestone finished="no">

  <description>
    Have all managers agree on a certain "policy" for this documentation. This
    policy can be a one-liner :)

<task id="pdffiles">
<name>GuideXML2PDF</name>
<description>
  Provide PDF files of all (or most) of the Gentoo documentation
</description>
<longdescription>
  The call for PDF'ed versions of our documentation is increasing. However,
  providing PDFs generated offsite is very difficult and may lead to old
  versions. In the spirit of "what is online is up to date" we are searching for
  ways to convert the GuideXML to PDF on-the-fly. Possibilities are XSL:FO, but
  others (using scripts etc.) are possible too.

<title>Participating</title>
<body>

<p>
To participate in the Gentoo Documentation Project first join the
mailing list at gentoo-doc@gentoo.org. Then ask if there are plans to
support something that you are interested in, propose a new subproject
that you are interested in, or choose one of the planned subprojects to
work on. You may talk to the developers and users in the IRC channel
#gentoo-doc on irc.freenode.net for more information or just to chat
about the project or any subprojects. If you don't have the ability to
actively help by contributing work we will always need editors to
maintain the quality and accuracy of the overall product. All
development, editing, and productive comments and feedback will be
greatly appreciated.
