As community using Gentoo as a desktop operating system continues to grow, the
main thing for much users is to make their favorite distribution appearance eye
candy. We created our project for exactly such users!
Gentoo Artwork Project (GAP) is a desktop subproject and is responsible for 
creation and maintenance of all artwork stuff.
