<p>
As the community using Gentoo as a desktop operating system continues to grow,
one of the main areas which the users tend to concentrate on are the themes and
artwork of their desktop. We created this project precisely for these users!
The Gentoo Artwork Project (GAP) is a desktop subproject and is responsible for
creation and maintenance of all the artwork-related stuff within Gentoo.
