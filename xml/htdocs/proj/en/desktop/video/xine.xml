<section> <!-- Introduction -->
<title>Introduction</title>

<body>

<note>
This guide was last updated for <c>xine-lib</c> version
1.1.8
</note>

<p>
<c>media-libs/xine-lib</c> is the package that carries the core of xine video
player. Differently from <c>mplayer</c> that is a standalone program, xine
frontends uses <path>libxine</path> to play video files. This has the
disadvantages that a crash inside <path>libxine</path> shows up as a crash of
the frontend itself, and that the included copies of libraries might end up in
symbols' collisions if they aren't taken care correctly. 
</p>

<p>
For this reason <c>xine-lib</c> package must be managed carefully, to avoid
adding dangerous crashes that might be difficult to reproduce (the same happened
in the past). As in many cases the crashes are difficult to grasp just looking
at the code, as there might be symbols collisions and similar stuff, to report
bugs it's important to produce also a valid
<uri link="/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml">backtrace</uri> of the crash.
</p>

<p>
Here you'll find a lot of "why and how" about <c>xine-lib</c> and related
packages like <c>xine-ui</c>, <c>gxine</c> and so on. Hopefully, this guide will
be updated during the time, also when maintainer changes.
</p>

<p>
To contact developers of the xine project, you can also use the #xine
channel hosted on FreeNode.

<section> <!-- Patches -->
<title>Patches</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c> used to be heavy patched on Portage tree; although the
original reason was because of
<uri link="/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml">automagic dependencies</uri>, there were
patches and fixes for those external projects (like <c>ffmpeg</c> or
<c>vidix</c>) that weren't being applied by upstream.
</p>

<p>
Since version 1.1.2 the patchset is heavily reduced, also because the former
maintainer (<mail link="flameeyes@gentoo.org">Diego Pettenò</mail>) is now
contributing directly to
<uri link="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xine">xine project</uri>. For this
reason, while he's present, it's a good idea to pass through him for patches
that are needed.
</p>

<note>
Since 1.1.4 version, the only patch needed is part of the old TEXTREL
patch; this patch is missing up to now.
</note>

<p>
If a patch that is not Gentoo-specific is being added to the ebuild, is usually
suggested to send it upstream through <uri
link="http://bugs.xine-project.org/">their tracker</uri>, to be applied
upstream. Similarly bugs that are not Gentoo specific are to be reported there
so that they can be fixed directly by upstream. Backporting patches is an option
once upstream fixed the issue.
</p>

<note>
The preferred method to receive patches by the xine project is to send them as
Mercurial exports: commit them on a local clone of the repository, and then use
hg export to prepare the patch to send. This way the original author of the
patch will be listed in the log.
</note>

<p>
As <c>xine-lib</c> uses a number of libraries that are synced from time to time
with its source tree, the patches that changes files imported from other
projects are usually not accepted by <c>xine-lib</c>'s upstream and needs to be
sent to the originating project. The main examples are <c>ffmpeg</c> and
<c>vidix</c>, but also <c>dvdnav</c>.
In those cases, if the patch is applied upstream, it might be usefult to ask
for a sync of the sources to xine's developers.
</p>

<p>
The patches are hosted in CVS inside <path>gentoo/src/patchsets/xine-lib</path>
and are organized by version. Released patchsets are tagged with the name of the
tarball minus the <path>.tar.bz2</path>. The directories contains also a series
file, as they are used by quilt: just symlink the checked out directory inside
an extracted source tree of xine-lib (for that version) and use <c>quilt</c> to
manage the patches.
</p>

<impo>
Also if usually this point was never stressed out, now that patches are hosted
on the CVS it's important that they bring a description in the header, with also
a link to relevant bugs, both in Gentoo and upstream.
</impo>

<section> <!-- External and internal libraries -->
<title>External and internal libraries</title>

<body>
<p>
As many other multimedia programs, also <c>xine-lib</c> has dependencies on a
lot of libraries for format input and output. Most of them are optional, and
some of them are included inside the same source tarball as the library.
</p>

<p>
The patches used in the past to use external libraries instead of internals are
now (as of 1.1.1 version of <c>xine-lib</c>) included in the original sources.
The use of external libraries is enabled passing
<c>--with-external-<e>library</e></c> to the <c>configure</c> script. It's
preferred to use the external libraries (Portage-provided) so that if they need
to be fixed, xine will make use of the fixes. This was for example the case of
<path>libmad</path> decoding library on 64-bit systems.
</p>

<note>
As also <path>libmad</path> is used external or not used at all, <c>xine-lib</c>
might not be always able to decode mp3 audio without it. Since version
1.1.2_pre20060328-r1 this doesn't lead to crashes any longer. Since version
1.1.3_pre20060929, even with mad useflag disabled MP3 files can be decoded
through FFmpeg (albeit with some problems).
</note>

<p>
An exception to the above rules applies to <c>libdvdnav</c>. The internal
version in xine-lib is a CVS snapshot of the copy developed by the Linux DVD
project, and thus works better than the last released copy. xine-lib 1.1 is not
yet ready to use the new version developed by MPlayer project.
</p>

<p>
Although in the past <c>ffmpeg</c> support was selectable between internal and
external through the <b>ffmpeg</b> useflag, starting from <c>xine-lib</c> 1.1.2
the only choice is to use the external copy. This makes simpler the ebuild,
requires messing less with the code to build PIC safe code, and reduces the
amount of TEXTRELs that are created. Updating <c>xine-lib</c> for newer
snapshots of <c>ffmpeg</c> might be required, but that should be done before its
actual unmasking.
</p>

<p>
Older ebuilds had to do some tricks to get the path for X libraries such as
libXv and libXvMC, as the default configure script didn't take the right
libraries when looking for them in the usual places. This is now solved as the
ebuilds depend on modular XOrg, and upstream configure now uses pkg-config for
libraries discovery.
</p>

<p>
There also was a problem using three different XvMC libraries. Since version
1.1.3_pre20060929, the <b>xvmc</b> USE flag uses the XvMCW wrapper library
rather than choosing at build time one of the three libraries.
</p>

</body>

<section> <!-- CFLAGS -->
<title>CFLAGS</title>

<body>

<p>
As many other multimedia programs, also <c>xine-lib</c> has its own problems
with extremely riced flags. Actually, the original xine-lib configure uses by
itself quite extreme flags, on x86 and amd64 platforms. A saner behaviour can be
applied by using the <c>--disable-optimizations</c> option at <c>./configure</c>.
</p>

<p>
In the past we had to force a few optimisations on to be able to build
<c>xine-lib</c> on x86, but as we now use the external copy of FFmpeg libraries,
most of the problems are solved and now xine-lib can be built fine without much
tinkering.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section> <!-- useflags -->
<title>useflags</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c> uses quite a few useflags. Almost every dependency has its own
useflag to enable or disable it. The useflags works basically as every other
useflag with the same name in other packages, but there are a couple that have
notes.
</p>

<p>
The first note is about <b>win32codecs</b> useflag. This is used to enable the
support for the binary win32 codecs that are emulated using a subset of Wine
functions. Since version 1.1.3 onward, as xine-lib supports decoding of WMV9
files through <c>ffmpeg</c>. The ASF demuxer is now forced enabled.
</p>

<p>
A note about the <b>debug</b> useflag is probably good; this useflag was added
after request in
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112980">bug #112980</uri>, and
just adds <c>-UNDEBUG -DDEBUG</c> to the flags passed to compiler.
<c>xine-lib</c> has a way to create a "debug build" by using special make
targets, this build simply adds <c>-DDEBUG -g</c> flags to the compiler flags.
Using that with <b>debug</b> useflag is bad looking inside the ebuild. The
<c>-g</c> flag should be passed by the user if he really wants debug data, so
the only thing ad hoc for the package is the <c>-DDEBUG</c> flag. If you want to
be able to get meaningful backtraces, please follow
<uri link="/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml">the related guide</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Talking about the <b>flac</b> flag, instead, it's useful to know that
it does not control the ability of <c>xine-lib</c> to decode FLAC
files: it simply enables or disables the libFLAC-based decoder and
demuxer, both of which are not mandatory, as there's a native FLAC
demuxer in xine-lib, and FFmpeg can decode FLAC files just fine
without this flag enabled.
</p>

</body>

<section> <!-- The TEXTRELs issue -->
<title>The TEXTRELs issue</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c>, along with other multimedia software, has problems related to
TEXTRELs in compiled binaries on x86 platform. The problem is stated in
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113255">bug #113255</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the PaX Team, <c>xine-lib-1.1.1-r3</c> and later versions are now
fixed not to have TEXTRELs due to the win32codecs support and to the
postprocessing filters of xine itself.
</p>

<p>
As <c>ffmpeg</c> is now always used external, all the issues inside this package
are now fixed, and the remaining ones are actually up to <c>ffmpeg</c> itself.
</p>

<note>
The patch was mostly merged into xine-lib CVS since before the 1.1.4
release, with the exception of some TomSoComp changes that seems to
cause crashes with some interlaced media when SSE is enabled; that is
the only missing patch up to now.
</note>

</body>
</section>

<section> <!-- CVS Snapshot -->
<title>Live Development Snapshots</title>

<body>

<p>
Missing an updated release after 1.1.1, and this having quite a few of problems
(counting in also a security issue), it happened that a pre-1.1.2 snapshot was
made and also marked stable. In case there will be need for more snapshots,
these are the basic instructions needed to generate one.
</p>

<p>
The first thig is to get a Mercurial checkout of xine-lib sources from the
proper branch. At the moment xine-lib is developed using Mercurial at <uri
link="http://hg.debian.org/">Alioth</uri>, and the branch you're interested to
is most likely the 1.1 branch <uri
link="http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib">http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib</uri>.
Make sure it is complete and not with a lot of FIXME in the log. After that you
can use the simple command <c>make dist</c> to build a tarball to use for the
ebuild. Make sure you try a <c>make distcheck</c> to ensure that everything is
present, and run a few compile tests as well as runtime tests so that it works.
</p>

<p>
Patches has to be applied over that snapshot, not included in the snapshot
itself, to make sure they don't collide if they have to be modified. The patches
can be handled as usual from Gentoo CVS with <c>quilt</c>.
</p>

<p>
The snapshot tarball, the directory inside it and the patches directory should
be all named using <c>${P}</c> variable, and the tarball should be compressed
with <c>bzip2</c>
</p>

<title>Frontends</title>

<section> <!-- xine-ui -->
<title>xine-ui</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-video/xine-ui</c> is considered the main xine frontend, as it's
released by the same project as <c>xine-lib</c> and it is toolkit-agnostic.
</p>

<p>
Its handling is much simpler than <c>xine-lib</c>'s, patches and bugs can still
be sent upstream through <uri link="http://bugs.xine-project.org/">xine's
tracker</uri>, and then dropped when the new releases are done.
</p>

<p>
In a fashion similar to xine-lib, also patches to <c>xine-ui</c> are hosted in CVS
at <path>gentoo/src/patchsets/xine-ui</path>, orderd by version. The directories
are also <c>quilt</c> patches so they can be symlinked and then managed by it.
It's important to document the non-obvious patches, as done for xine-lib.
</p>

<p>
Missing a 0.99.5 release, and having the previous one security issues, there's
currently in the tree also a snapshot version that fixes a lot of stability
issues, as well as a few security problems. The new 0.99.5 version should solve
all the previous issues.
</p>

<section> <!-- gxine -->
<title>gxine</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-video/gxine</c> is a frontend based on GTK2 toolkit, it has fewer
optional dependencies than <c>xine-ui</c> so it's usually simpler to manage.
Although it had a few security vulnerabilities in the past, the new code should
be safer. Patches to this can be sent to <uri
link="http://bugs.xine-project.org/">xine's tracker</uri> as usual or to the
upstream maintainer, <mail link="linux@youmustbejoking.demon.co.uk">Darren
Salt</mail>. As per xine-lib, the patches are welcome as Mercurial commits exports.
</p>

<p>
Like xine-lib, gxine is developed in a Mercurial repository at Alioth, you
probably want to get the branch <uri
link="http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/gxine">http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/gxine</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Of the few useflags, the only one that requires a bit of handling is
<b>nsplugin</b>, that is used to build and install the Mozilla plugin.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section> <!-- Kaffeine -->
<title>Kaffeine</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-video/kaffeine</c> is a KDE application that used to be a
<c>xine-lib</c> frontend, while at the moment it supports not only xine, but
also mplayer and gstreamer <e>KParts</e>. Xine remains the main engine and it's
the only mandatory one.
</p>

<p>
Its handling is usually in KDE herd's hands, as most of the problems that might
arise with it are related to <c>xine-lib</c> itself. The only important detail
to remember is that it requires a newer <c>xorg-x11</c> as there were troubles
with old versions and with <c>xfree</c>.
</p>

<p>
Kaffeine can use XCB library for xine video output, through the <b>xcb</b> USE
flag, which requires <b>xcb</b> USE flag to be enabled in
<c>media-libs/xine-lib</c> too. Upstream wants soon to make this a default
non-switchable behaviour as without XCB, Kaffeine's embedding through KPart
will make GwenView, Konqueror and other software crash at unload.
