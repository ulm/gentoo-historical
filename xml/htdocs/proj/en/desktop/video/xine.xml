<title>Introduction</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>media-libs/xine-lib</c> is the package that carries the core of xine video
player. Differently from <c>mplayer</c> that is a standalone program, xine
frontends uses <path>libxine</path> to play video files. This has the
disadvantages that a crash inside <path>libxine</path> shows up as a crash of
the frontend itself.
</p>

<p>
For this reason <c>xine-lib</c> package must be managed carefully, to avoid
adding dangerous crashes that might be difficult to reproduce (the same happened
in the past).
</p>

<p>
Here you'll find a lot of "why and how" about <c>xine-lib</c> and related
packages like <c>xine-ui</c>, <c>gxine</c> and so on. Hopefully, this guide will
be updated during the time, also when maintainer changes.

<section> <!-- Patches -->
<title>Patches</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c> is classically heavy patched on Portage tree. The reason of this
is that the original <c>xine-lib</c> package had a lot of <e>automagic</e>
dependencies, so it autorecognized presence of some libraries enabling or
disabling extra plugins for them. As this is not good in an ebuild, a dirty
workaround of faking <c>autoconf</c> cache was used. Unfortunately this is quite
difficult to manage, so instead of using that, it was moved to patching the
<path>configure.ac</path> file to add the switches needed. The patches are being
merged upstream, so they can be dropped when new versions are released that have
them applied.
</p>

<p>
If a patch that is not Gentoo-specific is being added to the ebuild, is usually
suggested to send it to <path>xine-devel</path> mailing list on
<uri link="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xine/">xine project space</uri> to
be applied upstream.

<section> <!-- External and internal libraries -->
<title>External and internal libraries</title>

<body>
<p>
As many other multimedia programs, also <c>xine-lib</c> has dependencies on a
lot of libraries for format input and output. Most of them are optional, and
some of them are included inside the same source tarball as the library.
</p>

<p>
Usually upstream suggest to use internal libraries, but for maintaining reasons
is usually preferred to use the Portage-provided libraries. This might require
patching of sources to use external libraries, or to pass
<c>--with-external-<e>library</e></c> to the <c>configure</c> script. When
patching the source, is preferred to add the parameter to configure, so that the
patch can actually be applied upstream.
</p>

<note>
As also <path>libmad</path> is used external or not used at all, <c>xine-lib</c>
might not be able to decode mp3 audio without it.
</note>

<impo>
There is currently a problem with the patch that uses external libraries, for
some reason flac decoding seems to be broken using external dts, a52dec or mad.
The reason of this breakage doesn't seem to be clear.
</impo>

<p>
An exception to the above rules applies to <c>libdvdnav</c>. For unknown reasons
using the external library a lot of DVDs seems not to work at all on xine (while
they works fine on vlc using the same external library), so the internal library
is used.
</p>

<p>
A different treatment is used for <c>ffmpeg</c>. The included version is highly
suggested by upstream, and sometimes it's just the only practicable way, as the
snapshot on portage might be too updated or too outdated to be used. For this
reason, the default behavior should be to use the internal copy, and then the
<path>ffmpeg</path> useflag is used to choose the external copy of it. The
external copy is usually faster and supports extra formats or variations of some
specific video or audio format.
