<section> <!-- Introduction -->
<title>Introduction</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>media-libs/xine-lib</c> is the package that carries the core of xine video
player. Differently from <c>mplayer</c> that is a standalone program, xine
frontends uses <path>libxine</path> to play video files. This has the
disadvantages that a crash inside <path>libxine</path> shows up as a crash of
the frontend itself.
</p>

<p>
For this reason <c>xine-lib</c> package must be managed carefully, to avoid
adding dangerous crashes that might be difficult to reproduce (the same happened
in the past).
</p>

<p>
Here you'll find a lot of "why and how" about <c>xine-lib</c> and related
packages like <c>xine-ui</c>, <c>gxine</c> and so on. Hopefully, this guide will
be updated during the time, also when maintainer changes.

<section> <!-- Patches -->
<title>Patches</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c> is classically heavy patched on Portage tree. The reason of this
is that the original <c>xine-lib</c> package had a lot of
<uri link="/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml">automagic dependencies</uri>,
so it autorecognized presence of some libraries enabling or
disabling extra plugins for them. As this is not good in an ebuild, a dirty
workaround of faking <c>autoconf</c> cache was used. Unfortunately this is quite
difficult to manage, so instead of using that, it was moved to patching the
<path>configure.ac</path> file to add the switches needed. The patches are being
merged upstream, so they can be dropped when new versions are released that have
them applied.
</p>

<p>
If a patch that is not Gentoo-specific is being added to the ebuild, is usually
suggested to send it to <path>xine-devel</path> mailing list on
<uri link="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xine/">xine project space</uri> to
be applied upstream.
</p>

<p>
As <c>xine-lib</c> uses a number of libraries that are synced from time to time
with its source tree, the patches that changes files imported from other
projects are not accepted by <c>xine-lib</c>'s upstream and needs to be sent to
the originating project. The main examples are <c>ffmpeg</c> and <c>vidix</c>.
In those cases, if the patch is applied upstream, it might be usefult to ask
for a sync of the sources to xine's developers.
</p>

<p>
The patches are hosted in CVS inside <path>gentoo/src/patchsets/xine-lib</path>
and are organized by version. Released patchsets are tagged with the name of the
tarball minus the <path>.tar.bz2</path>. The directories contains also a series
file, as they are used by quilt: just symlink the checked out directory inside
an extracted source tree of xine-lib (for that version) and use <c>quilt</c> to
manage the patches.
</p>

<impo>
Also if usually this point was never stressed out, now that patches are hosted
on the CVS it's important that they bring a description in the header, with also
a link to relevant bugs, both in Gentoo and upstream.
</impo>

<section> <!-- External and internal libraries -->
<title>External and internal libraries</title>

<body>
<p>
As many other multimedia programs, also <c>xine-lib</c> has dependencies on a
lot of libraries for format input and output. Most of them are optional, and
some of them are included inside the same source tarball as the library.
</p>

<p>
The patches used in the past to use external libraries intead of internals are
now (as of 1.1.1 version of <c>xine-lib</c>) included in the original sources.
The use of external libraries is enabled passing
<c>--with-external-<e>library</e></c> to the <c>configure</c> script. It's
preferred to use the external libraries (Portage-provided) so that if they need
to be fixed, xine will make use of the fixes. This was for example the case of
<path>libmad</path> decoding library on 64-bit systems.
</p>

<note>
As also <path>libmad</path> is used external or not used at all, <c>xine-lib</c>
might not be able to decode mp3 audio without it.
</note>

<p>
An exception to the above rules applies to <c>libdvdnav</c>. For unknown reasons
using the external library a lot of DVDs seems not to work at all on xine (while
they works fine on vlc using the same external library), so the internal library
is used.
</p>

<p>
A different treatment is used for <c>ffmpeg</c>. The included version is highly
suggested by upstream, and sometimes it's just the only practicable way, as the
snapshot on portage might be too updated or too outdated to be used. For this
reason, the default behavior should be to use the internal copy, and then the
<b>ffmpeg</b> useflag is used to choose the external copy of it. The
external copy is usually faster and supports extra formats or variations of some
specific video or audio format.
</p>

<warn>
As <c>xine-lib</c> does not detect which formats are supported by ffmpeg at
runtime, when it's released it usually requires a newer snapshot of that package
of the same date or later from when xine devels synced last time. In this case,
-r0 ebuilds might not have <b>ffmpeg</b> useflag and use the internal copy
until an external version is available to be used.
</warn>

<p>
The current ebuilds have to do some tricks to get the path for X libraries, such
as libXv and libXvMC; the reason of this is that the default configure script
does not seem to take the right libraries when looking for them in the usual
places, and we need to pass them the right path. As their path depends vastly
on the version of X11 installed in the system (that might be XFree or Xorg), the
<c>get_x11_dir</c> function can be used to find them.
</p>

<p>
In particular there's the problem that using three different XvMC libraries is
a complex way to handle <b>xvmc</b> flag. There should be support for XvMCW
library (that allows to configure at runtime which XvMC backend to use), but
that requires a newer version of <c>xorg-x11</c>, the experimental 6.8.99 branch
or the modular version. For this reason, it can't be enabled until a stable
modular <c>xorg-x11</c> is out of package masking.
</p>

</body>

<section> <!-- CFLAGS -->
<title>CFLAGS</title>

<body>

<p>
As many other multimedia programs, also <c>xine-lib</c> has its own problems
with extremely riced flags. Actually, the original xine-lib configure uses by
itself quite extreme flags, on x86 and amd64 platforms. As these were causing
some bugs difficult to smash, Portage's version patches it to avoid adding extra
flags.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, because of the need to build <path>libxine</path> with PIC
enabled and the scarse quantity of registers in x86 platform, a few extra flags
needs to be pushed in. For example it's not possible to build <c>xine-lib</c>
without <c>-fomit-frame-pointer</c> in x86, and this makes difficult to handle
debug. Also, you cannot build it without any kind of <c>-O</c> flag, so if user
doesn't provide one, you should at least use <c>-O2</c>.
</p>

<impo>
As most of the problems with CFLAGS are relative only to x86 architecture, it's
preferred to mangle them only in a protected section run only on x86 systems.
This way you avoid changing the flags for people that might use them on better
architectures, where, for example <c>-fomit-frame-pointer</c> can be avoided.
</impo>

<p>
As of release 1.1.1 <c>xine-lib</c> uses a configure option
<c>--disable-optimizations</c> to avoid adding more flags to the default flags
used by xine-lib itself. For this reason some flags needs to be added to the
ebuild as they are needed to build in certain conditions on x86 architecture.
Never enable optimizations insidea an ebuild as they add a lot of extra flags
that are known to have bad behavior on some GCCs and might introduce bugs that
are difficult or impossible to reproduce on a stable basis and then difficult to
debug. Remember that on x86 architecture <c>xine-lib</c> cannot be debugged.
</p>

</body>

<section> <!-- useflags -->
<title>useflags</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c> uses quite a few useflags. Almost every dependency has its own
useflag to enable or disable it. The useflags works basically as every other
useflag with the same name in other packages, but there are a couple that have
notes.
</p>

<p>
The first note is about <b>win32codecs</b> useflag. This is used to enable
the support for the binary win32 codecs that are emulated using a subset of
Wine functions. Before version 1.1.1-r1, without this flag xine lost also ASF
demuxing support, because the code was unstablea and lead to crashes when not
using win32codecs but, for example, ffmpeg to decode WMA files. Since version
1.1.1-r1, this problem seems gone, so the <b>asf</b> useflag got introduced to
control if enable or not the ASF demuxer (as it can be patented and not legal
on some countries). At the same time, before 1.1.1-r1 the <b>win32codecs</b>
useflag did not actually disable the building of the plugin, that was left
unused as it did not bring in the codecs and the ASF demuxer; from that version
onwards, <c>xine-lib</c> is patched to not build the plugin at all if it's not
passed.
</p>

<p>
Also, the <b>xvmc</b> useflag and its conditioned useflags (<b>nvidia</b>,
<b>cle266</b> and <b>i8x0</b>) have a special treatment. The single <b>xvmc</b>
can't enable XvMC output plugin as it requires to know which library to use, 
that is specific to a single driver (actually, if no library is specified, the
configure will look for libXvMCW, a wrapper library that allows to choose at run
time which low-level library to use; unfortunately that wrapper is present only
in XOrg 6.9 and later, pre-releases and final release). The three other
flags select the right library, but only one of them can be enabled to have the
output plugin. If more than one of them is enabled, the XvMC output plugin is
disabled. Because of the way the configure script was written, before patchset
24 (used by versions 1.1.1-r3 and 1.1.1-r4) if libXvMCW was present on the
system, XvMC and XxMC plugins would be built also if <b>xvmc</b> flag wasn't
present. With patchset 24 the <path>--disable-xvmc</path> configure parameter
was added to allow to disable it entirely.
</p>

<p>
A note about the <b>debug</b> useflag is probably good; this useflag was added
after request in
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112980">bug #112980</uri>, and
just adds <c>-DDEBUG</c> to the flags passed to compiler. <c>xine-lib</c> has
a way to create a "debug build" by using special make targets, this build simply
adds <c>-DDEBUG -g</c> flags to the compiler flags. Using that with <b>debug</b>
useflag is bad looking inside the ebuild. The <c>-g</c> flag should be passed
by the user if he really wants debug, so the only thing ad hoc for the package
is the <c>-DDEBUG</c> flag.
</p>

<section> <!-- The TEXTRELs issue -->
<title>The TEXTRELs issue</title>

<body>

<p>
<c>xine-lib</c>, along with other multimedia software, has problems related to
TEXTRELs in compiled binaries on x86 platform. The problem is stated in
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113255">bug #113255</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the PaX Team, <c>xine-lib-1.1.1-r3</c> are now fixed not to have
TEXTRELs due to the win32codecs support and to the postprocessing filters of
xine itself. There are still TEXTRELs due to <c>ffmpeg</c> code that needs to be
fixed in ffmpeg first.

<title>Frontends</title>

<section> <!-- xine-ui -->
<title>xine-ui</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-video/xine-ui</c> is considered the main xine frontend, as it's
released by the same project as <c>xine-lib</c> and it is toolkit-agnostic.
</p>

<p>
Its handling is much simpler than <c>xine-lib</c>'s, while it shares the problem
of needing <path>configure.ac</path> patches to disable optional dependencies
such as <c>ncurses</c> or <c>libcaca</c>. The patches can still be sent upstream
to <path>xine-devel</path> mailing list, and then dropped when the new releases
are done.
</p>

<p>
The only note about this is that it might require a bit of tweaking to the code
for portability, but it's usually a side problem, unlikely to happen again in
the near future.
</p>

<p>
In a way similar to xine-lib, also patches to <c>xine-ui</c> are hosted in CVS
at <path>gentoo/src/patchsets/xine-ui</path>, orderd by version. The directories
are also <c>quilt</c> patches so they can be symlinked and then managed by it.
It's important to document the non-obvious patches, as done for xine-lib.
</p>

</body>

</section>

<section> <!-- gxine -->
<title>gxine</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-video/gxine</c> is a frontend based on GTK2 toolkit, it has fewer
optional dependencies than <c>xine-ui</c> so it's usually simpler to manage.
Although it had a few security vulnerabilities in the past, the new code should
be safer. Patches to this can be sent to <path>xine-devel</path> mailing list as
usual or to the upstream maintainer,
<mail link="linux@youmustbejoking.demon.co.uk">Darren Salt</mail>.
</p>

<p>
Of the few useflags, the only one that requires a bit of handling is
<b>nsplugin</b>, that is used to build and install the Mozilla plugin.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section> <!-- Kaffeine -->
<title>Kaffeine</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-video/kaffeine</c> is a KDE application that used to be a
<c>xine-lib</c> frontend, while at the moment it supports not only xine, but
also mplayer and gstreamer <e>KParts</e>. Xine remains the main engine and it's
the only mandatory one.
</p>

<p>
Its handling is usually in KDE herd's hands, as most of the problems that might
arise with it are related to <c>xine-lib</c> itself. The only important detail
to remember is that it requires a newer <c>xorg-x11</c> as there were troubles
with old versions and with <c>xfree</c>.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section> <!-- amaroK -->
<title>amaroK</title>

<body>
<p>
<c>media-sound/amarok</c> is an advanced audio player for KDE, that uses xine as
one of its engines (the suggested one). It's managed by sound and KDE herds
together, and it's usually not a big trouble to handle.
</p>

<p>
THe most common problem with amaroK and xine backend is the interface skipping
all around an mp3 playlist. This is usually due to someone who builds
<c>xine-lib</c> with <b>-mad</b> useflag, and then tries to play mp3s with
amaroK using xine engine. Another cause would be unmerging <c>libmad</c>, this
way the mad plugin for xine cannot be loaded and so it doesn't play mp3s.
