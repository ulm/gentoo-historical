<title>Project Description</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Packages that are marked for stabilisation usually have to pass a series of tests.
Unfortunately these tests  are hard to apply to the mass stabilization process
like kde that includes ~300 packages. This subproject will help to find possible
issues in the testing versions of kde-/* packages.
</p>

<p>
Every month the KDE team have a meeting. In that meeting 
the members decide if there will be a new stable candidate.
If there is such, a member of the KDE team will create the full list of 
packages that are going to be stabilized, open the STABLEREQ on our bugzilla and
CC the kde-stable alias. Now all testers can start their tests.

To join this team there are no quizzes required. Members don't need

<title>What to do</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The testing procedure is simple. Every member should simply install, when asked, the unstable version of KDE that we have in the main tree.
If there are bugs found. It needs to be verified if it is a local fault, a packaging bug, or an upstream bug. So please consult a member
of the KDE team that will guide you. A contact via IRC is preferable.
