1. Roll call
alexxy, creffett, dilfridge, johu, kensington, reavertm

Welcome new developers kensington and creffett. Thanks to JoseJX for
participating as member of the powerpc team.

2. Add LINGUAS support to cmake-utils.eclass
Agreed to add a loop like that in qt4-r2.eclass to reduce ebuild code. It
expands the contents of LANGS to IUSE as linguas_*. A generic linguas handling
is not planed yet. 

3. Live KDE ebuilds have tests restricted
The usefulness of tests on live ebuilds was brought into question, since there
are enough problems with tests on normal releases. Agreed to enable tests when
I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING is set.

4. KDE 4.8 stabilization and PowerPC
The stabilization and keywording was pending up to the team meeting date,
because of gcc47 as requirement to restore the keywords on ppc/ppc64. This
blocker was mistaken added. PowerPC needs just Qt 4.8.1 to keyword KDE 4.8.
So there are no reasons the discuss to drop the ppc support from kde-base.
We never stabilized a KDE version on ppc64, because ppc64 has problems with
the size of the table of contents for ELF function calls that will be fixed
with gcc 4.7. johu ask for voting on dropping ppc64 at all. No real
majority/opinions about it. JoseJX prefers that ~ppc64 not be dropped from KDE
keywords. Agreed that JoseJX would keyword ~ppc, and if there were no problems
would also keyword ~ppc64, topic will be revisited.

5. Bugs
* Trying to change full name in KDE System Settings results in error or crash
https://bugs.gentoo.org/380899 
There is an existing workaround to disable the change full name functionality.
kensington will talk to upstream about the issue, and if there is no good
response in 2 weeks' time, we will apply the workaround.

* app-cdr/k3b: use media-libs/musicbrainz:3 instead of :1
https://bugs.gentoo.org/410347
Agreed that musicbrainz:1 is obsolete and that k3b does not appear to actually
use musicbrainz even when enabled. Dependency on musicbrainz will be dropped.

* dev-util/cmake: FindPythonLibs behaviour broken by Gentoo patches
https://bugs.gentoo.org/405181 
Dilfridge said that we should remove the patches and use command-line defines
to force specific python versions, agreed to test that.

* kde-misc/networkmanagement-0.9.0 and kde-misc/networkmanagement-0.8_p20110714 
wrong doc dir specified - https://bugs.gentoo.org/410139
Nobody has been able to reproduce the bug. Dilfridge suggested asking for more
information and will investigate further.

* kde-misc/interceptor - KDE4 Plasmoid - intercept (catch) the log info from
the syslog - https://bugs.gentoo.org/383733 
creffett suggested dropping this request because it requires too many big
configuration changes for a plasmoid. Agreed to remove kde from CC list and
suggest taking the ebuild to sunrise.

* dev-util/cmake-2.8.6-r4 - stop Xvfb after failed test phase
https://bugs.gentoo.org/406353
Need input from gentoo-portage team about what phase could be used to clean up
xvfb after test failures. Kensington mentioned that the same issue will affect
virtualdbus.

6. Open Floor
* KDE 4.9 Beta
Dilfridge reported that KDE 4.9 beta is coming out soon.

* Groupdav calendar bug in kdepim-runtime
Discussed whether to stabilize kdepim-runtime base version or -r2, which has a
possible fix for https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415401 but no
positive feedback. Agreed to go with -r2.

* creffett away
creffett will be out for a month on a trip with little internet access.
