Meeting topics:
0) roll-call
ABCD, alexxy, dilfridge, wired, scarabeus, deathwing00, patrick, jmbsvicetto
1) KDE 4.4 Stabilisation process. - creating stable team within kde team
We will add 4.4.4 to main tree, and start the required processes 7 days from that point.
No stable team since noone volunteer.
2) KDE 4.5 KDEPIM approach
  a. give developers one week to express what they feel about kdepim and to see if anyone volunteers to work on it
  b. if that fails or we can't find anyone willing to do it, make a public announcement about the issue, explain it and give a few options to users:
  b.1 have interested parties show up and work in the overlay to get it done - (what can be given as option to the community)
  b.2 have users vote for us to just ignore kdepim until it gets working
  b.3 give the above 3 options for someone to work on
3) Koffice 2.2 and designated maintainer choice
we shall try same approach as for kdepim to see if anyone is interested
4) Accepting major patches that alter stable branch (pulseaudio) [vote]
so lets keep status "if you keep it backported and polished you can have it..." together with the old "you break it, you fix it"
5) People in the team and their inactivity
Everyone in team is asked to reconsider their status. If they are not really active team members they should just remove themselves.
Everyone with no evident work on kde packages for last 2 months will be removed from the team.
Anyone who wants to join back or just join is welcome and just need to ask and be active.
6) open floor
