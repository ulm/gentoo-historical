Topics:

Formulate some kind of official policy for qt3 apps and their future
- Qt3 apps will follow the KDE3 example and will share one overlay for the stuff with it. Users will maintain it.
- Addition to main tree of new Qt3 apps is *highly* discouraged.
- Qt3 useflag is being marked as discouraged (removal from profiles and so on) since NOW :]
- A draft with ideas for it will be sent to the -dev ml by yngwin

Solving the python issues within KDE4 - currently with +kdeprefix KDE 4.2 and 4.3 can't live next to each other due to packages installed into site-packages for python.
- the issues running new pykde with old pykde using apps must be tested (pykde from 4.3 and python apps from 4.2)
- if above test prove not working, KDE misc apps will be forced to look into slotted dir in site-packages folder
- will be done by reavertm and patrick
- this issue is a stabilisation blocker

Solving the final question about kdeprefix.
- voting about kdeprefix mask in profiles (users can still unmask it, but kde is not as solid as with -kdeprefix)
For this vote our HT reavertm was allowed to vote since he is one of the few whom spent their time on it and are capable of handling kdeprefix.
reavertm = mask
scarabeus = mask
jmbsvicetto = can live with mask
patrick = abstain
alexxy = mask
- outcome was that it will be masked in profiles.
- alexxy will add the mask and adjust the guide.

Handle the PyQt3 qscintilla dependencies
- it seems that the Qt team has not decided if there is an issue or not. :P
- it will probably be mostly fixed by removal of Qt3 from profile. See topic no. 1.
- amarok will have python useflag removed and needed scripts will be removed
- introduce blocker between PyQt and PyQt4

KDE 4 Stabilisation.
- Jorge decided to target 4.2 for stabilisation.
- stabilisation bug will have to be opened
- tracking bug will have to be opened and bugs wrangled (volunteers??)

Review the useflags we enable by default in Qt herd
- rename gtkstyle to gtk in qt-gui
- drop IUSE defaults for useflags enabled by desktop profiles

Progress of KDE3 mess and way how anyone can help (here we call even for non-kdeteam devs)
- KDE3 misc apps are slowly moving forward
  mail to dev asking for help :]
- arts flag removal is also slowly moving
  (scarabeus will remove optional dep on arts by blocking it in eclass if scarabeus get some time, or anyone else can do it)
  mail the dev ml announcing its death, and asking maintainers for cooperation.
- mail the dev ml announcing we need some KDE3 dedicated dev
