21.5.2009 - KDE Meeting
Roll-call: wired, alexxy, scarabeus, dagger, hwoarang, tampakrap, bonsaikitten, krytzz, yngwin, civil, papillon81, reavertm, lxnay, cryos, jmbsvicetto

Cryos legitimely excused from not attending much, new baby on the route. Grats to him! :]

Doc handling
- doc == aplication handbook or handbook, to be decided...
- enable +doc/handbook by default for kde-base
- aplication api documentation - scarabeus write mail asking for some global useflag for it on -dev
- rename doc useflag to handbook with 4.3 again :D
- make it more handleable by eclass rather than in the ebuilds
- lxnay volunteer to do the packages update in overlay
- so priority coruse is:
  - mail to dev asking how to do it
  - wait a bit and if nothing constructive comes up do the rename for 4.3

kde3
- kill arts, all misc apps needs it removed and be stabled before 3.5.10 stabling
- stable 3.5.10, all kde related misc apps needs to be revbumped/verbumped and stabled before it
- tampakrap starts handling 3.5.10 stabilisation - stable bug asap 15.6. deadline
- writing doc about kde3/4 mixing - tampakrap

kdeprefix
- long discussion about support of kde4 +kdeprefix install in kde3 and gnome, will chat with reaver about it on aproperiate bug
- add ewarn for user when installing with +kdeprefix so we assure he knows what he is messing with. (controled same like live warning)

kde 4.3
- libknotification already handled, pdepend for kdelibs.
- policykit looks ok
- so no much work for 4.3 itself

kde/kde3 useflag
we voted about it, result:
kde - latest supported kde 4, 5, whatever
kde3 - for now kde 3 series, when kde5 is out there will be kde4 useflag and so on,...
as long as new version is expected to be highly experimental we will have kdeX where X is the version number. When proper support in portage arrives it mutate into kde and older kde mutate to kdeY where Y is X-1

phonon
- ship snapshot into the tree with kde 4.3
- separating xine part to be able use qt-phonon instead of normal phonon with kde - probably reaver

CODE:
improve it, and add requirements we find out that are needed
since next meeting the code will be considered final, and not folowing it will be punished

relwithdebuginfo:
deffered after some work on it, not worth efforts

GUIDE:
tampakrap promised to write the guide for kde3/4 mix that will cover also kde4 installing

kdebindings:
scarabeus + reaver: invent some logic there; delegate work to other HTs

sabayon:
discuss the topic more with joost_op at some other more convinient time
so far done ->
bugs from ppl with @sabayonlinux.org will be handled legitimely as our bugs
and we will reflect them as HTs for kde team so we dont have recheck reported things (aka we trust sabayon devs :})
