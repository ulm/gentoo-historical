Review of previous:
update for 4.2 went ok. Some minor issues :]
there is missing review for pyqt/pykde and printing stuff, that will be deffered until somebody step up for the fixing/testing.

This one:
droping of 4.1. - tampakrap

voting for leader -> jmbsvicetto, he get 7 voltes from devs (alexxy, tampakrap, hwoarang, scarabeus, yngwin, deathwing00) rest is not around so deal with it :]
all hail to the new leader jmbsvicetto :P

prefixing and using multiple versions of the kde in one prefix -> cooperation with upstream
installing libs and things versioned and use eselect to pick the one we want...
read the log around 21:30 and keep going for this one
jmbsvicetto, reavertm, maybe somebody more

3.5 - dropping the old .7 and .8
poke archies about stabling and checking keywords on .9
alexxy is going to do this one
