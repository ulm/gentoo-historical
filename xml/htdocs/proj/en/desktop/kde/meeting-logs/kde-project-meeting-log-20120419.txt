<dilfridge> ok that's 5min warning... so let's do quick roll call
<alexxy> i didnt tryed ppc
<alexxy> =)
<dilfridge> !herd kde
<willikins> (kde) abcd, alexxy, dilfridge, jmbsvicetto, johu, mschiff, patrick, reavertm, scarabeus, tampakrap, thev00d00
<alexxy> arm and mips yes
<dilfridge> roll call please :)
<tampakrap> here
<Thev00d00> here
<dilfridge> here
<scarabeus> ay for the captain
<dilfridge> :P
-*- kensington waves
-*- alexxy hides in superstrings continium =d
<dilfridge> oh dear
<dilfridge> p-branes
<Thev00d00> lol
<dilfridge> ok... since we dont actually have much agenda...
<dilfridge> 1) what do we do with kde-4.8.2? file stablerequest as soon as the 30days are done?
<tampakrap> too much load for the arch teams, I'd suggest to skip one version
<Thev00d00> Personally I think we may as well wait for .3
<dilfridge> ok
<Thev00d00> Is it still due May 1st?
<dilfridge> I'm fine with both
<dilfridge> yes
<dilfridge> so next stabilization would be 483 end of may
<dilfridge> and we can maybe add some patches to single packages if there are super-ugly bugs
<dilfridge> ok
<dilfridge> anyone against "next is 483"?
-*- johu is here
<scarabeus> i would like to ask you to open bugs for misc apps
<scarabeus> they are often working in testing and completely weird in stable
<scarabeus> so please jump over our herd packages and fill stablereqs where fit
<dilfridge> sounds reasonable
<johu> scarabeus: volunteer?
<dilfridge> how is euscan doing with the kde packages?
<johu> working good
<scarabeus> euscan is great
<scarabeus> but iksaf still didnt include my request to differ between versions in testing and in stable
<scarabeus> eg green only when latest is in stable
<scarabeus> otherwise orange
<dilfridge> get it
<dilfridge> good idea, no volunteer so far, we'll all have to do a bit each
<scarabeus> dilfridge: i do it every week on mo/tue
<scarabeus> but i cheat
<scarabeus> i dont open bugs
<dilfridge> :D
<scarabeus> i ahve stable boxes
<scarabeus> so i stable right away
<tampakrap> you can automate that
<dilfridge> ok
<dilfridge> there is one more question from me, and then I have all off my heart:
<dilfridge> 3) is anyone against a stablereq for calligra-2.4.0 ? (after the magic 30days)
<dilfridge> no bug reports so far
<johu> NO please do it
<johu> lets get rid of the koffice foo
<dilfridge> and it would be awesome to get rid of koffce
<tampakrap> is it dead?
<scarabeus> koffice ist kaput
<tampakrap> there were some discussions to move it to SC
<dilfridge> it is life, Jim, but not as we know it...
<johu> did you read in the last year any news update in koffice?
<dilfridge> more like zombie
<dilfridge> even the last blog posit of tzander was a year ago
<dilfridge> tampakrap: that suggestion led to a lot of opposition, it was seen as some scheme to give koffice a more official status than calligra
<dilfridge> but I stopped following the fuss at some point
<dilfridge> ok seems like nobody opposes
<dilfridge> anyone else has anything else?
<johu> yes kde481 is table
<johu> :)
<dilfridge> hehe
<johu> at least for amd64, x86
<scarabeus> yeah pretty nice chair it is
<johu> 4) arm stable in kde 49x?
<tampakrap> is qt stable in arm?
<johu> 472
<johu> 474 in porgress
<dilfridge> johu: I actually like the idea, but I dont have an arm machine that could run kde decently
<johu> 48x not decided yet
<johu> hm ok nvm
<dilfridge> I mean, the number of arm gadgets will go up more and more
<dilfridge> while ppc machines are falling apart
<scarabeus> we can do this for sabayon folks
<dilfridge> we could also think about packaging plasma-active
<tampakrap> how about asking in a blog post for volunteers?
<scarabeus> i dont see sane to run gentoo on arm machines right of the box now :)
<dilfridge> scarabeus: at least kde runs pretty well, people say (with hw graphics accel)
<dilfridge> tampakrap: what should the volunteers do exactly?
<tampakrap> arch testing
<tampakrap> obviously :)
<dilfridge> ok
<johu> dilfridge: do you got any answer from reavertm abouy the open issues/questions?
<dilfridge> yeah well it's an idea
<dilfridge> johu: no
<johu> hm :-/
<dilfridge> tampakrap: I'll ask the arm guys about this, if they like the idea I'll blog
<dilfridge> ah yes I remember one more thing
<scarabeus> what you guys want from Maciej?
<dilfridge> 5) the ewarns about the tar commands, they are completely useless even for devs. can they go away again?
<tampakrap> ask reavertm :)
<johu> :)
<scarabeus> they can go away
<johu> scarabeus: most questions are eclass related
<scarabeus> :D
<scarabeus> poor you :P
<scarabeus> but wait were there someone else with me working on that
<scarabeus> i know, JORGE!
<dilfridge> bug 358059
<willikins> dilfridge: https://bugs.gentoo.org/358059 "cmake-utils.eclass PREFIX is not defined"; Gentoo Linux, Eclasses and Profiles; CONF; meka:kde
<dilfridge> that is actually the only one left
<dilfridge> all the rest is imho done
<johu> linguas
<johu> or i missed something?
<dilfridge> kensington has found the problem I think
<dilfridge> we just need to doublecheck the solution
<scarabeus> dilfridge: ack on the patch
<johu> ok
<scarabeus> it actually fixes stuff i wrote there in first place :D
<tampakrap> it was creffett
<dilfridge> ok sorry
<dilfridge> scarabeus: I'll try to understand it myself over the weekend, and then...
<dilfridge> |:]
<scarabeus> basically now the prefix is defined on 5 places
<scarabeus> this defines it on one place
<scarabeus> and then just uses such var
<scarabeus> so it is correct
<scarabeus> only weird line is this one:
<scarabeus> -SET (CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR ${libdir} CACHE PATH "Output directory for libraries")
<scarabeus> +SET (CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR ${PREFIX}/${libdir} CACHE PATH "Output directory for libraries")
<scarabeus> "but when i think of it ; it looks correct
<dilfridge> we can always test in overlay
<scarabeus> nah rest of the patch is harmless
<scarabeus> just check one package if it puts shit into /usr/usr/lib64
<scarabeus> and if not it is correct
<dilfridge> hehe
<dilfridge> ok
<dilfridge> anything else to discuss?
<johu> 6) open floor
<tampakrap> SLED will have kde4.8 "soon"
<dilfridge> cough
<dilfridge> cough
<dilfridge> ok
<dilfridge> that means they consider kdepim-4.8 stable enough?
<tampakrap> isn't it? :)
<dilfridge> on my work desktop it's ok
<scarabeus> tampakrap: i dont think there is plan to build kdepim too :P
<tampakrap> it's built already
<tampakrap> the obs repo is linked from the opensuse 12.1 one
<johu> suse ich will sie nicht nimm duse
<dilfridge> lol
<dilfridge> it
<dilfridge> seems
<dilfridge> like
<dilfridge> we
<dilfridge> can
<dilfridge> close
<dilfridge> the
<dilfridge> meeting?
<johu> next time i have to organize the meeting it seems
<johu> :P
<dilfridge> hehe thanks in advance!
<tampakrap> no, give it to a new guy
<johu> who writes summary?
<dilfridge> whoever asks first :P
<johu> go away
<dilfridge> ok I'll do it
<dilfridge> cheers & thanks everyone
<johu> thx for chairing
<scarabeus> byes
