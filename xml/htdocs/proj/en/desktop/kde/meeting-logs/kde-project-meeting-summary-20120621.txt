1. Roll call (4 minutes, 5 minutes planned)
Present: alexxy, dilfridge, scarabeus, tampakrap

2. Move KDE 4.8.4 to the tree, and in which variant? (1 minute, 5 minutes planned)
   It seems that the problems have been solved with a) newer soprano or b) reverted commit.
   Which way do we want to go?
All in favour of reverting the commit in kdelibs and pushing 4.8.4 to the tree to work
with "old" soprano.

3. Once it's out, should we move KDE 4.9.0 to the tree? (3 minutes, 10 minutes planned)
   Currently 4.8.90 looks quite solid, so this is a real option.
All in favour of adding 4.9.0 to the main tree as ~arch

4. Udisks2 (8 minutes, 5 minutes planned)
   On request from Samuli I've added the Udisks2 patch from RedHat to kdelibs. This
   *replaces* the udisks:0 solid backend with a new udisks:2 version. Has according 
   to Wulf (Philantrop) still some issues.
   Feedback? Experiences? Keep for 4.9.0 or (temporarily) ditch again?
No decision, some discussion with alexxy and Philantrop about the problem. We'll keep
watching Fedora's code and talk to the Fedora maintainers.

5. Bugs (1 minute, 30 minutes planned)
   * app-cdr/k3b: Excessive use of REQUIRED_USE (and wrong combination USE="lame"+"encode")
    REQUIRED_USE was added, otherwise USE="-encode lame" does nothing
    Options:
        1. Revert to original behaviour - we don't care that USE="-encode lame" does nothing
        2. Keep the REQUIRED_USE, but rename lame -> mp3
        3. Drop the encode flag, but move the optional RDEPS to an elog
        4. Drop the encode flag and keep optional RDEPS (current behaviour)

Postponed since the principal actors involved were absent.

6. Open floor (10 minutes, 15 minutes planned)
tampakrap asks for more speakers and workshop organizers at the Gentoo miniconf October in
Prague. Some ideas are thrown around, nothing definite yet.
