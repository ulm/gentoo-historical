3. Dropping RPATH from installed binaries
Add a RPATH entry for every library dir that is not in the system library
directories in ld.conf are not automatically considered as system library
dirs, but only some static list of dirs. 
Everyone agreed on RPATH removal. We will introduce a patch with KDE SC 4.8.2
to remove the RPATH and move it to the main tree.

4. Bugs
* Remove hard dep on media-libs/phonon from kde-base/kdelibs
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356681
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388041
Upstream says "technically you can replace phonon with qt-phonon, but that's
just stupid because you lose functionality". Another argument against it, is
that qt-phonon will be removed with qt5. We wont fix the bug and keep phonon as
hard dep. johu will take care of the bug after meeting summary is available.

* Eclass problem with handbook without LINGUAS.
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=372457
The handbook eclass code is pretty confusing for all in meeting present
members. It was written by reavertm. We decided that we will mail reveartm to
fix handbook eclass code, because he has the most knowledge in it. dilfridge
will take care of contacting him, it's his first lead task.

* Revise the change "semantic-desktop? -> semantic-desktop=".
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=396491
Some packages rely on semantic-desktop capabilities in other ones. tampakrap
is volunteers to take care of the bug.

5. Open floor
* KDE 4.8 stabilization
KWin does not build anymore without opengl support. kde-base/kmail-4.8.1
crashes, but upstream patch can be backported. KDE SC 4.8.1 has tons of
bugfixes, compared to to 4.8.0. The majority votes for KDE 4.8.1 as stable
candidate. johu will prepare stabilization. 

* Test failures 
creffett brought up dbus-related test failures. johu recommended to get
virtual-dbus eclass running. dilfridge suggested if one or two test fails
or restrict. The problems with virtual-dbus is that you can't run bash
commands in it's environment. creffett will be responsible for this.

* New members
Welcome to three new members of the project: creffett, kensington and
dastergon. They are in the process to become gentoo developer and mentored by
tampakrap. creffett and kensington have already open 'new developer' bug.
dastergon doesn't have an open bug yet.

* Comeback
scarabeus re-joined KDE herd. Welcome back!!!

* Reduced work time
mschiff mentioned that he will not have much time for the KDE herd due to
real life priorities, he will be back in may. tampakrap will spent most of his
time for gentoo infra team.
