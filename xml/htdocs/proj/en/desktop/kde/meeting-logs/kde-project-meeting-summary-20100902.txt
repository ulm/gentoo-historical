1) KDE 4.5 status and plans to put it in Portage

We agreed that KDE 4.5.1 is suffering of some important bugs, and after
a long discussion we decided to put it in portage, but it will never
make it to stable branch. We are mentioning the upstream bugs, as we
think that users should be aware of them before updating:

- https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247144
- https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246931
- https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230247 <-The most important

Also, keep in mind that KDE SC 4.5 lacks the KDEPIM suite, so users
should use KDEPIM 4.4.5 instead, which is also stable in portage tree.
In case of an update it should be smooth.

2) KOffice 2.2 status

There are a few issues with it. The bump to 2.2.2 won't be so easy,
and most of the linking taking place in koffice-libs is not perfect.
dilfridge and tampakrap will take care of it, but it may not happen soon.

3) KDEPIM beta packages are released

This was skipped as alexxy, our snapshots master, was absent. It will
be discussed in gentoo-desktop mailing list

4) Open Floor

- dilfridge reported that digikam is almost ready, he cleaned up the
patches a lot and will tell reavertm when to move them upstream
- tampakrap reported that he is going to unmask knetworkmanager
- reavertm encouraged people working with live and tagged ebuilds to use
kde-misc/kde-overlay-servicemenus. It is a simple Compare/Merge service
menu, to avoid manual copy paste.
- tampakrap, as substitute leader, is going to remove some inactive team
members, as there were a lot of notices in the past.
