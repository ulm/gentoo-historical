2. KDE SC 4.8.2 stabilization after it is 30 days in tree?
KDE SC 4.8.1 is stable for amd64 and x86, ppc is still pending. We decided to
skip the stabilization for KDE SC 4.8.2 to reduce the work load for the arch
teams. Scarabeus suggested that we can stabilize other kde herd related
packages in the meantime. No objections, so we will walk over the packages,
search for candidates and file stable bug requests. 

3. Calligra 2.4.0 stabilization after it is 30 days in tree?
We are getting more and more bugs related to koffice. Calligra is the
successor of koffice. Qt 4.8.1 stabilization will be needed before, as a build
requirement for calligra. No arguments or objections against stabilization,
which will end up in replacement of koffice with the normal last rite
procedure.

4. Do we want to stabilize KDE SC 4.9.x on arm?
The number of arm gadgets will go up more and more, while ppc machines are
falling apart. KDE SC should work on arm. Sabayon would benefit by
stabilization too. We will need Qt 4.8.x stable on arm before. Unfortunately
none of the kde herd members have the hardware to test it. So we will need
volunteers/testers for that. Additionally we could think about packaging
plasma-active too. Dilfridge will ask arm herd about the idea, if they like
it, he will blog about it.

5. Remove tar command ewarns in eclasses? 
They are useless and anoying nowadays. Scarabeus acknowledged that they can be
removed.

6. Open bugs
* Bug #358059 - cmake-utils.eclass PREFIX is not defined
Scarabeus acknowledged that the patch is correct. We will test it in kde
overlay first.

* Bug #372457 - doc dir is not correctly disabled by kde4-functions.eclass if
NOT kde-base and LINGUAS is unset
Chris Reffet found a solution. We will test it in kde overlay first.

7. Open floor
* Tampakrap mentioned that SLES will have KDE 4.8 soon.
