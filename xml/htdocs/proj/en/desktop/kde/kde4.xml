<title>Removing any pre-release ebuilds</title>
<body>

<p>
If you used <uri link="http://genkdesvn.mailstation.de">the genkdesvn
overlay</uri>, it's advisable that you remove the KDE pre-releases from your
system before upgrading.  For most users this should be as easy as running
<c>layman -d kde</c>. Also, if you modified any of the KDE related files in
<path>/etc/env.d/</path> you'll have to manually remove those. This can include previous modifications for beryl or compiz.
</p>

<section>
<title>Enabling the necessary USE flags</title>
<body>

<p>
KDE 4.0 requires <c>x11-libs/qt:4</c> built with a set of minimal USE flags.
Add the following line to your <path>/etc/portage/package.use</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting the necessary USE flags for x11-libs/qt:4">
x11-libs/qt:4 accessibility dbus gif jpeg png qt3support ssl zlib
</pre>

<p>
If you have the <c>opengl</c> USE flag set for KDE ebuilds, you'll have to set
the <c>opengl</c> USE flag for x11-libs/qt:4 too.
</p>

<note>
KDE 4.0.0 hasn't been tested with the Qt-4.4.0 technical preview, and at the
moment of writing the KDE 4.0.0 ebuilds do <c>NOT</c> work with this version
of Qt.
</note>

<section>
<title>Unmasking and keywording</title>
<body>

<p>
KDE 4.0.0 is currently hard-masked, so you will have to unmask it first before
you can emerge it. Users with <c>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86"</c> or
<c>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"</c> do not need to perform any other steps.  Any
other users will need to place the packages in package.keywords.<br/>
<path>/etc/portage/package.unmask/</path> and
<path>/etc/portage/package.keywords/</path> can be directories, so you can save
the following examples in those directories, to unmask and keyword KDE 4.0.0.
</p>

<p>
Example for <c>Split</c> ebuilds (recommended):
<uri
link="https://www2.mailstation.de/gitweb/?p=genkde4svn-pub.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/package.unmask-4.0.0-split;hb=HEAD">
package.unmask</uri>
		    <uri
link="https://www2.mailstation.de/gitweb/?p=genkde4svn-pub.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/package.keywords.4.0.0-split;hb=HEAD">
package.keywords</uri>
</p>

<p>
Example for <c>Monolithic</c> ebuilds:
<uri
link="https://www2.mailstation.de/gitweb/?p=genkde4svn-pub.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/package.unmask-4.0.0-mono;hb=HEAD">
package.unmask</uri>
<uri
link="https://www2.mailstation.de/gitweb/?p=genkde4svn-pub.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/package.keywords.4.0.0-mono;hb=HEAD">
package.keywords</uri>
</p>

<section>
<title>Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
You can now run either of the following emerge commands, to install KDE.
The first will give you all of KDE 4.0.0, built from split ebuilds.
</p>

<p>
The second will give you a minimal KDE 4.0.0 desktop, as a basis to add
only the programs you like.
</p>

<p>
The third command will build all of KDE, built from monolithic packages.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing KDE 4.0.0">
emerge -avD kde-base/kde-meta:kde-4
emerge -avD kde-base/kdebase-startkde:kde-4
emerge -avD kde-base/kde:kde-4
</pre>

<p>
To read more about the difference between split and monolithic ebuilds, see

Split Ebuilds HOWTO</uri>.

<chapter>
<title>Changes from KDE 3.5</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
KDE 4 represents a dramatic change in the desktop architecture to KDE 3.  One
such change is the migration from autotools to cmake. This means that you will
now have a percentage progress during the compilation of KDE.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>The startkde script</title>
<body>

<p>
It is not recommended to let KDE 3.5 and KDE 4.0 share the same configuration
files. To prevent that the startkde scripts rewrite the <path>~/.kde</path>
symlink while KDE starts. This means that when you're in a KDE 4.0 session your
configuration from KDE 3.5 will be unavailable and vice versa.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Because of this, you should not run two different KDE versions as the same user,
at the same time. (Logging in to KDE 4.0, while KDE 3.5 is still running in the
background, under the same user.)
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Selecting the login manager</title>
<body>

<p>
By default the highest version of kde-base/kdm you have installed will start on
login.  To configure this, open <path>/etc/conf.d/xdm</path> in your favorite
text editor and change the <c>DISPLAYMANAGER</c> variable to <c>kdm-3.5</c> or
<c>kdm-4.0</c>.  You can find possible versions for kdm by running <c>ls
<path>/usr/kde/</path></c> in a shell.
</p>

<pre caption="Add the following to /etc/conf.d/xdm">
DISPLAYMANAGER=kdm-3.5

<chapter>
<title>FAQ</title>
<section>
<title>Q: Can I install KDE 4.0 and KDE 3.5 at the same time?</title>
<body>

<p>
A: Yes, both versions are slotted, and can be installed at the same time.  Both
versions of KDE use a different KDEHOME, so you can try KDE 4.0 as the same
user, without overwriting your KDE 3.5 settings.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>
Q: You said I could install KDE 3.5 and KDE 4.0, but they block each other!
</title>
<body>

<p>
A: You will need to install the latest revision (not version) of
kde-base/kdebase (if you use monolithic ebuilds) or kde-base/kdebase-startkde
(if you use split ebuilds). These versions include patches to allow multiple
versions of KDE to coexist.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Q: Why is KDE 4.0.0 hard-masked?</title>
<body>

<p>
A: KDE 4.0.0 is very much a technology release. It was not intended to be a
complete replacement for the KDE 3 series, yet. Many features are missing and
many bugs will be found. When KDE 4.x is at the stage that it offers a true
upgrade path for users, it will leave the hard-masked status.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Q: Why is KDE 4.0.0 masked by EAPI?</title>
<body>

<p>
The KDE 4.0.0 ebuilds use slot dependencies, such as
<c>kde-base/kdebase-startkde:kde-4</c>, in the dependency syntax. You need a
version of portage that understands these.  If you get this mask message, you
should simply update portage to a sufficiently new version.
</p>

<pre caption="Updating to a version of portage that supports EAPI=1">
# <i>emerge --oneshot &gt;=sys-apps/portage-2.1.3.12</i>
</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Q: Where is KDE-PIM in KDE 4?</title>
<body>

<p>
KDE-PIM wasn't released with KDE 4.0.0, so unfortunately you won't find it in
the tree for a while. You can of course use the 3.5 versions of kmail, akregator
and their friends, together with KDE 4.0.0.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>
Q: I tried KDE4 and realized I don't want it anymore, what should I do to get
rid of it?
</title>
<body>

<p>
A: Remove KDE 4 from your <path>package.keywords</path> and
<path>package.unmask</path>, then uninstall the packages you installed.
Remember to update your DISPLAYMANAGER if you changed it to <c>kdm-4.0</c>
earlier.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Q: Does this mean KDE 3.5 will be gone soon?</title>
<body>

<p>
A: Not at all! KDE 3.5 is very stable, and still gets minor bugfixes from
upstream. While KDE 3.5 won't see new features anymore, we do plan on
maintaining it for a long time.
