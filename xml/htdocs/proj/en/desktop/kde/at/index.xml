<p>
As defined by <uri

a trustworthy user who is able to help with testing packages, identifying issues
and finding fixes.

<title>What you get</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
All HTs receive a <c>/gentoo/contributor/${NAME}</c> IRC cloak, are added to
the "Arch/Herd Tester" group on the <uri link="https://forums.gentoo.org/">
Gentoo forums</uri>, get auto-voice in <c>#gentoo-kde</c>, are added to the
<c>kde@gentoo.org</c> mail alias and are assigned <c>editbugs</c> privileges on
the <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Bugzilla</uri>.

<title>What to do</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
HTs usually test packages, provide guidance on bug reports, communicate with the
KDE team through the team's IRC channel (<c>#gentoo-kde</c>) and mail to the
<c>kde@gentoo.org</c> mail alias. HTs are also invited to help users on forums,
mailing lists and IRC channels.

<title>Requirements</title>

<p>
We expect people to do good testing, show good knowledge about Gentoo in general
and to be active (taking into account RL constraints).

<title>Participating</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
If you think your comments and patches submitted to Bugzilla and willingness to
help other users on IRC, mailinglists and/or forums justifies HT status you can
talk to the KDE herd. Users will also be invited to become HTs by members of the
KDE herd that notice their work, abilities and desire to help the KDE herd.
</p>

<p>
To become an HT, the user will have to complete the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/ebuild-quiz.txt">ebuild
quiz</uri> and have a review session with the AT lead (<mail
link="hparker@gentoo.org">hparker</mail>).
</p>

<p>
Interested users should read the <uri link="http://devmanual.gentoo.org/">Gentoo
Development Guide/DevManual</uri> and the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml">Gentoo
Developer Handbook</uri> and should work with the other members of the herd to
address the questions on the quiz. The KDE HT lead will work closely with all
HTs, helping them prepare for the quiz and the interview, and will coordinate
their work on the herd.
