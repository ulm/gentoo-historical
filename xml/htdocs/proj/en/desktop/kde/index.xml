	<longdescription>
<p>The kde project manages the qt ebuilds and kde ebuilds within gentoo. 
Currently that includes kde applications, but these are going to be put 
to function specific herds as the kde project can not maintain them 
properly as it are too many and the kde developers do not use many of 
the applications. The project does however still support the teams that 
do manage these applications, and will ensure that they use the kde 
eclass where appropriate.
