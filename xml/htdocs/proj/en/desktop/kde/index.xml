		The KDE project manages the Qt and KDE ebuilds within Gentoo.
	</description>

	<longdescription>
<p>The KDE project consists of two heards that manage the Qt and KDE ebuilds
within Gentoo, which include all KDE applications. However, some of the KDE applications
might belong to function specific herds due to the fact that the KDE project  
cannot maintain all of them properly. That is because there are too many applications
and many of them are not used by the KDE maintainers. Nevertheless, the project does 
support the teams that do manage these applications, and will ensure that they
use the KDE eclass where appropriate.
</p>

<goals>
	<p>The goal of the Gentoo KDE team is to provide working support for all
	packages supported by the KDE Project.  We also support as many underlying
	packages as necessary in order to have a properly working KDE environment.
