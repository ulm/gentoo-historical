<description>
The KDE project manages the KDE and Qt ebuilds within Gentoo.
</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
The KDE project consists of two herds that manage the KDE and Qt ebuilds
within Gentoo, which include all KDE applications. However, some KDE
applications might belong to function specific herds due to the fact that the
KDE project cannot maintain all of them properly, as there are too many
applications and many of them are not used by the KDE maintainers.
Nevertheless, the project does support the teams that do manage these
applications, and will ensure that they use the KDE eclasses appropriately.
</p>

</longdescription>

<goals>

<p>
The goal of the Gentoo KDE team is to provide working support for all packages
supported by the KDE Project. We also support as many underlying packages as
necessary in order to have a properly working KDE environment.

<title>Current situation</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The latest stable version of KDE in the official Portage Tree is
<b>3.5.8</b>. It has been marked stable on all stable-supporting architectures:
<b>alpha</b>, <b>amd64</b>, <b>hppa</b>, <b>ia64</b>, <b>ppc</b>,
<b>ppc64</b>, <b>sparc</b>, <b>x86</b>.
</p>

<note>
x86-fbsd currently has no stable packages and will therefore remain marked
testing/unstable. As of 2008.0 mips will only support ~arch so mips will not have 
any stable KDE packages.
</note>

<p>
If you're having problems updating to a KDE version >3.5.7, please read this <uri

<title>KDE 4</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
If you are a bold and daring Gentoo user, you might want to try the versions
of KDE 4 which are now in the main Portage tree and are masked. Note that KDE 4.0.x versions will
not be removed from <c>package.mask</c>.
</p>

<p>
The KDE herd maintains a KDE overlay for experimental releases and ebuilds,
mostly for KDE 4. You'll get all information about the overlay at the
official website which is located at <uri>http://genkdesvn.mailstation.de</uri>.
You can get support for these overlays in <uri
link="irc://irc.freenode.net/genkdesvn">#genkdesvn</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Currently, KDE 4 is in the main portage tree. Starting with KDE 4 we only support split ebuilds.
For those beyond bold and daring but rather suicidal, live SVN ebuilds are provided in the 
KDE overlay which you'll recognise by the version scm.<br/>
These -scm ebuilds use a new EAPI, wittingly called kdebuild-1, which is currently exclusively
supported by the package manager <uri link="http://paludis.pioto.org">Paludis</uri>.<br/>
If you're interested in the new features you can find <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/kde/kdebuild-1.xml">our official kdebuild-1 page here.</uri>
</p>

<note>
Neither Portage nor pkgcore currently support the kdebuild-1 EAPI. Please inform their respective authors if you'd like
them to implement support for it. The Gentoo KDE team will gladly provide any help we can.

<title>Support and assistance</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
There are several ways to get support with KDE related issues. You can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Join <uri link="irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo-kde">#gentoo-kde</uri> on the
    Freenode IRC network. You'll find some of the herd members there most of
    the time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Address your concerns in the Gentoo Forums. Not all of us are avid forums
    users but many experienced users and some developers are likely to be able
    to help you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Of course, you can also file a bug report at Gentoo's Bugzilla (do not
    forget to add your <c>emerge --info</c> and the output of <c>emerge -pv
    &lt;package&gt;</c>).
  </li>
  <li>
    For your convenience, we provide a few documents about how to install KDE
    on Gentoo:

<title>How *you* can help</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The main thing that needs doing is trawling through the current open bugs and
finding those that are stale, or those that have an equivalent on <uri
link="https://bugs.kde.org">KDE's Bugzilla</uri>.
</p>

<p>
You'll find a current list of open bugs here:
<uri>http://tinyurl.com/3bpdlv</uri>.
</p>

<p>
For those that are stale, you should ask if on the bug if the problem remains in
the latest version. If someone has already done this and the reporter (or
someone else experiencing the same problem) has not replied it should be marked
NEEDINFO.
</p>

<p>
Also, some bugs have been filed from people using the sabayon overlay or others.
These need to be reproduced by someone using vanilla ebuilds (i.e.,
not from an unstable overlay). Pointing this out on the bug is likely to prompt
one of us to close it as INVALID until someone can reproduce it. It would also
be nice if you could ask the reporter to report it to that overlay's bug
tracker. For Sabayon it's <uri>http://bugs.sabayonlinux.org</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of bugs - now you can become a Herd Tester, too! You'll find all the
necessary information about what a Herd Tester is and does on the <uri
link="/proj/en/desktop/kde/at/">KDE Herd Testers Project Page</uri>.
</p>

<note>
To become an HT, please read the <uri
link="/proj/en/desktop/kde/at/">document</uri> and contact the current KDE HT
lead, <mail link="jmbsvicetto@gentoo.org">jmbsvicetto</mail>.
</note>

<p>
Finally, it would be great to chat to you on IRC, too - this is how we normally
get to know each other. Please drop into <uri
link="irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo-kde">#gentoo-kde</uri> and chat with us. If
you have any problems or questions, feel free to /query individual team members
or ask in <uri link="irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo-kde">#gentoo-kde</uri>, <uri
link="irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo-desktop">#gentoo-desktop</uri> or <uri
link="irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo">#gentoo</uri>.
