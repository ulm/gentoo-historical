	</description>

	<longdescription>
<p>The kde project manages the qt ebuilds and kde ebuilds within gentoo. 
Currently this includes all kde applications. However, the kde 
applications will be put into function specific herds as the kde project  
can not maintain them properly as there are too many. Further many of 
the applications are not used by the kde maintainers. The project does 
however still support the teams that do manage these applications, and 
will ensure that they use the kde eclass where appropriate.
</p>

<goals>
	<p>The goal of the Gentoo KDE team is to provide working support for all
	packages supported by the KDE Project.  We also support as many underlying
	packages as necessary in order to have a properly working KDE environment.
