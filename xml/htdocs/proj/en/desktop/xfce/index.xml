The Gentoo Xfce Project aims to bring the current and complete Xfce desktop
environment to Gentoo.

<!-- list what you do, and what your long term goals are -->
<p>
<uri link="http://www.xfce.org">Xfce</uri> is a fast, lightweight desktop
environment for Unix-like operating systems. It is designed for productivity,
and is quite configurable while still adhering to the <uri
link="http://www.freedesktop.org/">Freedesktop</uri> specifications.
</p>

<p>
Unlike heavier desktop environments, such as Gnome and KDE, Xfce uses far fewer
system resources. Additionally, it offers greater modularity and fewer
dependencies; it takes up less space on your hard disk and takes less time to
install.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo Xfce Project aims to bring the current and complete Xfce desktop
environment to Gentoo. We maintain the Xfce libraries, key applications, and
various add-ons that are part of the Xfce desktop.

<longdescription>

<p>
Now that the upstream developers have released version 4.4, we need to finish
adding the various packages to Portage. It has recently been unmasked. The next
step is to get it all stabilized. However, this requires a good amount of
testing on as many arches as possible.

Thankfully, there aren't too many. Still, any and all assistance in tracking
down, resolving, and closing these bugs is great appreciated. Your help leads
to a better Xfce desktop.
