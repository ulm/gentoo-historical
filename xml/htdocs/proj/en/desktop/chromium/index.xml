      <details>
        Chromium in Gentoo project needs more people testing packages.
        We are not always able to reproduce reported issues, and having
        more people respond to testing requests would be useful.
        No quiz is necessary to start.
      </details>
      <requirements>
        If you are running Chromium or working with V8,
        and are willing to spend some time helping Gentoo,
        feel free to apply.

      <summary>Developer</summary>
      <details>
        We have ambitious plans to start maintaining more chromium-related
        packages like V8. We could also create some Gentoo-specific
        documentation for people who would like to contribute to or hack on
        the upstream project. To complete those tasks, we may need more
        manpower.
      </details>
      <requirements>
        Being a Gentoo developer who wants to join the project. Moderate
        knowledge of upstream project. Being a committer of the upstream
        project would be a huge plus.

      <title>What is the difference between Google Chrome and Chromium?</title>
      <body>

    <section>
      <title>Why are dev channel releases hard masked?</title>
      <body>
        <p>Dev channel releases are for developers and people who want more
        experimental features and accept more unstable software. It also allows
        you to choose the channel you want to be on (dev = hard masked,
        beta = ~arch, stable = arch).</p>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Aren't dev channel releases just weekly snapshots?</title>
      <body>
        <p>No, each release goes through QA first. It's not uncommon to delay
        a release because of increased crashiness or other instability.</p>
      </body>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Where can I find more info about the releases?</title>

        I am getting an error message like "libffmpegsumo.so: cannot open
        shared object file: Permission denied". Is something broken?
      </title>
      <body>
        <p>No, actually it is a result of using system version of ffmpeg
        instead of the bundled one.</p>
      </body>

    <section>
      <title>
        The browser fails to compile with an error like
        "fatal error: libavcore/samplefmt.h: No such file or directory".
      </title>
      <body>
        <p>Are you using <c>media-video/ffmpeg-9999</c>? Try downgrading
        ffmpeg. Sometimes the project makes incompatible changes and the
        projects using the library take some time to adjust.</p>
