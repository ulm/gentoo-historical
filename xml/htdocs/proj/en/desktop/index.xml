distribution, including science. This involves both researching the
improvements needed for Gentoo's use as a desktop as managing all projects that

<title>Lead Elections</title>
<section>
<body>
	<p>
	We're going to hold elections for a new lead (or possibly co-leads) soon.
	More info coming at a future date. Discuss this further in either
	#gentoo-desktop or on the gentoo-desktop mailing list.
	</p>

	<p>
	Any developers who consider themselves part of the desktop project are
	welcome to participate in the election, but they can't just be part of the
	project for the election. They need to create a subproject with accompanying
	Web page for their herd and link to it from the top-level desktop index. Any
	developers not listed as members on some project page in the desktop
	hierarchy cannot vote.
