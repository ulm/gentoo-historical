	<p>We're always interested by users, who want to contribute.
        If you want to get involved with improving Gentoo's desktop effects experience, we'd
	like to hear from you! The main thing you'll want to do is be active on
	<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo's Bugzilla</uri>.
	A good start is to provide patches or ebuilds to bug reports that have already been filed by other users.</p> 
	<p>Also please join desktop-effects project members in #gentoo-desktop-effects on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<title>Official overlay</title>
<body>
	<p>We maintain an overlay called <uri link="http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/desktop-effects.git;a=summary">
	desktop-effects</uri> in layman. It contains additional applications, as well as snapshot and live ebuilds for compiz stuff.
	Things there are considered not stable enough for the main tree, but are used for testing. You can help us with testing these ebuilds.</p>
