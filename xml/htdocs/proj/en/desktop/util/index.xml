<longdescription>
  The Desktop Utilities project manages a wide variety of small utilities and
  dockapps for the Gentoo Desktop. Utilities include any small programs that
  make the desktop easier or more fun to use. Dockapps include similar programs
  that fit into the dock/slit/wharf of your desktop's wm.

<goals>
  The goal of the WM project is to support all desktop utilities in Portage.
