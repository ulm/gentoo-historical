<longdescription>
	The Games project manages all games that are added into the Portage
	tree.  We're the guys that put the fun into Gentoo.  We also manage a few
	utilites that are used heavily in many games, such as the SDL* libraries.
</longdescription>

<goals>
	The games project aims to turn Gentoo into the premiere Linux gaming
	platform.  We strive to have the best compatability not only for free
	games, but also for commercial titles.
