		Desktop Gentoo&#39;s purpose is to improve Gentoo desktop experience, by researching
		how existing features can be improved or corrected, by trying to make desktop components work
		better together, and by eventually developping new components. This project is intended to be 
		a team of gentoo developpers, spending their time in auditing the Gentoo desktop experience in
		a general manner, to find places wher it can be improved. Each time things can be improved,
		a corresponding task is designed and planed.
