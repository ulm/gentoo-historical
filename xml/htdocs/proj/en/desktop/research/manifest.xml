<section>
<title>Desktop issue definition</title>
<body>
<p>
An issue is related to the desktop if it is : client side or end-user oriented
workstation use. Basically, that's everything UI oriented, plus hardware
management, installation problems as well as simple system management.
Basically, if it is client side and doesn't use servers, it is our
responsability.

<title>Problems Resolution</title>

<section>
<title>Exploration phase</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>GOAL</b> : <e>describe and decide</e>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>throw a description here, verify validity</li>
  <li>preliminary discussion here and/or irc</li>
  <li><e>Optional</e> : Prepare a prototype, testcase or a little code snippet    
to let everybody play</li>
  <li>talk with the devs that are the most concerned with the issue, get additional
information, ask if there is a good reason not to handle it, inform them that plan to
address a GLEP</li>
  <li><b>APPROVAL 1 </b> : Is it worth pursuing this proposal? The result
should be written to the mailing list and on the xml project page if  
we decide to handle the case.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Draft phase</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>GOAL</b> : <e>have a GLEP draft</e>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>add new tasks : at least some time to research further (with a
  milestone), and some time to find a solution (with milestone)</li>
  <li>one of the task should be GLEP writing. Possibly one people should
take care that the draft is conforming to GLEP standard</li>
  <li>assign people to the task, set up deadlines. People assigned should include
as most as possible external devs that are concerned by the issue, so that the
GLEP get discussed</li>
  <li>all this should be well written in the xml project pages, and  
should end with a new and shiny GLEP draft</li>
  <li><b>APPROVAL 2</b> : do we all (at desktop-research + involved devs) agree on the
draft?</li>
</ul>
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>GLEP submission</title>
<body>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>we submit the GLEP to the responsible entity, so that they approve it, or not</li>
</ul>
</p>

<title>Additional precisions</title>
<section>
<title>XML project pages precisions</title>
<body>
<p>
Their main goal is to organize the work, and archive what's been done. They
should be the canvas to the GLEP and development production. devs assigned to
some task are responsible of it, and thus should maintain their task on the
project pages.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>GLEP precision</title>
<body>
<p>The GLEP should contain contain the key parts of the
discussions from the discussion phase, problem identification (what is  
the problem), problem acceptation (is this really a problem),
problem exploration (what are the causes and possible solutions to  
the problem) , proposed solution and the merits of this particular  
solution. The latter of course from later discussions.

<section>
<title>Behaviour</title>
<body>
<p>
We'll try to work together in a peacefull and friendly manner, so no use to be
strict for every points. Nevertheless, rules are still usefull for extreme
situations.
