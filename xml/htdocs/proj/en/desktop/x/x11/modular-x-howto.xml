<title>Why modular?</title>
<body>

<p>
You may be wondering, why in the world did one nice, easy xorg-x11 package turn
into almost 300 separate ones? And you'd certainly be justified in this. =)
It's not something Gentoo is doing independently of upstream X.Org; they're
splitting up all the packages into separate releases, and we're just following
along.
</p>

<p>
The reasoning behind the split and changing build system is at least threefold:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
X is too difficult to get into for new devs, so thus the move to autotools, a
system more people are comfortable with if not happy with.
</li>
<li>
Along with that move, splitting out the source is possible with autotools, and
this also makes it more developer-friendly.
</li>
<li>
Things have been unnecessarily tied together in the past, and this has made
getting bugfixes out often impossible. If they were able to get out fixes, it
required rebuilding all of XOrg. For example, a bug in the ati driver would
either need to wait 6 months until the next release, or you'd have to rebuild
your fonts to get it, for absolutely no reason.
</li>
</ul>

<title>Migrating to Modular X</title>

<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
To keep old packages from getting in the way, we're going to clean out all the
old xorg-x11 cruft before installing modular X. This isn't absolutely crucial,
but it will help ensure a smooth migration.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>First step: Clean out your old X</title>
<body>
		
<p>
Create a backup copy of the monolithic xorg-x11 in case modular X works poorly
for you, and you want to revert to 6.x.
</p>

<pre caption="Backing up the old xorg-x11">
# <i>emerge gentoolkit</i>
# <i>quickpkg xorg-x11</i>
</pre>

<p>
Get rid of the monolithic installation:
</p>

<pre caption="Unmerging the monolitic installation">
# <i>emerge -Ca xorg-x11 virtual/x11</i>
</pre>

<p>
If your <path>/usr/X11R6</path> isn't a symlink to <path>/usr</path>, delete it
and start from scratch. But first, save a list of all the packages installing
there. The <c>gentoolkit</c> package provides <c>equery</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Make a package list">
# <i>if [[ ! -L /usr/X11R6 ]]; \
	then equery belongs /usr/X11R6 > ~/usr-x11r6-packages \
	&amp;&amp; rm -rf /usr/X11R6; fi</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Second step: Installing modular X</title>
<body>
		
<p>
If you are running a stable system and the modular X version you want is not yet
stable for your architecture, add the required packages to
<path>/etc/portage/package.keywords</path>. Download the
<uri link="modular-x-packages.txt">package list</uri>, and open it in a text
editor of your choice. Copy and paste the full modular X mask over to
<path>package.keywords</path>. If none of that made any sense, read the
<uri link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=3&amp;chap=3">handbook section on masking</uri>.
</p>

<note>
Do not do this if you are using binary drivers or if there isn't a specific
reason you need 7.1 rather than 7.0. Binary drivers are not yet compatible
with X.Org 7.1.
</note>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Other packages that may require package.keywords for stable users</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>&gt;=sys-apps/portage-2.1_pre4</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>=sys-apps/man-1.6b-r2</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>app-admin/eselect-opengl</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>&gt;=app-admin/eselect-1.0_rc1</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>media-video/nvidia-kernel</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>media-video/nvidia-glx</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
For direct rendering, check that the <c>dri</c> USE flag is active. It should
be on by default.
</p>

<p>
Next, decide which drivers you need to install. This will vary depending on your
input and video hardware. If you already have a working
<path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path>, then just run this command to get an idea of
what drivers you need:
</p>

<pre caption="Finding what drivers you need">
# <i>grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf</i>
		Driver      "kbd"
		Driver      "mouse"
		Driver      "radeon"
</pre>

<pre caption="Checking available drivers">
# <i>emerge --verbose --pretend xorg-x11</i>
[ebuild   R   ] x11-base/xorg-x11-7.0-r1  USE="-xprint" INPUT_DEVICES="keyboard
mouse -acecad -aiptek -calcomp -citron -digitaledge -dmc -dynapro -elo2300
-elographics -evdev -fpit -hyperpen -jamstudio -joystick -magellan -magictouch
-microtouch -mutouch -palmax -penmount -spaceorb -summa -synaptics% -tek4957
-ur98 -vmmouse -void" VIDEO_CARDS="i128 mga radeon savage -apm -ark -chips
-cirrus -cyrix -dummy -fbdev -fglrx% -glint -i740 -i810 -imstt -mach64 -neomagic
-newport -nsc -nv -nvidia% -r128 -rendition -s3 -s3virge -siliconmotion -sis
-sisusb -sunbw2 -suncg14 -suncg3 -suncg6 -sunffb -sunleo -suntcx -tdfx -tga
-trident -tseng -v4l -vesa -vga -via -vmware -voodoo" 0 kB
</pre>

<p>
Set INPUT_DEVICES and VIDEO_CARDS to what you need in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>. The minimal setting for the above example would be
INPUT_DEVICES="<c>keyboard mouse</c>" VIDEO_CARDS="<c>radeon</c>". If you don't
set one or the other variable, xorg-x11 will pull in all possible drivers of
that type. For backup drivers, you may also want to add <c>vesa</c> and
<c>fbdev</c> to VIDEO_CARDS.
</p>

<p>
Now, install the metabuild. This will install the server and popular
applications, giving you a working desktop implementation of X:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing the modular metabuild">
# <i>emerge xorg-x11</i>
# <i>etc-update</i>
# <i>revdep-rebuild</i>
# <i>[[ -e ~/usr-x11r6-packages ]] &amp;&amp; emerge $(&lt;~/usr-x11r6-packages)</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you really want a minimal installation, just install <c>xorg-server</c>.
This will pull in only what you need to start an X server.
</note>

<p>
This install tries to be rather minimal, so things like xcursor-themes
are not installed by default. In that particular example, you would want
xcursor-themes if you changed your cursor setting to whiteglass, redglass or
handhelds. If you use the gentoo, gentoo-blue or gentoo-silver cursor themes,
install gentoo-xcursors.
</p>

<note>
With modular installed, external drivers such as nvidia-glx and wacom as well as
some vnc apps may not work if they install things to
<path>/usr/lib/modules</path> instead of <path>/usr/lib/xorg/modules</path>.
Many of these will have modular X detection added to the installation process
and thus will need to be re-merged after modular X install. In addition, many
external drivers have a <c>dlloader</c> USE flag that you must enable and then
rebuild the drivers.
</note>

<chapter>
<title>Caveats/Common Problems</title>
<section>
<title>'emerge -u world' wants to install xorg-x11 6.x or virtual/x11</title>
<body>

<p>
This is because the tree isn't fixed for modular dependencies yet. You can help
the porting effort by reading the <uri
link="porting-modular-x-howto.xml">Porting
to Modular X HOWTO</uri> and filing bugs with patches to the individual package
maintainers. The  maintainers will be listed in <path>metadata.xml</path> in the
same directory as the package and the <c>herdstat</c> package will speed up
querying for them.
</p>

<p>
Particularly if you are running modular X on an otherwise stable system, you
may run into issues with this. Many packages only work with modular X in their
~arch versions, so you may need to add additional packages to
<path>/etc/portage/package.keywords</path>.
</p>

<section>
<title>What happened to all the USE flags?</title>
<body>

<p>
Many USE flags in the xorg-x11-6.8 series vanished or moved in 7.0. Some new
USE flags appeared. Here's why:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>USE flag</th>
	<th>What happens in 7.0?</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>3dfx</ti>
	<ti>In 7.0, pulls in glide-v3 from the xorg-x11 metabuild</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>3dnow, mmx, sse</ti>
	<ti>Enabled by default at build time, because there are runtime checks</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>bitmap-fonts, truetype-fonts, type1-fonts</ti>
	<ti>
		The xorg-x11 metabuild pulls in a small selection of the most used or
		required fonts. You may additionally install any others in media-fonts/.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>cjk</ti>
	<ti>
		USE=nls on font-misc-misc and font-sony-misc to get Japanese JISX0201
		fonts. More are in font-jis-misc. Chinese fonts are in font-isas-misc.
		Korean fonts are in font-daewoo-misc.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>dlloader</ti>
	<ti>7.0 uses the dlloader by default, and the elfloader doesn't work.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>doc</ti>
	<ti>Moved to app-doc/xorg-docs</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>dmx</ti>
	<ti>Built in xorg-server unless USE=minimal</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>font-server</ti>
	<ti>You may manually install xfs.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>ipv6</ti>
	<ti>Moved to individual packages using it. Set globally if you want it.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>minimal</ti>
	<ti>
		To get the same effect, install just xorg-server rather than xorg-x11.
		USE=minimal on xorg-server to avoid building Xdmx, Xvfb and Xnest.
		If you require something more minimal, look into x11-base/kdrive.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>nls</ti>
	<ti>In 7.0, USE=nls installs all non-ISO8859-1 versions of fonts.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>nocxx</ti>
	<ti>Not yet an equivalent in 7.0</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>opengl</ti>
	<ti>
		Changed names to "dri," which enables direct rendering in xorg-server
		and many drivers. Whether USE=dri is on or off, you should still get
		software 3D via Mesa.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>pam</ti>
	<ti>Moved to individual packages using it, such as xorg-server and xdm</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>sdk</ti>
	<ti>7.0 must install the SDK as a consequence of modularization.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>static</ti>
	<ti>
		Mostly doesn't make much sense to try building a static server in a
		modular world, because the driver can't be built into it.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>xprint</ti>
	<ti>
		On metabuild, pulls in libXp. On other applications, builds in xprint
		support. Most people will not want to enable this.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>xv</ti>
	<ti>
		No longer optional because it doesn't save much size and causes other
		issues with some packages expecting it.
	</ti>
</tr>

<p>
If you installed modular X on a fresh Gentoo installation, you may not have a 
<path>/usr/X11R6</path> -&gt; <path>/usr</path> symlink. The
<c>x11-base/xorg-x11</c> package will ensure that the symlink exists during
the emerge process.
</p>

<p>
You can help get things out of <path>/usr/X11R6</path> by fixing the packages
that install there and filing bugs. Also, remember to reinstall these packages.
</p>

<title>XKB doesn't work, I can't switch VTs, etc</title>
<body>

<ul>
	<li>
		Many XKB layouts have moved around, consolidated or disappeared. Take a look
		in <path>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/</path> to see what happened to your
		old XkbLayout settings in xorg.conf. For example, to replace the old
		"us_intl" layout, you would put <c>"XkbLayout" "latin"</c>,
		<c>"XkbOptions"	"lv3:ralt_switch"</c>. To replace the old "sk_qwerty"
		layout, you would put <c>"XkbLayout" "sk"</c>, <c>"XkbVariant"
		"qwerty"</c>. For a more advanced example, perhaps you have
		<c>"XkbLayout" "us,sk_qwerty"</c>. To get that working, the new setting
		would be <c>"XkbLayout" "us,sk"</c>, and the tricky part is in the
		comma here: <c>"XkbVariant" ",qwerty"</c>, because you want the variant
		to apply to your second layout.
	</li>
</ul>

<pre caption="Tracking down XKB changes">
<comment>Check /var/log/Xorg.0.log for this message:</comment>
<comment>(WW) Couldn't load XKB keymap, falling back to pre-XKB keymap</comment>
<comment>If you do not have that error, your XKB works already.</comment>

        Option "XkbModel"  "logibik"
        Option "XkbLayout"  "dvorak"
        Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps"
<comment>First, see what changed with your layout. This is in the symbols/pc directory.</comment>
# <i>cd /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/</i>
<comment>If you have xkbdata instead of xkeyboard-config installed, change to the pc/ subdirectory.</comment>
# <i>ls *dvorak*</i>
<comment>OK, nothing showed up.</comment>
<comment>Lots of old layouts moved into their country-coded keymaps.</comment>
# <i>ls *us*</i>
us
<comment>Now, we check for an xkb_symbols variant called dvorak.</comment>
# <i>grep xkb_symbols.*dvorak us</i>
xkb_symbols "dvorak" {
<comment>That means in xorg.conf, we need Option "XkbLayout" "us"</comment>
<comment>and Option "XkbVariant" "dvorak".</comment>

<comment>But when we try to test this with setxkbmap, we still get an error</comment>
# <i>setxkbmap -model logibik -layout us -variant dvorak -option "ctrl:swapcaps"</i>
<comment>Maybe the model changed, too.</comment>
# <i>cd /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/</i>
