<warn>
Please note that <c>ati-drivers</c> are bad at uninstalling themselves and might
leave the <c>fglrx.ko</c> module in your
<path>/lib/modules/*kernel*/video/</path> folder. If this file resides on your
system after uninstalling <c>ati-drivers</c>, please remove it.

<title>Getting 2D acceleration to work</title>
<body>

<p>
To get working 2D acceleration, we have to specify which graphic card we use in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="Adding the radeon driver to make.conf">
# <i>echo 'VIDEO_CARDS="radeon"' >> /etc/make.conf</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now that our environment is setup, re-emerge all the packages that use the
VIDEO_CARDS variable.
</p>

<pre caption="Reemerging all required packages">
# <i>emerge -avuDN world </i>
</pre>

<note>
This also update your system, so if you don't want to do so just drop the
<c>-u</c> option.
</note>

<p>
Next step is a bit tricky, because we have to correctly configure
<path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path>.
</p>

<note>
If you are using <c>x11-base/xorg-server-1.6</c> or newer, then you can just
simply remove <path>xorg.conf</path> and skip this step.
</note>

<p>
First, open the file <path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path> in your favorite editor.
Second, search for the section containing <c>Driver "fglrx"</c>.  Third, remove
everything in this section except the <c>Driver</c> and <c>Identifier</c> bits.
Now replace <c>"fglrx"</c> with <c>"radeon"</c>.  More options for this driver
can be found by reading <c>man radeon</c>.
</p>

Section "Device"
	VendorName	"ATI"
	Identifier	"X700OS"
	Driver		"radeon"

<title>Getting 3D acceleration to work</title>
<body>

<p>
ATI's binary driver uses its own kernel module and OpenGL implementation.
However, the open-source driver has the kernel module included in the kernel
by default and needs just enabling.
</p>

<p>
To configure the kernel simply run <c>make menuconfig</c> in
<path>/usr/src/linux</path> and enable the following options as modules:
</p>

<pre caption="Enable the correct modules in the kernel">
Device Drivers ->
    Graphics support ->
        [M] Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and Higher DRI support) ->
            [M] ATI Radeon
</pre>

<p>
After enabling those options just quit the configuration manager and run <c>make
&amp;&amp; make modules_install</c> to get those installed.
</p>

<p>
To use this module just type as root <c>modprobe radeon</c> or add the
<c>radeon</c> module to the the correct config file so that it is loaded
automatically on boot, such as <path>/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6</path>
or <path>/etc/conf.d/modules</path> (if you're using OpenRC and
<c>baselayout-2</c>).
</p>

<warn>
If you had your <c>fglrx</c> module loaded, you can't just <c>rmmod</c> it and
load the <c>radeon</c> module. This leads to memory corruption and kernel panic.
To get rid of the <c>fglrx</c> module you'll have to reboot your computer.
