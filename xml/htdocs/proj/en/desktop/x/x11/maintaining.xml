<p>
X is one of the more complex and critical maintainer's jobs in Gentoo. There's
a lot to figure out before one can do it properly. This guide attempts to lead
a new X maintainer down one path to keeping sanity.

<p>
The first thing to do is to get in contact with upstream. One of the pathways
is mailing lists. You'll want to subscribe to all of these.

<p>
This section provides the general guidelines on being a chairperson.

Prior to the meeting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive agenda items of the forthcoming meeting from all attendees.</li>
<li>Email the core mailing list with the agenda of the forthcoming meeting no later than 24 hours in advance of the meeting.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the meeting flowing. This means maintaining focus on the agenda and
the objectives of the meeting.</li>
<li>Keep the meeting within its allotted time frame (usually one hour)</li>
<li>Allow the presentation of an agenda item by the person responsible for
that item, before any questions and discussion is undertaken.</li>
<li>Get responses from all members before moving onto the next agenda
item.</li>
<li>Briefly summarize unresolved business. This may include the result of
the discussion, specific actions that are to be taken, who's responsible for
working on what etc.</li>
<li>Allow all attendees to be able to discuss their concerns after the
agenda items have been discussed.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email the meeting log to the gentoo-core mailing list within a specified
period.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Chairperson is expected tro maintain neutrality throughout the meeting.
If the chairperson feels, upon receipt of the agenda items (to be discussed
below), that they are strongly attached to the outcome of the discussion,
we leave it on their honour to remove themselves from the Chair and let
an alternate person chair the meeting.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Managers' Roles</title>
<body>
<p>
Managers also have a role to play.  Their expectations are outlined below.

Prior to the meeting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pesent agenda items to the chairperson no later than 3 days in advance.
Special consideration to emergency items will be given, and at the
chairperson's discretion, last minute agenda items may be added.</li>
<li>Read agenda items of fellow attendees and prepare comments on them.
This may involve reading a <uri
link="http://glep.gentoo.org/">GLEP</uri>.</li>
<li>Clear calendar around meeting time, and arrive on time (Seemant!)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freely share their ideas on the topics at hand and be open to others'
perspectives.</li>
<li>Act in a friendly and professional manner. The meeting may give the
chairperson a lasting impression on how Gentoo is run, and will definitely
leave an impression on your fellow developers.</li>
<li>Understand that the chairperson is the governing authority for the
meeting.  When the chair has determined that the next agenda item should be
discussed, the managers should concede.  Any open items needing further
discussion may be rescheduled for a subsequent meeting or discussed more
widely on the gentoo-core mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Attendees' Roles</title>
<body>
<p>
During the discussion, the channel will be moderated.  However, the final
agenda item for every single meeting is a free-flow question and answer
session.  This is the time for developers to query and discuss issues
brought up during the meeting.  Please be forthcoming about your concerns,
because as a developer, your voice is important!
</p>
<p>
If you have an urgent question or other input that hinges on the flow of the
current agenda item, please send an IRC /msg to the Chairperson, so that
they may forward your question onto the floor.
</p>
<p>
During the question and answer session, please be mindful that many people
will want to ask questions. That being the case, please avoid repetition of
questions.  Again, the rules of civility do govern all.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Universal Expectations</title>
<body>
<p>The following rules apply to <b>everybody</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do <b>NOT</b> criticize people.</li>
<li>Other's ideas should be respected. This doesn't mean that you have to
agree, but rather that you have to listen.</li>
<li>Keep an open mind.</li>
<li>Ask questions when you do not understand something and be tolerant of
those who ask questions.</li>
<li>Help the chairperson by keeping the discussion focused on the issues at
hand.  Digression should be minimised.</li>
<li>Do <b>NOT</b> leave issues hanging. Assign responsibility for each
action to be taken.</li>
</ul>
</body>

<chapter>
<title>Preparation for Meetings</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Gentoo's <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel">Developer
Relations personnel</uri> is responsible for selecting the chairperson for
upcoming managers' meetings.  The chair will be announced no later than one
week in advance of a meeting.  The proposed chair will be contacted prior to
that and upon receipt of their consent, the announcement will be made to the
core mailing list.  Managers are then responsible for informing the
chairperson of their agenda items.
</p>
<p>The selection of the chairperson, during the initial phase of this new
system will be made carefully by the DevRel personnel.  We are attempting to
choose people based on: the length of time they have been with the project,
their record of maturity and level-headedness, their neutrality of the
issues, and their willingness and consent.  Additionally, a chair person can <b>NOT</b> be a top level manager.
</p>
<p>Once the initial test phase of this system is successful, chairpersons will
be chosen fairly at random from a pool of developers who have been with the
project for a minimum of three (3) months
</p>
<p>Each meeting will have an objective.  That is to say, each agenda item
will have an objective, be it to gain consensus from all the managers or to
assign a prioritised list of actions for ideas, etc.

<title>TODO</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Please direct your feedback to <mail link="devrel@gentoo.org">the DevRel
team</mail> on this document.  It is a work in progress, still.  Some things
that we would like to accomplish is a centralised mail alias for the
chairperson, and a posting of the agenda items on the website somewhere.
</p>
<p>Meetings are currently scheduled on a Monday at 1800 UTC.  It would be
desirable to have alternating days or times to allow as many developers and
managers to attend.
