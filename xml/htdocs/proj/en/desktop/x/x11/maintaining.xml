<title>Introduction</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
X is one of the more complex and critical maintainer's jobs. There's a lot to
figure out before one can do it properly. This guide attempts to lead a new X
maintainer down one path to keeping sanity.

<section>
<title>Mailing Lists</title>
<body>

<p>
The first thing to do is to get in contact with upstream. One of the pathways
is mailing lists. You'll probably want to subscribe to all of these.
</p>

<section>
<title>IRC Channels</title>
<body>

<p>
A great medium for generating some camaraderie with upstream and other
packagers is IRC. Making connections is a good way to get things accomplished.
Unless specified otherwise, all these are on irc.freenode.net.

<title>Handling Bugs</title>
<section>
<title>Queries</title>
<body>
<p>
Before you can start dealing with bugs, you need to have good ways to find which
ones you want to deal with. I have 10 X-related queries saved in my Bugzilla
settings: <c>X Security</c>, <c>X blocker</c>, <c>X critical</c>,
<c>X major</c>, <c>X minor</c>, <c>X trivial</c>, <c>X inclusion</c>,
<c>X CC</c>, <c>X</c> and <c>X enhancements</c>. The <c>X</c> query is: All bugs
with Status UNCONFIRMED NEW ASSIGNED REOPENED where severity is everything
except enhancement and bug owner is <mail>x11@gentoo.org</mail>. The <c>X
enhancements</c> query is the same but with the severity set only to
enhancement. Similar holds true for other severity-related queries. <c>X CC</c>
is all open bugs that <mail>x11@gentoo.org</mail> is CC'd on. <c>X inclusion</c>
is all open bugs assigned to <mail>x11@gentoo.org</mail> with <c>Keywords:
Inclusion</c>. This is used to create a short list of ready-to-go commits with
attached patches or very obvious changes. <c>X Security</c> is a list of all
open bugs with either assignee or CC <mail>x11@gentoo.org</mail> and either
assignee or CC <mail>security@gentoo.org</mail>.
</p>

<p>
You may wish to divide the bugs up better, but first realize this: Bug
priorities are not well-triaged at this point in time (2 May 2007), so
restricting the priority is a very artificial way to do things. After you
enter this search into the advanced page, you'll be able to save it from the
bottom of the results page.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Triage</title>
<body>
<p>
As soon as you have time after reading your Bugzilla emails, you should go to
the bug URL and glance briefly over the bug. In this time, you should be able to
figure out whether: (a) the bug is assigned to the right people, (b) any other
people should be CC'd, (c) the bug is not obviously invalid and (d) the system
isn't overoptimized. From (d), it follows that you'll need <c>emerge info</c> to
diagnose the problem in nearly all cases, so you get CFLAGS and the toolchain.
</p>

<p>If the bug appears valid and should be assigned to us, then classify the
severity. The basis for this is:</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Severity</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>blocker</ti>
	<ti>It breaks entire systems, causes data loss, prevents booting, etc.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>critical</ti>
	<ti>Compilation failures that don't appear to be corner cases, unavoidable
		crashes, X not starting</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>major</ti>
	<ti>Significant runtime issues that render X useless</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>normal</ti>
	<ti>Most bugs will fall under this.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>minor</ti>
	<ti>Bugs that don't significantly affect use and have a workaround</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>trivial</ti>
	<ti>Bugs that result in nearly no end-user or developer change. For
		example, prettifying some code in the ebuild, small docs typos, etc.
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>enhancement</ti>
	<ti>Feature requests, new packages, etc. Version bumps do <b>not</b> fall
		under this. They should probably be "normal."</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Also classify the priority. The basis for this is:</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Priority</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>P1</ti>
	<ti>Must-fix</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>P2</ti>
	<ti>Might-fix</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>P3</ti>
	<ti>Probably won't fix</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>P4</ti>
	<ti>Won't fix unless there are no other open bugs and nothing else to do
	</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
	<ti>RESOLVED-&gt;WONTFIX</ti>
	<ti>Won't fix, period
	</ti>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Bug-fixing</title>
<body>

<p>
Once you've got all the open X bugs triaged, you can start fixing them. It's
vital to remember that you need to split your time between <b>all</b> levels of
severity. There will always be more critical bugs coming in, and if you never
work on anything lower unless there are no critical bugs, you'll never work on
anything lower. You don't need to split your time evenly -- just split it.
</p>

<p>
Just start looking through all priority-1 bugs. Ignore anything priority-2 and
lower until all priority-1 bugs are fixed. Always be alert for mis-classified
bugs while you're browsing the list of open bugs, whether they're over- or
under-prioritized. The same goes for severity.
</p>

<p>
Open a bug and glance through it. Does it have all the necessary info? You'll
often need <path>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</path>, <path>/var/log/Xorg.${DISPLAY}.log</path>,
<c>emerge info</c> and <c>dmesg</c>. First, make sure the user has a proper configuration.
Then, make sure the USE combination is known to work. For example, right now,
combining <c>dmx</c> and <c>doc</c> breaks the build. One of my favorite little
commands is <c>grep -e '^(EE)' -e '^(WW)' Xorg.0.log</c>. If it's a problem with
direct rendering, you'll often want <c>LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo</c> output.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Patches</title>
<section>
<title>Where to Find Them</title>
<body>

<p>
Patches you'll add will come from basically two places:
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">Gentoo's Bugzilla</uri> and
<uri link="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org's Bugzilla</uri>. They
may link to other places from there, but don't feel any pressure to go out
patch-hunting beyond those Bugzillas and the X mailing lists.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>When to Accept Them</title>
<body>

<p>
Patches can only be added after there has been an upstream bug filed and the
patch has been committed upstream. This ensures that the code benefits
from review by the most experienced people in the field and reduces the burden
of support on us, because we can start pointing problems upstream. It also
makes things easier on us in the future, because the next release will have the
patch included so it can be dropped from our patchset.
</p>

<p>
Never accept any requests to add random patches to our ebuilds, regardless of
their source, unless they are also in upstream. If somebody already filed an
upstream bug, follow that bug through until the patch is committed before adding
it to our patchset.
</p>

<p>
The only exceptions to this rule are when the patch fixes a build breakage or a
security vulnerability.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>How to Format Them</title>
<body>

<p>
Try to format patches to apply from the directory one level above
${S}. For example, a libX11-1.0.0 patch would diff from libX11-1.0.0.orig to
libX11-1.0.0, using
<c>diff -urN libX11-1.0.0.orig libX11-1.0.0 > patchname.patch</c>. If you're
creating the patch from upstream source code, it may be easier to apply from
within ${S} instead. Don't waste any effort on remaking that patch, although you
can do this using <c>filterdiff --addprefix</c> from <c>patchutils</c>.
</p>

<p>
Above the content of each patch, add comments on what the patch does and why
it is necessary. Make <b>sure</b> there is an <b>upstream</b> bug filed for
every patch added to the tree, and make sure this URL is listed in the top of
the patch. The only exception is a patch that cannot be used by upstream
because it is for some reason Gentoo-specific.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Maintaining Modular</title>
<section>
<title>Dependencies</title>
<body>

<p>
The modularization of X doesn't allow components of X to safely assume
everything they need will be present at both build- and run-time. Modular
packages' configure.ac is useful for finding out what upstream thinks is
required and is a good guide for what your resulting ebuild should require.
Most of this information is held within the <c>PKG_CHECK_MODULES</c> lines
(note that there are often multiple - look through the whole file).
</p>

<p>
As a general (and somewhat obvious) rule of thumb, <c>x11-proto/*</c> packages
belong in <c>DEPEND</c>, and packages containing fonts, libraries and
executables should go in <c>RDEPEND</c>. See the
<uri link="porting-modular-x-howto.xml">modular X porting guide</uri> for
details.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>More stuff relevant to modular maintenance</title>
<body>

<p>
Definitely have a list of every modular package so you can script actions across
all of modular X. Without this, it can take forever to get anything major done.
Even with it, major cross-tree commits take a ton of time.

Get the list <uri link="modular-x-packages.txt">here</uri>. Remember to update it
with any changes.
</p>
