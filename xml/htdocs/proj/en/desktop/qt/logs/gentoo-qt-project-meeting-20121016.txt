[21:02:03] <yngwin> !herd qt
[21:02:03] <willikins> (qt) hwoarang, johu, kensington, pesa, wired, yngwin
[21:02:04] <pesa> awesome :)
[21:02:07] <yngwin> meeting starting
[21:02:16] <yngwin> agenda at wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Qt/Meeting/2012-10
[21:02:45] <pesa> 3 people only?
[21:03:02] <yngwin> you, me and who?
[21:03:05] <pesa> kensington
[21:03:44] <yngwin> great, the wiki isnt loading for me
[21:04:04] <yngwin> kensington: here?
[21:04:15] -*- kensington here
[21:04:23] <yngwin> ok, lets get started
[21:04:32] <yngwin> does anyone have the agenda page open?
[21:04:37] <pesa> nope :/
[21:04:52] <pesa> it was working 20 minutes ago
[21:05:19] <yngwin> well, iirc the first point was qt5 status
[21:05:31] <pesa> yeah
[21:05:37] <yngwin> any news?
[21:05:55] <kensington> I have it open btw
[21:06:20] <pesa> seems that upstream is going to implement the required changes for parallel installation of qt4 and qt5
[21:06:29] <pesa> which is great news for us
[21:06:29] <yngwin> good
[21:06:41] <pesa> dunno when though
[21:06:55] <pesa> but before 5.0 final otherwise it wouldn't make sense
[21:07:07] <yngwin> yeah i'd guess so
[21:07:30] <pesa> then most probably we won't need an eselect module
[21:07:42] <yngwin> so for now we should probably wait and see how that works out
[21:07:48] <pesa> yep
[21:08:01] <yngwin> how about our missing modules?
[21:08:15] <pesa> qt-webkit is the only major module missing afaik
[21:08:15] <kensington> the page just says qt-webkit
[21:08:26] <yngwin> oh i thought multimedia too
[21:08:48] <kensington> that's in overlay
[21:08:58] <yngwin> :)
[21:09:03] <pesa> needs some love but it's there
[21:09:11] <yngwin> so what seems to be the problem with webkit?
[21:09:27] <pesa> I haven't looked at it yet
[21:09:29] <pesa> :P
[21:09:38] <pesa> it scares me honestly
[21:09:39] <yngwin> i know kensington tried
[21:09:45] -*- kensington ragequit
[21:10:19] <kensington> I ran into one of two errors:
[21:10:21] <yngwin> don't other distros have build scripts for this yet, or do they do monolithic only?
[21:10:58] <kensington> terrible underlinking (my whole system is forced --as-neeed), and/or the build system trying to invoke xcode...
[21:11:36] <pesa> the second one is funny
[21:12:24] <pesa> for the first, I have a strong suspect that qmake produces "underlinked makefiles"
[21:12:43] <yngwin> so this is something we should report upstream
[21:13:03] <pesa> if confirmed, yes
[21:13:10] <kensington> there was a bug opened for one of the underlinking problems I ran into
[21:13:16] <yngwin> ok
[21:13:19] <kensington> but it was dead
[21:13:36] <yngwin> if i had some better hardware i'd be all over qt5 already
[21:14:32] <pesa> kensington: remind me the bug # please
[21:14:59] <yngwin> didnt bonsaikitten do a tinderbox run too?
[21:15:08] <yngwin> he should be able to confirm
[21:15:23] <pesa> yes a while ago
[21:15:48] <pesa> I did a run using flameeyes's tinderbox as well
[21:15:52] <kensington> ah this is what I was thinking of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89312
[21:15:59] <yngwin> so what can we do to bring this forward?
[21:16:36] <pesa> kensington: we already patch that...in qt4
[21:17:10] <kensington> i know
[21:18:40] <pesa> yngwin: I need to dig deeper in qmake code
[21:18:55] <yngwin> alright
[21:19:13] <yngwin> do we need to discuss anything more about qt5?
[21:19:17] <pesa> it's complex code
[21:19:31] <pesa> no
[21:20:05] <yngwin> kensington: what's next on the agenda?
[21:20:18] <kensington> 1.3. Eclasses
[21:20:18] <kensington>     qt5-utils.eclass
[21:20:50] <yngwin> well?
[21:20:58] <pesa> it's still too early imho
[21:21:32] <pesa> especially considering that the changes required for parallel installation might have a big impact on eqmake5()
[21:21:38] <yngwin> yeah i can imagine
[21:21:43] <yngwin> ok, next
[21:22:17] <kensington> 2. qt4-eclass removal
[21:22:17] <kensington>     Last ebuild is media-video/vlc-1.1.13, see security stabilisation in progress in bug #408881
[21:22:17] <kensington>     Deprecation procedure see devmanual
[21:22:18] <willikins> kensington: https://bugs.gentoo.org/408881 "<media-video/vlc-2.0.1 : Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-{1775,1776})"; Gentoo Security, Vulnerabilities; IN_P; ago:security
[21:22:25] <kensington> I think vlc is pruned now
[21:22:36] <pesa> yes
[21:23:05] <yngwin> yes, i think we can remove the eclass now
[21:23:57] <kensington> great
[21:24:12] <yngwin> hm, i thought i sent an email about that
[21:24:13] <kensington> that closes bug #311481 too
[21:24:15] <willikins> kensington: https://bugs.gentoo.org/311481 "[tracker] Migrate ebuilds from qt4.eclass to qt4-r2.eclass usage"; Gentoo Linux, Ebuilds; IN_P; yngwin:qt
[21:24:34] <yngwin> yes, sept 13
[21:24:40] <pesa> yes close it please
[21:24:55] <pesa> yngwin: uhm more than 30 days?
[21:24:56] <pesa> ago
[21:24:59] <yngwin> yes
[21:25:13] <kensington> let's nuke it :)
[21:25:14] <yngwin> i can remove it after the meeting
[21:25:22] <pesa> awesome
[21:25:34] <yngwin> :)
[21:25:44] <yngwin> ok, next?
[21:25:45] <kensington> 3. qt4-r2.eclass updates
[21:25:45] <kensington>     TODO yngwin: translation handling move to l10n.eclass
[21:25:53] <yngwin> yeah thats still todo
[21:26:05] <kensington> 4. Razor-qt status update
[21:26:05] <kensington>     live ebuilds, keywords file, set
[21:26:05] <kensington>     0.5 release
[21:26:05] <kensington>     QtDesktop apps
[21:26:21] <yngwin> i just committed the split ebuilds for 0.5.0 yesterday
[21:26:26] <pesa> oh congrats on this one yngwin
[21:26:40] <yngwin> i still need to backport some changes from cvs to overlay
[21:27:09] <yngwin> but yeah, i'm pleased with the progress
[21:27:19] <pesa> yeah good job
[21:27:27] <kensington> ++
[21:27:30] <yngwin> we even got a git pull request for some improvements to ebuilds from upstream
[21:27:36] <kensington> cool
[21:27:49] <pesa> awesome upstream is awesome
[21:27:54] <yngwin> indeed :)
[21:28:24] <yngwin> just like qpdfview, he also keeps me informed
[21:28:48] <pesa> yep :)
[21:28:49] <yngwin> i posted a screenshot of razorqt 0.5.0 in #-qt the other day
[21:29:16] <yngwin> so now the wiki page needs updating
[21:29:29] -*- kensington checks backlog
[21:29:38] <kensington> that's pretty nifty
[21:29:39] <yngwin> i mean about razorqt
[21:30:03] <yngwin> anyway, i think we now have a nice light-weight Qt alternative DE
[21:30:57] <yngwin> about apps, i still need to try out qconnman
[21:31:08] <yngwin> dont know if anyone else has
[21:31:24] <pesa> nope
[21:31:27] -*- kensington puts kde hat on
[21:31:29] <kensington> nope :P
[21:31:42] <pesa> I'm satisfied with NM nowadays
[21:32:42] <pesa> I hated it until 1-2 years ago
[21:33:17] <yngwin> yeah its not bad
[21:33:55] <yngwin> anyway, if someone has more qt apps to recommend, i'd like to hear it :)
[21:34:27] <yngwin> i get something from the wiki now, finally
[21:34:41] <yngwin> lets move on to 5. Open bugs 
[21:35:08] <pesa> http://gitorious.org/qconnman/qconnman development seems stalled
[21:35:44] <yngwin> yeah its not very active
[21:35:51] <pesa> ok bug 436678
[21:35:53] <willikins> pesa: https://bugs.gentoo.org/436678 "x11-libs/qt-webkit-4.8.3: QA Notice: USE Flag 'c++0x' not in IUSE for x11-libs/qt-webkit-4.8.3"; Gentoo Linux, Ebuilds; UNCO; mirraz1:qt
[21:35:57] <pesa> wtf?
[21:37:02] <yngwin>  49 if version_is_at_least 4.8; then
[21:37:02] <yngwin>  50     [[ ${CATEGORY}/${PN} != x11-libs/qt-webkit ]] && IUSE+=" c++0x"
[21:37:02] <yngwin>  51     version_is_at_least 4.8.3 || IUSE+=" qpa"
[21:37:02] <yngwin>  52 fi
[21:37:02] <kensington> no build log, no emerge --info -> NEEDINFO
[21:37:14] <yngwin> isnt that the culprit?
[21:37:34] <pesa> that was intended
[21:38:02] <pesa> the QA warning comes from a "use c++0x" call somewhere
[21:39:00] <yngwin> yeah
[21:39:06] <yngwin> i cant see where it comes from either
[21:39:33] <pesa> let me try again
[21:39:56] <yngwin> maybe something that depends on qt-webkit[c++0x=]
[21:40:51] <pesa> I don't think so
[21:41:07] <pesa> can't reproduce anyway
[21:41:12] <pesa> I never could
[21:41:15] <yngwin> NEEDINFO
[21:41:48] <yngwin> next?
[21:42:25] <kensington> bug #434780
[21:42:26] <willikins> kensington: https://bugs.gentoo.org/434780 "x11-libs/qt-core-4.8.2: CXXFLAGS not respected when bootstrapping qmake"; Gentoo Linux, Eclasses and Profiles; CONF; pesa:qt
[21:43:00] <kensington> iirc pesa was going to check if that was with reason or not
[21:43:07] <pesa> yeah still todo
[21:43:11] <pesa> have to ask upstream
[21:43:24] <pesa> actually I did on irc but got no answer
[21:43:41] <pesa> I'll retry
[21:43:56] <yngwin> great
[21:44:15] <yngwin> bug #428256 dev-libs/qjson-0.7.1-r1 problem with QStringList serialization
[21:44:16] <willikins> yngwin: https://bugs.gentoo.org/428256 "dev-libs/qjson-0.7.1-r1 problem with QStringList serialization"; Gentoo Linux, Library; CONF; zordon13:qt
[21:44:32] <yngwin> IN PROGRESS pesa: ask upstream to release, or package snapshot 
[21:44:41] <pesa> I asked but again, no reaply
[21:44:46] <pesa> reply*
[21:44:49] <pesa> lol
[21:44:53] <yngwin> so let's package a snapshot then
[21:45:03] <pesa> upstreams hate me
[21:45:15] <yngwin> heh
[21:46:22] <yngwin> who wants to tackle the snapshot?
[21:46:49] <pesa> I can do it but will have low priority
[21:47:19] <pesa> !rdep qjson
[21:47:22] <willikins> pesa: Too many packages have reverse RDEPEND on dev-libs/qjson, go to http://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/genrdeps/rindex/dev-libs/qjson instead.
[21:48:02] <kensington> if you are busy, I can do it
[21:48:30] <pesa> yeah feel free to do it
[21:48:36] <yngwin> ok \
[21:49:46] <pesa> bug 431462
[21:49:48] <willikins> pesa: https://bugs.gentoo.org/431462 "[qt overlay] dev-db/unixODBC-GUI-Qt-9999 fails to build"; Gentoo Linux, Ebuilds; CONF; patrick:qt
[21:50:08] <kensington> I had a look at that a while back actually
[21:50:52] <kensington> iirc the problem was some bundled autogen files
[21:50:53] <yngwin> underlinking?
[21:51:15] <kensington> strangely enough, removing them and building fixed it...but only outside of portage
[21:51:20] <pesa_> crap
[21:51:32] <-> pesa_ is now known as pesa
[21:51:49] <pesa> what did you say?
[21:52:01] <yngwin> <kensington> I had a look at that a while back actually
[21:52:01] <yngwin> <kensington> iirc the problem was some bundled autogen files
[21:52:01] <yngwin> <yngwin> underlinking?
[21:52:01] <yngwin> <kensington> strangely enough, removing them and building fixed it...but only outside of portage
[21:52:18] <kensington> this is what ubuntu does to fix it: https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/precise/unixodbc-gui-qt/precise/revision/5
[21:52:36] <pesa> oh it's upstream that sucks then
[21:52:47] <kensington> but as I said, it worked fine outside of portage, but I could not make it work in
[21:53:16] <kensington> which doesn't really make any sense
[21:53:24] <pesa> indeed
[21:53:36] <pesa> oh they bundle the moc-generated files!
[21:53:46] <pesa> that really sucks
[21:55:04] <pesa> I don't know... if nobody cares/uses the live ebuild I think it should be pruned
[21:55:29] <pesa> this breakage has gone unnoticed for months
[21:55:47] <kensington> I tend to agree (although I note it seems to be widely packaged by others)
[21:56:00] <pesa> and was not discovered by a user actually using the live ebuild, but by a tinderbox run
[21:56:05] <yngwin> well, it should be fixable
[21:56:16] <pesa> yes but it will break next time
[21:56:24] <yngwin> but yeah i cant say i'd miss it
[21:56:26] <pesa> we're just wasting our time
[21:56:46] <kensington> let's nuke it then
[21:57:08] <pesa> kensington: do others package it from the scm repo?
[21:57:50] <kensington> pesa: looks all to be snapshots
[21:58:45] <pesa> mmm no stable release
[22:00:26] <pesa> do as you wish
[22:01:06] <yngwin> is anyone using this?
[22:02:01] <pesa> I bet no
[22:04:21] <yngwin> well, i'd say let's prune it then
[22:04:42] <yngwin> anything else?
[22:06:12] <pesa> yes
[22:06:27] <pesa> anyone with gcc 4.7?
[22:06:36] <pesa> there's bug 426458
[22:06:37] <willikins> https://bugs.gentoo.org/426458 "net-libs/qmf-2.0_p201209: fails to build with gcc 4.7"; Gentoo Linux, Ebuilds; CONF; flameeyes:pesa
[22:07:12] <pesa> should be easy but I don't have gcc 4.7
[22:07:21] <kensington> I do, I'll have a look ten
[22:07:26] <kensington> s/ten/then/
[22:07:32] <pesa> thanks a lot
[22:07:59] <yngwin> i dont have 4.7 yet
[22:10:31] <yngwin> more?
[22:10:38] <kensington> bug #271866
[22:10:39] <willikins> kensington: https://bugs.gentoo.org/271866 "x11-libs/qt-webkit XML nested A infinite loop (CVE-2009-1233)"; Gentoo Security, Vulnerabilities; CONF; rbu:security
[22:11:33] <kensington> I haven't been able to find much info about that CVE upstream either way
[22:12:24] <yngwin> well, can you test it?
[22:13:06] <kensington> no problem with konqueror, but that's not exactly a conclusive "fixed"
[22:13:49] <pesa> it says "a socket error has occured"
[22:14:05] <yngwin> seems fixed
[22:14:27] <pesa> I mean the python script
[22:15:06] <kensington> ok I take it back
[22:15:09] <kensington> konq just crashed
[22:15:55] <yngwin> so, let's ask upstream then
[22:16:30] <yngwin> kensington: you want to do that?
[22:16:48] <kensington> sure
[22:16:53] <yngwin> good :)
[22:17:13] <pesa> I tried with rekonq
[22:17:26] <pesa> This page contains the following errors:
[22:17:28] <pesa> error on line 1 at column 15024: Excessive node nesting.
[22:17:45] <yngwin> that sounds promising
[22:17:53] <pesa> yep, it does not crash
[22:18:21] <pesa> kensington: are you sure you're using webkit and not KHTML?
[22:19:07] <pesa> (same with qupzilla btw)
[22:19:47] <kensington> pesa: you are right, I am not
[22:19:49] <pesa> both qupzilla and rekonq use qt-webkit as their engine
[22:20:07] <pesa> ok so we know that KHTML is vulnerable
[22:20:24] <yngwin> well thats not this bug
[22:20:34] <pesa> right
[22:20:35] <yngwin> it seems qt-webkit isnt anymore
[22:21:54] <kensington> give security the go-ahead then?
[22:21:57] <yngwin> someone who wants to add that info to the bug?
[22:22:13] <kensington> will o
[22:22:18] <yngwin> :)
[22:22:23] <yngwin> ok, anything else?
[22:23:10] <yngwin> if not, then i'd like to wrap up
[22:23:48] <pesa> sure
[22:24:04] <yngwin> ok, thanks guys
[22:24:09] <yngwin> see you around
[22:24:46] <pesa> thank you
[22:24:48] <pesa> ;)
