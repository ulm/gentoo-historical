[22:06:22] <wired> lets start
[22:06:39] <wired> rollcall, who's here?
[22:06:40] <wired> !herd qt
[22:06:43] <willikins> (qt) abcd, ayoy, chiiph, spatz, tampakrap, wired
[22:07:00] * ayoy *
[22:07:02] * ABCD is here
[22:07:08] <chiiph> here
[22:07:52] <wired> main reason we are here: lead elections
[22:09:33] <wired> I'm willing to do this for another year, so I'll nominate myself :)
[22:09:46] <ayoy> ufff :)
[22:11:16] <wired> there were no other nominations, is there anyone else who would be interested?
[22:11:40] <chiiph> I'm fine with you still being up there :)
[22:11:45] <ayoy> +1
[22:12:40] <wired> thanks :)
[22:13:21] <wired> ABCD: how about you?
[22:13:38] <ABCD> you can have *that* job :)
[22:14:07] <wired> heh
[22:14:21] <wired> ok, that settles it then
[22:14:46] <wired> for the record, no other nominations, 4/6 ok with me staying in lead
[22:16:25] <ayoy> \o/
[22:17:08] <wired> Qt quite a few bugs assigned to it, but most are not critical
[22:17:16] <wired> would anyone want to discuss any specific bug?
[22:18:13] <wired> my time until recently was extremelly limited so I don't remember them all, but that will change before our next meeting :)
[22:18:54] <ayoy> there was this glibc-2.13
[22:19:01] <ayoy> which sounded bad
[22:19:11] <ayoy> but iirc noone could reproduce it, right? :)
[22:19:26] <ayoy> bug #354109
[22:19:29] <willikins> ayoy: https://bugs.gentoo.org/354109 "sys-libs/glibc-2.13 breaks all Qt apps"; Gentoo Linux, Core system; CONF; gorthauer87:qt
[22:20:04] <wired> it works fine here
[22:20:11] <ayoy> yeah, same here
[22:20:13] <chiiph> yep, here too
[22:20:55] <wired> id like to see bug 372719 fixed
[22:20:57] <willikins> wired: https://bugs.gentoo.org/372719 "qt4{,-r2}.eclass: eqmake4 is overly strict when parsing CONFIG variable"; Gentoo Linux, Eclasses and Profiles; CONF; maxposedon:qt
[22:21:57] <ayoy> yeah, sure
[22:22:18] <wired> also, if possible, I'd like everyone (me included :p) to try and fix a few bugs before the next meeting
[22:22:44] <wired> we've been a bit dormant lately as a team :)
[22:22:52] <ayoy> that's right..
[22:23:05] <ayoy> the bug list needs some general grooming I'd say
[22:23:12] <ayoy> bug 294694
[22:23:15] <wired> yeah
[22:23:15] <willikins> ayoy: https://bugs.gentoo.org/294694 "x11-libs/qt-core-4.5.3-r2 does not compile"; Gentoo Linux, KDE; CONF; wumba:qt
[22:23:19] <ayoy> 4.5.3 :D
[22:23:33] <wired> heh
[22:23:44] <wired> on a happier note, i finally opened the dev bug for pesa :)
[22:23:58] <wired> bug 374103
[22:24:01] <willikins> https://bugs.gentoo.org/374103 "New Developer: Davide Pesavento (pesa)"; Gentoo Developers/Staff, New Developers; CONF; wired:recruiters
[22:24:11] <ayoy> yeah I've seen that
[22:24:12] <ayoy> great!
[22:25:14] <wired> ;)
[22:25:36] <wired> so, thanks for being here on such sort notice, I don't want to keep you any longer
[22:26:03] <ayoy> yeah, thanks for the meetup
[22:26:15] <ayoy> any plans for the next meeting?
[22:26:30] <ayoy> so that we could set some deadline/milestone for ourselves
[22:26:43] <ayoy> that said, I'm going to be off in July ;]
[22:26:51] <wired> how about the 28th of July?
[22:26:52] <wired> lol
[22:27:07] <wired> scratch that then
[22:27:17] <ayoy> :)
[22:27:26] <wired> either the 14th or 21th of August then
[22:27:28] <ayoy> yeah, I'm on vacations starting 13th
[22:27:47] <ayoy> 14th Aug seems fine
[22:28:02] <ayoy> we can think of either of these two dates
[22:28:09] <wired> great
[22:28:09] <ayoy> and check later which is better for everyone
[22:28:18] <wired> we'll coordinate in the alias
[22:28:22] <ayoy> yup
[22:28:42] <wired> here's to having 30% of the bugs closed by then ;)
