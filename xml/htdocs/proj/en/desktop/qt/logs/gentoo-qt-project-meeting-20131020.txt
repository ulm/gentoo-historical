<Pinkbyte> !herd qt
<willikins> Pinkbyte: (qt) kensington, pesa, pinkbyte, wired, yngwin, zlogene
<Pinkbyte> So, who is there? :-)
* kensington waves
<yngwin> present
* pesa here
* johu is here as well
<Pinkbyte> Good. So, let's begin then
<Pinkbyte> pesa, i see you changed inclusion target for Qt 5.x to 5.2? Can you explain this?
<pesa> sure
<pesa> 5.2 is due before the end of the year, and it's the version kde frameworks 5 is targeting
<pesa> investing more time in 5.1 seems like a waste of time to me
<kensington> are some of the blocking issues expected to be fixed upstream in 5.2, or do we still need to worry about them?
<pesa> by the time 5.1 could be ready for inclusion, 5.2 will be out (or almost)
<Pinkbyte> sounds reasonable
<pesa> 5.2 has some improvements to the configure script, and drops qtjsbackend
<pesa> other than that I think the issues are still present
<yngwin> ok, when can we expect a beta?
<pesa> end of october IIRC
<yngwin> ah, soon
<pesa> tomorrow actually
<pesa> according to http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-5.2-release
<yngwin> lets work on that then, and see if we can those ebuilds ready, so we're on track when 5.2 final gets released
<pesa> agreed
<Pinkbyte> i see lot of request(both from users and developers) about inclusion of Qt 5 in main tree.
<yngwin> yeah they are increasing
<kensington> ebuilds do not currently meet qa standards
<pesa> I undersand, but including it now would be more of a pain than a gain
<Pinkbyte> so, in the times when qt5 is pending for inclusion, should we add still masked qt5 USE-flag to packages who can built with it?
<yngwin> so what needs to be done to get them up to standards?
<kensington> bugs such as linking to existing libraries is a serious blocker
<pesa> ^ yep
<Pinkbyte> i mean, do this usual practice, even before inclusion itself
<johu> the missing packages is a huge blocker for me...
<kensington> there are already existing packages with qt5 USE flag in the tree
<kensington> johu: having packages in the tree is no good if they don't work
<pesa> if the flag is masked, I dont see a problem
<johu> kensington: yes i know
<yngwin> it is
<Pinkbyte> well, it should be carefully testing in cases when both Qt 5 and Qt 4 installed
<pesa> johu: can't you depend on ebuilds from another overlay?
<Pinkbyte> cause i saw some nasty bugs, related to this context
<okias> ready, sorry for late :)
<johu> but linguist/tools are mandatory before tree inclusion
<pesa> hey okias
<okias> Hello guys :)
<johu> pesa: we are already adding qt5 deps yes
<kensington> yeah, and for packages that are compatible for both, having support is needed before qt5 enters the tree, to prevent automagics
<Pinkbyte> pesa, johu, if we are talking about main tree, it is not good to depend on some overlay :-). If we are talking about kde overlay - i see no problem here.
<pesa> johu: oh are you talking about missing ebuilds in the overlay then? ok I'll try to package the missing ones
<kensington> Pinkbyte: that is why the flag is masked
<Pinkbyte> kensington, yep
<johu> pesa, Pinkbyte: yes correct
<pesa> Pinkbyte: talkinga about kde overlay I guess
<yngwin> i would suggest to get 5.2_rc ebuilds into the official tree, but hardmasked, so package maintainers can test
<Pinkbyte> yngwin, i vote for this!
<okias> yngwin: +1
<pesa> let's see what the status is in a month from now
<Pinkbyte> we can talk to flameeyes to do a tinderbox run for it :-)
<yngwin> i will try to make some time in the next few weeks to do some testing etc
<pesa> thanks
<yngwin> now that i have a new dev box :)
<kensington> I agree with pesa, we need to be careful putting it in the tree even masked
<pesa> yngwin: awesome
<okias> anyway, what about packages which going check "if qt5 use qt5, else qt4", with --enable-qt? 
<yngwin> lets make sure we have bugs that block the tracker for all issues
<johu> +1
<kensington> okias: I think we previously decided packages that support both should have qt4 and qt5 USE flag with REQUIRED_USE to enforce one being selected
<pesa> okias: we need separate qt4 and qt5 useflags
<okias> kensington: pesa: for example https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488640
<Pinkbyte> pesa, not only separate flags - we should patch buildsystem to explicitly link with selected Qt implementation
<okias> I totally agree about qt4 qt5 flags, but it wont compile for qt4, if it going to found qt5 libs
<kensington> Pinkbyte: that's a given
<Pinkbyte> e.g if we have USE="qt4 -qt5" and installed Qt 5
<pesa> indeed
<johu> okias: !dev-qt/qtgui:5 what a pain for users
<pesa> so far I've seen *tons* of upstream failures
<pesa> in configure and friends
<Pinkbyte> so, lot's of testing needed
<kensington> Pinkbyte: most upstreams that support both of course provide a configure option
<yngwin> yeah some build systems may need patching
<pesa> they do a mess using some tools from qt4 and some tools from qt5
<okias> johu: yes, that's terrible
<okias> johu: but, I didn't found better solution
<okias> except patching configure.ac
<yngwin> patching is the obvious answer
<pesa> fix the damn configure
<pesa> it's horribly broken anyway
<pesa> how can they blindly use /usr/bin/moc regardless of the version?
<yngwin> anyway, are there any specific issues we should tackle asap?
<okias> vlc and wireshark use same schmatics as I noticed
<pesa> they should query qmake or use cmake and get the proper paths to the various tools
<yngwin> i'm thinking qtwebkit standalone ebuild
<kensington> yngwin: the big one is bug #451456
<willikins> kensington: https://bugs.gentoo.org/451456 "[qt overlay] Qt5 packages (dev-qt/qt*:5) try to link against already installed versions during recompilation"; Gentoo Linux, Library; CONF; eugene.shalygin:qt
<yngwin> yes
<pesa> kensington: yep
<pesa> does anyone know how to reliably reproduce it?
<xhochy_> pesa: webkit widgets use flag
<pesa> a way that doesnt involve qtwebkit
<pesa> :)
<xhochy_> hehe
<okias> well, not sure, maybe
<pesa> or my laptop will die soon
<okias> because I recompiled qt 5.1.1 and had installed 5.1.0, and now qtwebkit (last package) fail with some weird linking 
<kensington> when upgrading to a version with an ABI break possibl
<okias> which is maybe caused by miscompiled some part qtlibs
<Pinkbyte> pesa, what's about moving qt binaries in apropriate folders(both for qt4 and qt5)? Some progress?
<pesa> Pinkbyte: nope
<pesa> kensington: err can you give me an example?
<kensington> isn't qt5 stuff already in its odnw dir?
<pesa> kensington: yes it is, qt4 is not though
<kensington> pesa: I don't have anything specific, just trying to remember
<kensington> I saw a good feature request about putting symlinks (eg. qmake5) in $PATH
<pesa> kensington: public ABI is never broken during qt5 lifecycle, so it must be some private lib ABI
<kensington> pesa: ah, that would make more sense
<pesa> kensington: upstream feature request?
<kensington> pesa: nah, a gentoo user
<pesa> mmm
<kensington> might make sense upstream (but they don't care about slotting?)
<pesa> we shall have a look at what other distros do
<yngwin> is there any distro already shipping qt5?
<xhochy_> debian-based stuff uses qtchooser for that
<pesa> ah good question!
<kensington> xhochy_: is that like eselect?
<xhochy_> kensington: yeah
<pesa> xhochy_: yeah thats a given, we'll use it too
<xhochy_> sadly it breaks a lot :(
<pesa> oh does it?
<xhochy_> esp. for qt4only project if you have qt5 selected
<pesa> ah I see
<xhochy_> something like "Invalid Qt4 version: 5.0.1" is a common problem with users trying to compile stuff
<pesa> can we force qt4 as default initially?
<pesa> i.e. until packages are fixed
<kensington> I don't think eselect should affect ebuilds at all
<kensington> pesa: sane build systems will not detect qt5 by default
<pesa> kensington: agreed, sadly some packages use hardcoded paths
<xhochy_> The default Qt4-CMakeModule fails with the above message when using qt5 in qtchooser
<pesa> and I'm not sure if upstreams are supporting qtchooser (i.e. running qmake -qt5 for instance)
<kensington> I haven't heard/seen any issues about qt5 being used for a qt4 package so far, but I am sure a tinderbox run will uncover something
<okias> anyway, vlc and wireshark look like OK with qt5.1.1. Just broken logic in configure
<kensington> xhochy_: ebuilds will be built using USE flags, not any eselected qt version
<yngwin> apparently Arch already ships qt5: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=qt5&maintainer=&flagged=
<pesa> xhochy_: ok, what if we *force* qtchooser to use qt4 by default?
<xhochy_> pesa: that should work, but I suspect a lot of packages failing when switched to qt5 in qtchoose
<pesa> ok, thats not a problem from our POV
<pesa> not for now at least
<xhochy_> hehe :)
<pesa> let me explain
<pesa> we introduce qtchooser defaulting to qt4 and it cannot be switched by users to qt5
<pesa> existing qt4 packages will/should continue to work
<pesa> we gradually fix packages supporting qt5
<pesa> then we unmask qt5 use flag
<pesa> finally we can re-enable user-switching of qt versions thru qtchooser
<pesa> sounds good?
<johu> unmasking of the use flag can only be done after stabilization, just for the record
<pesa> good point
<kensington> can't we stable mask it?
<yngwin> we can
<pesa> we can use use.stable.mask or whatever
<xhochy_> pesa: but we need fix some qt4only packages too, as a lot depend on using just moc in the PATH
<yngwin> btw, arch takes the easy way out (for now): qt5 conflicts with qt, so you cant install them both at the same time
<kensington> xhochy_: are there particular packages you ran into this problem with so far?
<pesa> yngwin: :|
<pesa> xhochy_: tinderbox will help
<pesa> xhochy_: and those issues must be fixed only before the last step anyway
<pesa> i.e. they dont block qt5 addition to the tree
<xhochy_> http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/qt5-default <-- ubuntu ships both using qtchooser
<xhochy_> kensington: havn't seen the problem yet on Gentoo, but you should be able to reprocue it using any CMake-based Qt project: Switch in the project to Qt4 but let qt-chooser point to qt5
<kensington> xhochy_: that situation will not affect gentoo, for cmake we will pass the appropriate flag and qtchooser will have no effect on the ebuild
<xhochy_> kensington: it will have, as Qt4-CMake uses moc from the path
<kensington> oh hm
<Pinkbyte> ok, so to conclude - what's our next steps? Will we move Qt4 binaries in separate folder(and if yes - how?)?
<pesa> right
<pesa> Pinkbyte: yes we have to
<pesa> for now I think a qtchooser hardcoded to use qt4 should work fine
<pesa> anyone sees any issues with that?
<pesa> xhochy_: I guess we need to patch qt4 cmake macros then
<Pinkbyte> for saving backward compatibility it's the best option for now
<pesa> yes
<pesa> if anyone has better ideas please speak up
<pesa> this migration wont be easy
<pesa> ok let's move on 
<okias> ok with it. May I start about lrelease? and qt5-utils?
<pesa> implementation details ;) let's talk later about those please
<okias> okey
<Pinkbyte> So, have we done with 1 paragraph of agenda?
<Pinkbyte> or anybody has something to add?
<yngwin> it would be helpful if we keep details on the wiki page, so we all know what the plans are, and what we can do to help out
<Pinkbyte> Ok. Let's move on, guys.
<pesa> absolutely
<Pinkbyte> pesa, so, would not you mind to create a draft? :-)
<Pinkbyte> as you are most informed person amongst us
<pesa> hehe sure
<Pinkbyte> Ok then. What's about Qt 4.8.5 stabilization?
<pesa> do it?
<pesa> rename c++0x to c++11 ?
<johu> its just a renaming?
<Pinkbyte> pesa, yep, it should be done first, IMO
<kensington> ++
<pesa> (before stabilization so people wont complain about rebuild if they use -N)
<Pinkbyte> johu, yep, there is no more c++0x, but final standart is c++11
<yngwin> indeed
<pesa> johu: yes
<johu> or does it implies breakage
<johu> ok thanks
<pesa> it implies checking revdeps
<johu> then do it 
<pesa> and adapting USE deps
<yngwin> ok, so is there a bug for that?
<yngwin> i think i saw one
<pesa> FTR I used c++0x as USE flag name because that's what upstream uses in qt4
<johu> yngwin: yes its referenced in the stable bug
<kensington> bug #488160
<willikins> kensington: https://bugs.gentoo.org/488160 "dev-qt/*: please replace USE=c++0x with USE=c++11"; Gentoo Linux, Library; CONF; mgorny:qt
<yngwin> good
<johu> when do you think to be ready with this task?
<pesa> few days
<pesa> maybe even today
<yngwin> do we have any revdeps referencing that useflag?
<johu> sounds wonderfull
<pesa> yngwin: dunno, just grep the thing
<yngwin> sure
<kensington> that's interesting, I don't see any packages with the new flag
<yngwin> ah, the other suggestion was if we could just drop the useflag
<pesa> qt5 :)
<pesa> yngwin: and do what?
<pesa> always enable?
<yngwin> detect if the active gcc supports it, and then enable it?
<pesa> mmm
<pesa> can you leave a comment in the bug about this please?
<yngwin> can you think of any reason not to enable it?
<pesa> I need to check something in the configure script
<yngwin> ok
<pesa> main issue is that taking control away from users has always resulted in someone complaining
<yngwin> done
<pesa> advanced users usually
<Pinkbyte> and we have bug #410325
<pesa> ah
<willikins> Pinkbyte: https://bugs.gentoo.org/410325 "=dev-qt/qtgui-4.8.1[c++0x] fails to build on arm"; Gentoo Linux, Library; UNCO; dpolukarov:qt
<Pinkbyte> which i am checking just right now
<pesa> Pinkbyte: thanks
<pesa> I'm thinking that advanced users could always disable c++11 via their CXXFLAGS
<pesa> and gcc 4.6 which has good enough c++11 support is stable everywhere afaics
<pesa> everywhere except sparc
<pesa> ok lets proceed with the agenda
<Pinkbyte> pesa, qmake-utils. What's about it?
<pesa> we should send the new eclass for review
<pesa> and finally commit it
<kensington> ++
<Pinkbyte> true. I think about 2 messages - one with qmake-utils itself and second(later) with some resolution for bug #479744)
<willikins> Pinkbyte: https://bugs.gentoo.org/479744 "qt4-r2.eclass: split into qmake-utils.eclass"; Gentoo Linux, Eclasses and Profiles; IN_P; hasufell:qt
<pesa> what do you mean?
<Pinkbyte> pesa, i mean - first we introduce qmake-utils to tree
<Pinkbyte> and second - splitting eqmake4 from qt4-r2 into it
<pesa> I'm confused, qmake-utils already has eqmake4
<kensington> I think he means about changing qt4-r2 to use the new qmake-utils
<pesa> oh like inheriting it
<Pinkbyte> yep, sorry for confusion
<pesa> mmm yes sure why not
<kensington> it should be a trivial change in any case
<pesa> the only issue I see with that is that eqmake5 will be exposed to qt4-r2 consumers
<Pinkbyte> pesa, i think that this is minor issue
<pesa> yeah
<kensington> if anyone uses that we can ridicule them :p
<pesa> :D
<pesa> who wants to do this? (posting RFC to ML)
* pesa hides
<Pinkbyte> pesa, it's a cheating!
<Pinkbyte> :-)
<Pinkbyte> I can do this. Eclasses should be taken from our overlay, right?
<pesa> correct
<pesa> thanks
<Pinkbyte> Ok. Our past TODO's
<Pinkbyte> i have beaten goldendict(at last!), so - YAHOO! :-)
<kensington> ++
<pesa> w00t
<Pinkbyte> anybody tried to poke qutim - bug #464690 ?
<willikins> Pinkbyte: https://bugs.gentoo.org/464690 "=net-im/qutim-0.3.1 fails to connect"; Gentoo Linux, Applications; CONF; ago:qt
<pesa> nope
<yngwin> apparently not
<Pinkbyte> that's sad
<kensington> I didn't see much activity upstream
<pesa> as I probably already said, I'm focusing on qt (4 & 5) and very few other selected packages, so don't count on me for fixing bugs in "minor" packages (minor for me at least)
<pesa> and we have tons of other bugs, why are we focusing on qutim specifically?
<Pinkbyte> dunno, i do not remember who was added this to agenda
<Pinkbyte> maybe i will look it once more time.
<kensington> no reason, it was added to the agenda a long time ago, and just keeps getting carried forwward
<pesa> exactly
<kensington> since no action was taken
<Pinkbyte> yngwin, how's going migration of wiki pages?
<Pinkbyte> should we remove it(i mean, qutim bug) from next agenda?
<pesa> I think so
<pesa> it's "just" a bug like many others in our bugzilla
<yngwin> Pinkbyte: not
<pesa> and needs to be fixed obviously, but no need to discuss about it
<yngwin> as in: i have so many other things to do, and this is near the bottom of my list
<kensington> what items are still pendign?
<yngwin> kensington: asking me?
* pesa afk for a few minutes, sorry
<kensington> yngwin: yeah
<yngwin> old meeting summaries
<Pinkbyte> paragraph 5 - qtphonon/phonon thingie
<kensington> oh, from gitorious
<yngwin> yup
<Pinkbyte> i have stuck with resolving it :-(
<yngwin> anything specific?
<Pinkbyte> just dunno how to resolve bug #475786
<willikins> Pinkbyte: https://bugs.gentoo.org/475786 "dev-python/pyside detects dev-qt/qtphonon but not media-libs/phonon"; Gentoo Linux, Development; CONF; sherpya:qt
<yngwin> upstream?
<Pinkbyte> yngwin, honesly - dunno.
<xhochy_> did you test with latest head? phonon changed lately a lot of his cmake stuff
<xhochy_> phonon-head :)
<Pinkbyte> xhochy_, yes, but troble is in pyside's buildsystem
<yngwin> so what do you want to do? lets not drag this out
<Pinkbyte> yngwin, dunno. I have tried with no luck. Somebody should go deeper
<Pinkbyte> pesa, are you back?
<yngwin> at this point i dont think pyside is worth that much trouble
<yngwin> lets get qt5 in tree
<yngwin> this issue should probably be referred upstream, or see what other distros do
<Pinkbyte> Ok.  Is there something that we should additionally discuss?
<yngwin> i just want to repeat what i said on ML, that i will soon look into making lxde-qt git ebuilds to replace the razor-qt ones
<yngwin> i'm not sure if anyone else is interested in that
<yngwin> i guess i should take this to the lxde team
<kensington> yngwin: I saw that, it looks very interesting
<Pinkbyte> yngwin, it's good, but i am personally not interested in lxde, sorry.
<yngwin> is anyone interested in keeping this under qt co-maintainership?
<Pinkbyte> But i had plans for trying razor-qt, so maybe i will try merged version
<pesa> back
<kensington> yngwin: it makes sense
<Pinkbyte> pesa, phonon problem. I have tried to resolve it and failed :-(
<pesa> uhm
<pesa> I can look into pyside
<pesa> but it's low priority atm
<pesa> qt5 is more important
<Pinkbyte> sure
<pesa> phonon can stay like it is now, deprecating qtphonon is a "nice to have" imho, but should not drain manpower from other more important tasks
<okias> that's spirit :/ https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488640
<Pinkbyte> pesa, have something to discuss additionally?
<Pinkbyte> okias, Jeroen does a vast amount of work for wireshark - it's his choice
<kensington> it's also a typical response for him
<pesa> Pinkbyte: I believe not
<Pinkbyte> okias, your resolution is not correct and he is not interested in doing it proper now, so - WONTFIX
<yngwin> reopen when qt5 is in tree
<pesa> yep
<Pinkbyte> Thank you guys, meeting is over.
<pesa> thank you all
<yngwin> feel free to submit a wireshark ebuild with qt5 support to the qt overlay
