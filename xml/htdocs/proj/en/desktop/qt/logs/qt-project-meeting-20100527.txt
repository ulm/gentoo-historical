[21:35:22] <wired> spatz: thanks - for the nomination as well :)
[21:35:37] <wired> before you all go, did anyone make any progress with qt-svg?
[21:36:57] <spatz> what's wrong with it?
[21:37:47] <wired> big 301476
[21:37:51] <wired> ...
[21:37:52] <wired> bug 301476
[21:37:55] <willikins> wired: https://bugs.gentoo.org/301476 "QSvgWidget produce segfaults : x11-libs/qt-svg"; Gentoo Linux, Library; ASSI; antonmx@gmail.com:qt@g.o
[21:41:39] <wired> spatz: any ideas?
[21:43:12] *** Joins: ayoy (~ayoy@gentoo/developer/ayoy)
[21:44:07] *** Joins: [Enrico] (~chiccoroc@gentoo/contributor/Enrico)
[21:44:41] <spatz> crashes for me too :/
[21:44:49] <wired> yes
[21:45:04] <ayoy> oh hey
[21:45:11] <spatz> I wonder how come everything works
[21:45:12] <ayoy> sorry guys, I forgot :*
[21:45:12] <wired> spatz: I actually tried merging qt-gui and qt-svg and it works
[21:45:15] <ayoy> *:(
[21:45:20] <wired> ayoy: welcome :P
[21:45:34] <spatz> maybe there's some error/warning during qt-svg compilation that we're missing?
[21:46:36] <wired> perhaps
[21:47:18] <wired> spatz: im worried that kde could be crashing because of this bug 
[21:47:31] <spatz> I use kde and have no crashing
[21:47:48] <ayoy> yeah, me too actually
[21:47:51] <ayoy> everything's fine
[21:47:59] <wired> not any occasional crashes?
[21:48:03] <ayoy> not at all
[21:48:08] <spatz> not for a long time
[21:48:12] <wired> thats good to hear
[21:48:20] <ayoy> hovewer I have only kdebase-meta
[21:50:12] <wired> okay then, if kde isn't crashing this is not _that_ critical, we can delay our decision on how to fix it until next meeting
[21:50:25] <wired> anyone want to discuss anything else?
[21:50:53] <ayoy> did you vote or something already?
[21:51:05] <spatz> wtf, I can't run the test-case in gdb
[21:51:22] <ayoy> what do you mean by "can't"?
[21:51:28] <ayoy> it doesn't start?
[21:51:49] <spatz> starts, when I run it gives ImportError: No module named backtrace
[21:51:54] <ayoy> huh
[21:52:05] <ayoy> gdb ebuild error?
[21:52:37] <wired> ayoy: spatz nominated me, we voted: hwoarang, spatz, ABCD and myself voted me and chiiph abstained
[21:52:48] <ABCD> USE=-python on gdb might (temporarily) fix it, IIRC
[21:52:49] <wired> ayoy: you wanna leave your vote for the record as well?
[21:53:42] <spatz> ABCD: I'll give that a try, thanks
[21:53:56] <ayoy> wired: wow, congrats! :D
[21:54:15] <ayoy> I can vote for you if you like ;)
[21:54:26] <wired> ayoy: thanks!
[21:54:36] <wired> ayoy: whatever you wish =]
[21:54:43] <ayoy> cool :)
[21:56:05] <nirbheek> (is the meeting over?)
[21:56:50] <wired> ok guys, lets continue technical discussions in -qt
[21:56:58] <wired> meeting is over :)
