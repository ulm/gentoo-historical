<longdescription>
	<p>The WM project manages the wide variety of Window Manager in Portage.
	These include commonbox (open/flux/blackbox), next generation Blackbox
	workalikes (openbox3, kahakai), GnuStep (gnu/afterstep, windowmaker), and
	a number of minimal WM's (ion, ratpoison, etc).</p>
</longdescription>

<goals>
	<p>The goal of the WM project is to support all WM's in Portage and
	any additional packages directly related to these WM's. We are also
	interested in packages that add functionality to the WM, like keygrabbers.</p>
