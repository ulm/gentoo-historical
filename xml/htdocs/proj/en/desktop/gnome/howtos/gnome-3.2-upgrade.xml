<section>
<title>General changes</title>
<body>

<p>
Please see the <uri link="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.2/">GNOME
3.2 Release Notes</uri> and <uri link="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.0/">3.0
Release Notes</uri> for what is new in this major release of GNOME.
</p>

<p>
Briefly: GNOME 3.2 includes two desktop modes&mdash;standard and fallback.
Fallback mode uses <c>gnome-base/gnome-panel</c> and <c>x11-wm/metacity</c>, and
is similar in appearance and behavior to GNOME 2. Standard mode uses
<c>gnome-base/gnome-shell</c> and <c>x11-wm/mutter</c>, and looks and behaves
<e>completely</e> differently from previous GNOME releases. By default, the
choice of desktop mode is determined by the system's graphics hardware and
drivers (standard mode requires modern 3D graphics capabilities).
</p>

<p>There is a <uri link="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Tour">quick
tour</uri> of standard mode's GNOME Shell available on the GNOME website.
For an in-depth guide to using GNOME Shell, see
<uri link="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet">the GNOME Shell
cheat sheet</uri>. GNOME Shell at first may feel alien and limited to an
experienced GNOME 2 user. We strongly encourage users to persist and make
themselves use it for a few days; those who take the time to get used to GNOME
Shell's behavior usually grow to love it and don't want to go back to a
GNOME 2-like desktop environment.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Languages and encodings</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 3.2 obtains user language settings from <c>sys-apps/accountsservice</c>.
The language can be set in GNOME from the <e>My Account</e> entry in the upper
right corner menu. Alternatively, you can directly edit AccountsService user
files. For example, to have user <c>jrandom</c> use British English, you can 
(as root) edit <path>/var/lib/AccountsService/users/jrandom</path> so it reads
the following:
</p>
<pre caption="Simple example of an AccountsService user file">
[User]
Language=en_GB.utf8
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Fonts</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 3.2 uses <c>media-fonts/cantarell</c> as its default font. Unfortunately,
Cantarell currently only includes a subset of the extended Latin alphabet. Users
of languages whose writing systems are not yet covered by Cantarell will
probably want to switch to another font, such as <c>media-fonts/dejavu</c>. This
can be done using <c>gnome-tweak-tool</c> (<e>Fonts</e> tab), or from the
terminal:
</p>

<pre caption="Set DejaVu (size 10) as the default font">
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'DejaVu Sans 10'</i>
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface document-font-name 'DejaVu Sans 10'</i>
$ <i>gconftool-2 -s -t string /apps/metacity/general/titlebar_font 'DejaVu Sans Bold 10'</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Applets</title>
<body>
<p>
GNOME 2 applets cannot be used in GNOME 3.2. Fallback mode allows applets,
although some have not yet been ported to the new, gtk3-based APIs. In
standard mode, there are no applets at all. Some traditional applet
functionality can be replicated using third-party GNOME Shell extensions.
</p>
<p>
In order to manage fallback gnome-panel settings (either add/remove or rearrange
applet positions) one has to hold down the <c>Alt</c> key when clicking
on the panel. This opens relevant menu for changing either panel or applet
settings.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Shut down and reboot</title>
<body>
<p>
GNOME Shell developers made a <uri
link="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/Whiteboards/SystemStopRestart">controversial
decision</uri> to not show any sort of shut down or power off menu by default.
The <e>Power Off</e> menu item becomes visible after clicking on the upper
right corner menu and holding down the <c>Alt</c> key.
</p>

<p>
If you need an easily discoverable GUI for shutting down the machine (for
example, if deploying GNOME 3.2 in a corporate environment where users are
required to turn off their computers at the end of the day), you can install the
alternative-status-menu extension. To do so, emerge <c>gnome-extra/gnome-shell-extensions</c>
and run</p>
<pre caption="Enabling the alternative-status-menu extension"> 
# <i>eselect gnome-shell-extensions enable 'alternative-status-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org'</i>
</pre>
<p>
to enable the extension for all users by default, or use <c>gnome-tweak-tool</c>
(<e>Shell Extensions</e> tab) to enable it on a per-user basis.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Suspend on laptop lid close</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 3 will, by default, suspend a laptop when the lid is closed. If you
do not like this behavior, you can change it via the <c>gnome-tweak-tool</c>
GUI (<e>Shell</e> tab), or using <c>gsettings</c> from the terminal:
</p>

<pre caption="Only turn off the screen when laptop lid is closed on AC power"> 
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power lid-close-ac-action blank</i>
</pre>

<p>
One of the most common reasons for not wanting to suspend on laptop lid close
is to carry a laptop to another room without losing the network connection. To
do so, you can install <c>gnome-extra/office-runner</c>, which allows temporarily
inhibiting GNOME's suspend-on-lid-close behavior for up to 10 minutes.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Icons on the desktop</title>
<body>

<p>
In GNOME 3.2, Nautilus by default no longer manages the desktop, and the
<path>~/Desktop</path> folder is simply treated as a normal folder with files.
</p>

<p>
If you want to have Nautilus manage the desktop like in GNOME 2, you can change
the corresponding setting in the <c>gnome-tweak-tool</c> GUI (<e>Desktop</e> tab),
or use the <c>gsettings</c> command from the terminal:
</p>
<pre caption="Making Nautilus manage the desktop"> 
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Compiz</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 3.2 standard mode (i.e. GNOME Shell) is incompatible with Compiz.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>PulseAudio</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 3.2 requires <c>media-sound/pulseaudio</c> for audio support. Ensure that
you have the <c>pulseaudio</c> USE flag enabled globally (it will be enabled by
default if you use the <c>desktop/gnome</c> portage profile). For troubleshooting
PulseAudio problems, see
<uri link="http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/Documentation">documentation on pulseaudio.org</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Touchpad and other input device customization</title>
<body>

<p>
In GNOME 3, if you have "disable touchpad while typing" selected, the touchpad
will be disabled for 2 seconds after a keyboard key is pressed. In GNOME 2,
this interval was 500 milliseconds. If you like to disable the touchpad
while typing, but prefer the shorter timeout interval like in GNOME 2, you can
emerge <c>gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon</c> with the
<c>short-touchpad-timeout</c> USE flag enabled.
</p>

<p>
GNOME 3 allows setting a custom command for advanced customization of input
device settings. For example, suppose that you want to configure your touchpad
to enable two-finger scrolling (both vertical and horizontal) <e>and</e> edge
scrolling (vertical only). You could do
</p>

<pre caption="Setting a new GNOME input device hotplug script"> 
$ <i>cp /usr/share/gnome-settings-daemon-3.0/input-device-example.sh ~/input-device.sh</i>
$ <i>chmod +x ~/input-device.sh</i>
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.input-devices hotplug-command ~/input-device.sh</i>
</pre>

<p>
and edit <path>input-device.sh</path> so it ends as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="">
# If the device is a touchpad ...
if [[ -z "${device#*TouchPad*}" ]]; then
	# ... enable two-finger scrolling (vertical and horizontal) ...
	xinput set-prop "${device}" "Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling" 1 1
	# ... and edge scrolling (vertical only, no horizontal, no coasting) ...
	xinput set-prop "${device}" "Synaptics Edge Scrolling" 1 0 0
fi
# All further processing will be disabled if $retval == 0
exit $retval
</pre>

<note>
If the custom hotplug command does not terminate with exit value 0,
<c>gnome-settings-daemon</c> will set its own settings on the input device,
likely clobbering the settings that the hotplug command had changed.
</note>

<p>
If, for whatever reason, you want to completely prevent GNOME 3 from
automatically modifying your mouse and touchpad settings (note that this will
<e>also</e> prevent custom input hotplug commands, such as
<path>input-device.sh</path> above, from modifying mice and touchpads!), you
can run the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Prevent GNOME from managing the mouse and touchpad">
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.mouse active false</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>General configurability and extensions</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 3.2 is designed to appear significantly less configurable than GNOME 2.
For example, by default there is no easily discoverable GUI for changing the
Gtk+ theme. Many configuration settings are hidden, but can still be changed
using the <c>gnome-extra/gnome-tweak-tool</c> GUI, or from gsettings (can be
explored using <c>dconf-editor</c>, part of <c>gnome-base/dconf</c>) or gconf
(can be explored using <c>gnome-extra/gconf-editor</c>).
Discussion of most of these hidden settings is outside the scope of this guide.
</p>

<p>
GNOME Shell's behavior can be significantly altered using <uri
link="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Extensions">extensions</uri>. Gentoo
packages the extensions from the official GNOME repository as
<c>gnome-extra/gnome-shell-extensions</c>. GNOME Shell comes with a browser
plugin that allows users to install extensions from the
<uri>https://extensions.gnome.org/</uri> web interface; there are also numerous
developers publishing extensions on various third-party websites.
</p>

<p>
Gentoo uses <c>eselect gnome-shell-extensions</c> to manage system defaults that
control whether extensions that were installed systemwide (i.e. in
<path>/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions</path>) should be enabled.
Newly-installed systemwide extensions start out disabled by default.
</p>
<pre caption="Enabling alternative status menu and dock extensions by default for all users">
# <i>eselect gnome-shell-extensions enable \</i>
  <i>alternative-status-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org dock@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org</i>
</pre>

<p>
Defaults managed by <c>eselect gnome-shell-extensions</c> can be overridden on a
per-user basis using the <uri link="https://extensions.gnome.org/">extensions.gnome.org</uri>
web interface, via <c>gnome-tweak-tool</c> (<e>Shell Extensions</e> tab), or
from the command line using <c>gsettings</c>. For example, to load the
alternative status menu and dock extensions, and disabling all other extensions,
a user can run
</p>
<pre caption="Enabling alternative status menu and dock extensions (and disabling all others!) for the current user">
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions \</i>
  <i>'["alternative-status-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org", "dock@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org"]'</i>
</pre>

<note>
Instead of <c>enabled-extensions</c>, GNOME 3.0 used the <c>disabled-extensions</c>
gsettings key. In GNOME 3.2, this key no longer has any effect.
</note>

<impo>
Extension code quality is highly variable. Some extensions contain memory leaks
and others can render GNOME completely unusable. Gentoo cannot offer support for
problems caused by third-party extensions.

<section>
<title>AMD / ATI</title>

<body>
<p>
GNOME Shell shows <uri link="http://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99">graphical
corruption</uri> under some versions of <c>x11-drivers/ati-drivers</c>
(i.e. FGLRX binary drivers); many of the 11.x versions are known
to be affected. As a workaround, you can force GNOME to start in fallback
mode (see <e>Troubleshooting</e> section below), or alternatively, switch to
open-source drivers.
</p>

<p>
If using open-source AMD / ATI drivers, <c>media-libs/mesa</c> should be built with
the <c>gallium</c> USE flag enabled, and gallium architecture should be enabled
via <c>eselect mesa</c>. Otherwise, GNOME Shell (and GDM, if it was built with
the <c>gnome-shell</c> USE flag) may crash during use or simply fail to start,
forcing GNOME to run in fallback mode.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Intel</title>

<body>
<p>
If using Intel graphics, <c>media-libs/mesa</c> should be built with
the <c>classic</c> USE flag enabled, and classic architecture should be enabled
via <c>eselect mesa</c>. Otherwise, GNOME will likely only run in fallback mode.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>NVIDIA</title>

<body>
<p>
Users must be in the <c>video</c> group to use GNOME 3 with
<c>x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers</c>. If they are not, GNOME Shell will simply
crash at startup.
</p>

<p>
Under some versions of <c>x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers</c>, GNOME Shell system tray shows 
<uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380245">graphical corruption</uri>
(all icons are rendered identically). This problem is fixed in driver versions 280.13
and newer.
</p>

<p>
All versions of <c>x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers</c> are incompatible with GNOME's
color management support. This is because GNOME's color management code relies on
XRandR, and NVIDIA's support for XRandR is currently incomplete.
There is no workaround at this time.
</p>

<p>
As reported in <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375615">bug
#375615</uri>, for some people, certain versions of <c>x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers</c>
(275.28, 280.13, and 285.03 are known to be affected) cause some Gtk+ applications
to hang when terminating. One effect of this is to make GDM freeze after the
password has been entered; similarly, GNOME will freeze when logging out.
The affected versions of <c>nvidia-drivers</c> have been masked. To prevent
this problem, make sure to use an unmasked driver version, for example
275.09.07 or 285.05.09.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Multi-monitor configurations</title>

<body>
<p>
As reported in <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=392013">bug
#392013</uri>, GNOME Shell will refuse to start under "Zaphod mode" dualhead
configurations (i.e. the configurations where multiple <e>Device</e> sections
are used in <path>xorg.conf</path>). If you are using such a dualhead
configuration, you will only be able to use fallback mode.
</p>

<p>
Old ATI cards (X850, M28 and older, and also some X1550 cards) and old Intel
cards (945 series and older) cannot run GNOME Shell on typical multi-monitor
setups. This is because these old graphics cards support a maximum GL texture
size of 2048&times;2048 or less, and GNOME Shell needs the full X display (from
all monitors combined) to fit in one GL texture.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Troubleshooting</title>

<section>
<title>GDM shows an "Oh no! Something has gone wrong" screen</title>

<body>
<p>
This may be caused by a GNOME Shell crash. To help determine the cause, look
in the <path>/var/log/gdm/:0-greeter.log</path> log file. As a workaround, you
may try rebuilding <c>gnome-base/gdm</c> with the <c>gnome-shell</c> USE flag
disabled.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>GDM freezes after the password has been entered</title>

<body>
<p>
This is caused by a bug in <c>x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers</c>.
See <e>Video card compatibility</e> section above.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>GNOME starts in fallback mode</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME will start in fallback mode if it detects that the graphics hardware and
drivers are insufficiently capable. To see a more detailed explanation of why
GNOME does not start in standard mode, run
<path>/usr/libexec/gnome-session-check-accelerated-helper</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Sample gnome-session-check-accelerated-helper output">
$ <i>/usr/libexec/gnome-session-check-accelerated-helper</i>
gnome-session-is-accelerated: No hardware 3D support.
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>GNOME starts in standard mode</title>
<body>

<p>
To force GNOME to start in fallback mode (e.g. due to poor performance or
personal taste), open System Settings (or <path>gnome-control-center</path>
from the terminal), go to <e>System Info &rarr; Graphics</e>, and turn on
<e>Forced Fallback Mode</e>. Alternatively, from a terminal:
</p>

<pre caption="Force GNOME to start in fallback mode">
$ <i>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session session-name gnome-fallback</i>

<section>
<title>Epiphany and Adobe Flash</title>
<body>

<p>
Out of the box, Epiphany 3 cannot load <c>www-plugins/adobe-flash</c> because
the browser links to Gtk+-3 while the plugin links to Gtk+-2. On amd64, there
is a workaround: if you emerge <c>adobe-flash</c> with <c>USE=-64bit</c>, the
plugin will be called through <c>www-plugins/nspluginwrapper</c>, avoiding
incompatibility between Gtk+ versions. On x86, unfortunately there is no good
workaround at this time; we suggest using a gtk2-based browser (such as
<c>www-clients/firefox</c> or <c>www-clients/chromium</c>).

<title>Dependency information about upgrading to GNOME 3.2</title>

<section>
<title>PyGObject</title>
<body>

<p>
In some cases, portage's dependency resolver has trouble figuring out how to
upgrade <c>dev-python/pygobject</c>. You can perform the upgrade manually with
the following command:</p>
<pre caption="Manually upgrade PyGObject">
# <i>emerge -1av pygobject:3 pygobject:2</i>

<section>
<title>GNOME 2-only applets</title>
<body>

<p>
Some GNOME 2 applets and related libraries, such as <c>gnome-extra/deskbar-applet</c>
and <c>dev-cpp/libpanelappletmm</c>, are incompatible with GNOME 3 and will
block the upgrade. You will need to uninstall them before upgrading to GNOME 3.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>New GNOME meta ebuilds</title>
<body>

<p>
With GNOME 3, the meta ebuilds have been split into many ebuilds, and now have
various USE-flags to control features. There are three main meta ebuilds:
<c>gnome-base/gnome</c>, <c>gnome-base/gnome-fallback</c>, and
<c>gnome-base/gnome-light</c>. There are other meta ebuilds pulled in by these,
but users should generally not use them directly.
</p>

<p>
<c>gnome-base/gnome</c> is the recommended way to install GNOME 3. See
the package metadata.xml for descriptions of the available USE-flags.
</p>

<p>
<c>gnome-base/gnome-fallback</c> is the ebuild that installs only the fallback
mode. This ebuild should be used by people who know that their hardware cannot
run GNOME Shell, and do not want to install it.
</p>

<p>
<c>gnome-base/gnome-light</c> is the ebuild that installs the bare minimum
libraries and applications required to run GNOME 3. You can toggle USE-flags to
choose whether to install GNOME Shell, GNOME Fallback, or both. This is
<b>not</b> the recommended way to install GNOME 3, and is merely provided for
the convenience of users.
