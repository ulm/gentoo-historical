<title>System Sounds and ESD</title>
<body>

<p>
Upstream has decided to remove the autospawn capabilities of esd, because they were broken and led
to lots of problems.  This means that, if you use system sounds, you will need to have the esound
boot service running.  It is started like this:
</p>
<pre caption="Starting esound at boot">
# <i>rc-update add esound default</i>
</pre>
<p>
Note that this will not start it until after a reboot, so to start it this time, use this:
</p>
<pre caption="Starting esound at boot">
# <i>/etc/init.d/esound start</i>
</pre>

<section>
<title>Totem doesn't have a xine USE flag!</title>
<body>

<p>
Upstream has decided to remove the xine backend.  I know this makes playing DVDs harder.  However,
you can still play DVDs.  Make sure you have the dvd USE flag, and then run
</p>
<pre caption="Playing DVDs with Totem">
# <i>totem dvd://</i>
</pre>
<p>
This will play the main feature.  There's no menu support, sorry.
