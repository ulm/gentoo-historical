<title>Major Changes</title>
<section>
<title>System Sounds and ESD</title>
<body>

<p>
Upstream has decided to remove the autospawn capabilities of esd, because they were broken and led
to lots of problems.  This means that, if you use system sounds, you will need to have the esound
boot service running.  It is started like this:
</p>
<pre caption="Starting esound at boot">
# <i>rc-update add esound default</i>
</pre>
<p>
Note that this will not start it until after a reboot, so to start it this time, use this:
</p>
<pre caption="Starting esound at boot">
# <i>/etc/init.d/esound start</i>
</pre>

<title>Totem doesn't have a xine USE flag!</title>
<body>

<p>
Upstream has decided to remove the xine backend.  I know this makes playing DVDs harder.  However,
you can still play DVDs.  Make sure you have the dvd USE flag, and then run
</p>
<pre caption="Playing DVDs with Totem">
# <i>totem dvd://</i>
</pre>
<p>
This will play the main feature.  There's no menu support, sorry.

<title>Totem's browser plugin flags have changed!  Now I get seamonkey!</title>
<body>

<p>
Totem's gecko USE flags have been rearranged.  Instead of defaulting to seamonkey and selecting
firefox or xulrunner based on flags, it now defaults to firefox, and selects xulrunner or seamonkey
based on flags.  This is for 2 reasons. First, because seamonkey doesn't run on all arches, so it
needed to have a USE flag that could be masked.  And second, to bring totem in line with the usage
of other Gnome apps, such as epiphany.  Here are the possible combinations of flags, and what they
mean to totem now:
</p>
<pre caption="Totem browser plugin USE flag combinations">
USE="<i>-nsplugin</i>"		# Disable the browser plugin; no gecko will be pulled in
USE="<i>nsplugin -xulrunner -seamonkey</i>"		# Build the plugin against firefox.  This is the default in all profiles.
USE="<i>nsplugin xulrunner -seamonkey</i>"		# Build the plugin against xulrunner.
USE="<i>nsplugin xulrunner seamonkey</i>"		# Build the plugin against xulrunner. (xulrunner beats seamonkey)
USE="<i>nsplugin -xulrunner seamonkey</i>"		# Build the plugin against seamonkey.
</pre>

<title>Known Issues</title>
<section>
<title>Tray icons missing (specifically gnome-power-manager)</title>
<body>
<p>
There is a known bug in Gnome 2.18.1 where tray icons for thing starting up in your session
sometimes do not show up in the tray.  The program is running, but it's tray icon is missing.  This
happens to gnome-power-manager in many cases.  The work-around is to restart the program after the
session is up, and the icon will be there for the rest of the session.  For gnome-power-manager,
follow these steps:
</p>
<pre caption="Getting the gnome-power-manager tray icon back">
In a shell, type:
# <i>killall gnome-power-manager</i>
Then, select System -> Preferences -> Power Management
</pre>
<p>
This will get you your g-p-m tray icon back.
</p>

<section>
<title>Deskbar-applet errors out on login when using tracker</title>
<body>
<p>
There is a known bug in trackerd that causes a race at login, where trackerd is starting, and
deskbar-applet tries to start it via it's dbus interface.  This causes deskbar-applet to error out.
To get deskbar-applet working again (with tracker), follow these steps:
</p>
<pre caption="Getting deskbar-applet working">
In a shell, type:
# <i>killall deskbar-applet</i>
Then, when the dialog comes up asking to restart it, select "Reload".
</pre>
<p>
This must be done once on login.  Deskbar-applet will then work for the rest of the session.
