<section>
<title>Session handling</title>
<body>

<p>
Due to a major rewrite of <c>gnome-base/gnome-session</c>, existing saved
sessions will most likely be lost because of a change in the format.

<title>Brasero Disc Burner</title>
<body>

<p>
Starting with 2.26, Brasero (<c>app-cdr/brasero</c>) is the official optical
media burning utility. It completely replaces nautilus CD burner
(<c>gnome-extra/nautilus-cd-burner</c>) by providing an extension to
nautilus that behaves the same way nautilus CD burner did. In addition to this,
it also provides its own interface for more complex tasks.
</p>

<p>
If you are happy with Brasero after completing the GNOME upgrade, you may
consider uninstalling <c>gnome-extra/nautilus-cd-burner</c>.

<title>Pulseaudio integration</title>
<body>

<p>
GNOME 2.26 now offers complete pulseaudio integration. Please note that on
some hardware, enabling pulseaudio USE flag means that you will have to enable
its support in other applications using sound output (e.g. mplayer). You may want
to refer to the <uri link="http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup">official
pulseaudio documentation</uri> for setting it up.

<title>gnome-desktop API changes</title>
<body>

<p>
Due to the <uri link="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals">GNOME goal</uri> of
removing deprecated libraries usage, gnome-desktop changed its API again. It
should not break anything while upgrading but do not forget to run
<c>revdep-rebuild</c> or <c>emerge @preserved-rebuild</c> at the end of the
upgrade process and check that the old library is gone.

<section>
<title>GNOME and KDE menu file-collision</title>
<body>

<p>
Due to file-collision between GNOME menus and KDE's own menus,
<c>gnome-base/gnome-menus</c> was changed to use a prefixed location for its
menu. It means that menus can disappear in the middle of the upgrade. To get
them back, just make sure you install <c>>=gnome-base/gnome-session-2.26.2</c>
and <c>>=gnome-base/gnome-menus-2.26.2</c>.
</p>
	
<p>
If you are using a login manager and lose your menu, please re-select
gnome as your session at the login prompt. If you start gnome by hand and have
a custom .xinitrc , please export XDG_MENU_PREFIX=gnome- to get your menu back.
If you start gnome by hand but have no .xinitrc, just export XSESSION=Gnome.

<title>Known Issues</title>
<section>
<title>Nautilus constantly restarting</title>
<body>

<p>
With the gnome-session rewrite, <c>gnome-base/nautilus</c> is considered as a
basic part of the GNOME desktop. However, configuring nautilus so that it
doesn't handle the desktop results in <c>gnome-base/gnome-session</c> repeatedly
spawning multiple instances of it at login.
</p>

<p>
Currently the workaround is to <b>not</b> configure nautilus in such a way.
See <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/266398">bug #266398</uri> for updates on
this issue.
