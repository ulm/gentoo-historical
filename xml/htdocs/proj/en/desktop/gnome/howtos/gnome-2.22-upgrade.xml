<title>Seahorse key manager</title>
<body>

<p>
Starting with 2.22, Seahorse (app-crypt/seahorse) is the official key and
password manager, replacing GNOME Keyring Manager
(gnome-extra/gnome-keyring-manager). It handles both GPG and SSH keys, and can
also be used to manage the passwords saved in your GNOME keyring.
</p>

<p>
If you are happy with Seahorse after completing the GNOME upgrade, you may
consider uninstalling gnome-keyring-manager.

<section>
<title>PAM and GNOME Keyring integration</title>
<body>

<p>
Starting with GNOME 2.20, GNOME Keyring (gnome-base/gnome-keyring) started
providing a PAM module (pam_gnome_keyring.so) to automatically unlock your
keyring as you log in to your session, thereby saving you the trouble from
typing two passwords.
</p>

<p>
In GNOME 2.22, this feature is now even more easily configurable, thanks to
sys-auth/pambase that has a gnome USE flag. With this flag enabled, the
pam configuration files in /etc/pam.d/ will automatically have pam_keyring.so
inserted in the right places. Just remember to use "etc-update",
"dispatch-conf" or your other tool of choice after installing pambase to
update those files.

<title>Known Issues</title>
<section>
<title>GNOME no longer available as a session option in GDM</title>
<body>

<p>
GDM uses the files available in /usr/share/xsessions/* to determine which
desktop environments the user has installed and will be able to select from
the "Sessions" menu.
</p>

<p>
The appropriate file for GNOME is now provided by gnome-base/gnome-session-2.22
instead of gnome-base/gdm, and due to this there are appropriate package
blockers in place to avoid file collissions leading to this session file
getting lost. The only thing that can go bad is that gnome-session does not
get upgraded to 2.22 after it was uninstalled to resolve the gdm upgrade
blocker. The symptom would be the lack of a GNOME choice in the GDM
"Sessions" menu, in which case please check that you have gnome-session-2.22.0
or newer installed. Note that this problem can not happen to gnome-base/gnome
meta package users, as it will pull in the appropriate gnome-session package
again.
