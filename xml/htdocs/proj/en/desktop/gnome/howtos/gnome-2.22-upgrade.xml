<title>Automounting of removable media</title>
<body>

<p>
Automounting has seen a few significant changes for Gnome 2.22. It is now
handled by Nautilus instead of <c>gnome-base/gnome-volume-manager</c>. However,
<c>gnome-volume-manager</c> is still used to detect new hardware such as
cameras.
</p>

<p>
Because of this change, there is now an <c>automount</c> use flag on
<c>gnome-volume-manager</c> for users who wish to keep the old behavior. Users
who previously started <c>gnome-volume-manager</c> with non-Gnome desktops are
strongly advised to enable this use flag. Gnome users on the other hand are
strongly advised to make sure that this use flag is not turned on, as it will
cause problems with Nautilus.

<section>
<title>Seahorse key manager</title>
<body>

<p>
Starting with 2.22, Seahorse (<c>app-crypt/seahorse</c>) is the official key and
password manager, replacing GNOME Keyring Manager
(<c>gnome-extra/gnome-keyring-manager</c>). It handles both GPG and SSH keys,
and can also be used to manage the passwords saved in your GNOME keyring.
</p>

<p>
If you are happy with Seahorse after completing the GNOME upgrade, you may
consider uninstalling <c>gnome-keyring-manager</c>.
</p>

<section>
<title>PAM and GNOME Keyring integration</title>
<body>

<p>
Starting with GNOME 2.20, GNOME Keyring (<c>gnome-base/gnome-keyring</c>)
started providing a PAM module (<path>pam_gnome_keyring.so</path>) to
automatically unlock your keyring as you log in to your session, thereby saving
you the trouble from typing two passwords.
</p>

<p>
In GNOME 2.22, this feature is now even more easily configurable, thanks to
<c>sys-auth/pambase</c> that has a <c>gnome-keyring</c> USE flag. With this
flag enabled, the PAM configuration files in <path>/etc/pam.d/</path> will
automatically have <path>pam_keyring.so</path> inserted in the right places.
Just remember to use <c>dispatch-conf</c> or your similar tool of choice after
installing <c>pambase</c> to update those files.

<title>Troubleshooting</title>
<section>
<title>Upgrading to Python 2.5</title>
<body>

<p>
Before upgrading to GNOME 2.22, please make sure you <e>only</e> have
<c>dev-lang/python-2.5*</c> and that your system is fully updated.
</p>

<pre caption="Upgrading python">
# <i>emerge -av dev-lang/python:2.5</i>
# <i>python-updater</i>
# <i>emerge -C dev-lang/python:2.4</i>
</pre>

<warn>
If you open bugs related to Python errors and if you are still using Python
2.4, we <e>will</e> ask you to update to 2.5. The GNOME Herd does <e>not</e>
support GNOME 2.22 with Python 2.4.
</warn>

</body>

<section>
<title>Blocked packages</title>
<body>

<p>
With GNOME 2.22 a few packages were split into two, to allow other applications
to use the previously internal libraries. For example the playlist parser
library found in <c>totem</c> is now split out of it into
<c>dev-libs/totem-pl-parser</c>, so that <c>rhythmbox</c> can depend on it
without depending on the whole of <c>totem</c>.
</p>

<p>
All this results in blockers having to be in place between the packages to avoid
file collisions. To work around it, simply follow the appropriate instructions
in the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?full=1#blocked">handbook</uri>
as instructed by Portage. In particular, temporarily unmerge the conflicting
package and continue as normal, getting the unmerged package back soon via the
meta package or other GNOME parts depending on it.
</p>

<section>
<title>GNOME no longer available as a session option in GDM</title>
<body>

<p>
GDM uses the files available in <path>/usr/share/xsessions/*</path> to determine
which desktop environments the user has installed and will be able to select
from the "Sessions" menu.
</p>

<p>
The appropriate file for GNOME is now provided by
<c>gnome-base/gnome-session-2.22</c> instead of <c>gnome-base/gdm</c>, and due
to this there are appropriate package blockers in place to avoid file
collisions leading to this session file getting lost.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that can go bad is that <c>gnome-session</c> does not get
upgraded to 2.22 after it was uninstalled to resolve the GDM upgrade blocker.
The symptom would be the lack of a GNOME choice in the GDM "Sessions" menu, in
which case please check that you have <c>gnome-session-2.22.0</c> or newer
installed.
</p>

<p>
Note that this problem cannot happen to <c>gnome-base/gnome</c> meta package
users, as it will pull in the appropriate <c>gnome-session</c> package again.
