<title>Getting Ready</title>

<section>
<title>Preparing the environment</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure you add hal, dbus, and cairo to your use flags.  If you plan on using
evolution-exchange, also add kerberos and ldap.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Upgrade Python</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure you are using python 2.4.  Upgrade python to version 2.4 if you are 
still on python 2.3.  If you have not run python-updater since the transition
to 2.4, you should run it now.
</p>

<pre caption="Upgrading python">
# <i>emerge -av python</i>

<section>
<title>Some other things to check</title>
<body>

<warn>
If you have gnome-doc-utils installed, re-emerge it. ( you should now have 
version >= version 0.4.1 )
</warn>

<chapter>
<title>Upgrade to 2.12</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
This is the fun part :)  Upgrade to GNOME 2.12.
</p>

<pre caption="Upgrade to GNOME 2.12">
# <i>emerge -av gnome</i>
</pre>

<p>
Or, if you like not so heavy things:
</p>

<pre caption="Upgrade to GNOME 2.12 lite">
# <i>emerge -av gnome-light</i>
</pre>

<chapter>
<title>Run some revdep-rebuild</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Check if you need to run revdep-rebuild by doing:
</p>
<pre caption="running revdep-rebuild">
# <i>revdep-rebuild -p</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will know if you need to run it because some packages will be listed.
To run it, just remove the "-p" flag.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>So now what?</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Add your user to the plugdev group.
</p>

<p>
Now, exit your current GNOME session, and restart it!
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Want things to automatically automount when you plug them in?</title>
<body>

<p>
Again, make sure you add hal and dbus to your useflags.
</p>

<p>
You should also add your user to the plugdev group after the group is created by the pmount ebuild.  Otherwise, automounting will NOT work.  You will probably have to restart your session after adding your user to the plugdev group.  You can check if your in the plugdev group by typing id into a terminal window.
</p>

<p>
We recommend the use of gamin instead of fam.  One way to use gamin is to have an inotify enabled kernel.  Gamin supports inotify, dnotify, and file-polling.  If you have problems with gamin, you can use fam instead.
</p>

<note>If you would like to know more about gamin configuration, please see <uri>http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/config.html</uri>
</note>

<impo>
Gamin does not have an initscript, so you do not need to add it to any runlevels.
</impo>

<p>
The inotify option is located at "File systems -> Inotify file change notification support".
</p>

<p>
If you choose to use gamin, and have previously used fam, follow the code listing below:
</p>

<pre caption="">
# <i>rc-update del famd</i>
# <i>emerge unmerge fam</i>
# <i>emerge -av gamin</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, update your machine so it recompiles things with the new useflags by using --newuse.  One way to do this is <c>emerge -uDav --newuse world</c>
</p>

<pre caption="updating with the new useflags">
# <i>emerge -uDav --newuse world</i>
</pre>
<p>
Now we need to start dbus and hal. They need to start up every time you restart your computer.
</p>
<pre caption="dbus, hal, gamin">
# <i>rc-update add hald default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/hald start</i>
</pre>
<p>
Don't forget to add yourself to the plugdev group in <path>/etc/group</path>.
</p>
<p>
Now you should be able to start <c>gnome-volume-manager</c> from the commandline and insert a USB stick, watch it automount and place an icon on your desktop :)
</p>
<p>
If you want to change gnome-volume-manager's behavior, start <c>gnome-volume-properties</c> from the commandline.  This should start gnome-volume-manager if it is not already running.
