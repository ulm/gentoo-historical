<title>Font, Theme, and Background Preferences</title>
<body>

<p>
The Font, Theme, and Background preferneces capplets have been merged into the
"Appearance" capplet.  This means that changing almost anything related to the
appearance of your desktop is now done in a single capplet.  Go to System ->
Preferences -> Appearance to change these settings.

<title>Spam Filter Choice in Evolution</title>
<body>

<p>
Evolution now has a real choice of spam filters.  It comes built in with
plugins for Spamassassin and Bogofilter, and can choose which one to use at
runtime.  The USE flags for choosing are now gone.  To choose a spam plugin,
go to Preferences -> Mail Preferences -> Junk and set the Default junk plugin
from the drop box.  It will tell you if you have the correct programs
installed.  If you only have one of Spamassassin and Bogofilter installed, it
will choose that one by default.  If you have both, it defaults to
Spamassassin.
