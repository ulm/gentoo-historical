<title>Notification-related build failures</title>
<body>

<p>
libnotify builds differently based on the version of GTK+ installed on the
system at the time it was emerged.  If you are having problems building things
like Zenity or Rhythmbox that are failing with undefined references to
notification functions, rebuild libnotify after having upgraded GTK+ to 2.10.x.

<title>gnome-settings-daemon fails to start</title>
<body>

<p>
gnome-settings-daemon needs a local dbus session to work, and fails to start if
one is not present.  GDM automatically starts a dbus session for you, but if
you're using some other DM or using startx with a .xinitrc file, you need to
manually start the dbus session.  Put this in your X startup file (.xinit for
startx, .xsession for a DM):
</p>

<pre caption="Starting a dbus session">
eval `dbus-launch --exit-with-session --sh-syntax`
</pre>

<p>
Make sure it's before the line that runs gnome-session (or
gnome-settings-daemon, if you're starting that directly).
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, if you're using startx and not doing anything special in your
.xinitrc, you can remove your .xinitrc and set the XSESSION to gnome in your
.profile or in /etc/rc.conf.  This will correctly start dbus before starting
gnome-session.

<title>IMAP 4rev1 provider is gone in Evolution</title>
<body>

<p>
The IMAP 4rev1 provider has been removed from Evolution in this version.  It is
considered broken and unsupported upstream.  Users should change their accounts
to use the normal IMAP provider instead.
