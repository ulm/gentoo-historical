<title>Notification-related build failures</title>

<p>
libnotify builds differently based on the version of GTK+ installed on the
system at the time it was emerged.  If you are having problems building things
like Zenity or Rhythmbox that are failing with undefined references to
notification functions, rebuild libnotify after having upgraded GTK+ to 2.10.x.
