<title>Notification-related build failures</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>libnotify</c> builds differently based on the version of GTK+ installed on the
system at the time it was emerged. If you are having problems building things
like <c>zenity</c> or <c>rhythmbox</c> that are failing with undefined references to
notification functions, rebuild <c>libnotify</c> after having upgraded GTK+ to 2.10.x.

<title>gnome-settings-daemon fails to start</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>gnome-settings-daemon</c> needs a local dbus session to work, and fails to start if
one is not present. <c>gnome-session</c> automatically starts a dbus session for you,
but if you're using some other WM or using <c>startx</c> with a <path>~/.xinitrc</path> 
file, you need to manually start the dbus session.  Put this in your X startup file
(<path>~/.xinit</path> for <c>startx</c>, <path>~/.xsession</path> for a DM):
</p>

<pre caption="Starting a dbus session">
eval `dbus-launch --exit-with-session --sh-syntax`
</pre>

<p>
Make sure it's before the line that runs <c>gnome-settings-daemon</c>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, if you're using startx and not doing anything special in your
<path>~/.xinitrc</path>, you can remove this file and set the XSESSION to 
gnome in your <path>~/.profile</path> or in <path>/etc/rc.conf</path>.  This
will correctly start dbus before starting gnome-session.

<title>IMAP 4rev1 provider is gone in Evolution</title>
<body>

<p>
The IMAP 4rev1 provider has been removed from <c>evolution</c> in this version.
It is considered broken and unsupported upstream. Users should change their 
accounts to use the normal IMAP provider instead.
