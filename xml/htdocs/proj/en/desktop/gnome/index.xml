	Gentoo GNOME Project aims to bring the current and complete
	GNOME Desktop Environment to Gentoo. We maintain the GNOME core libraries,
	media framework (gstreamer), GNOME Office Applications (gnumeric, abiword,
	evolution) and various applications that are part of the GNOME Desktop.

		We need to get this thing start off so we can start

		<title>Accessibility herd created</title>
		<body>
		<p><i>Sat, 13 March 2004</i></p>
		<p>A gnome accessibility herd has been created to take care of the gnome accessibility framework. 
		With this move we hope to make it easier for accessibility developers and users to come in direct contact with eachother and thereby 
		noticably improve support for these technologies in Gentoo GNOME. The herd will be the joint responsibility of the accessibility project
		 and gnome project. </p>

		<title>How do I turn off desktop icons?</title>
		<body>		
			<p>Desktop icons are drawn by Nautilus. In order to 
			remove them, you have to stop nautilus from drawing the desktop. 
			The quickest way is to modify the Nautilus GConf key to 
			controlling drawing. You can either use
			<c>gconf-editor</c> or <c>gconftool-2</c> to set the
			<path>/apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop</path>.</p>

			<pre caption="using gconftool-2">
% gconftool-2 -s /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop -t bool false
			</pre>

		<title>How do I use Keychain with GNOME?</title>
		<body>
			<p><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain.xml">Keychain</uri>
			manages your SSH keys and SSH agent for you. To use it with your GNOME
			session, you will need to install <c>gtk2-ssh-askpass</c> or
			<c>x11-ssh-askpass</c>. These give an X interface to prompting you for a
			passphrase. Setup Keychain as the guide suggests and you should be prompted
			for your passphrase on your next login.</p>

	 	<title>Why doesn't USE="-gtk gtk2" work?</title>
		<body>
			<p>This is a very common misconception about the usage of the <c>gtk</c>
			USE flag. <c>gtk</c> USE flag represents the choice of enabling any
			GTK+ interface if a choice exists. It does not represent the option
			for GTK+-1.2.x support. On the other hand <c>gtk2</c> USE flag is used
			only in the presences of a choice between GTK+-1.2.x and GTK+-2.x.
			When such a choice is available, <c>gtk2</c> will choose GTK+-2.x
			support over GTK+-1.2.x.</p>
			
			<p>So if you would prefer to have GTK+-1.2 support in a package
			that gives you a choice, use:
			<pre caption="Prefer GTK+-1.2">
USE="gtk -gtk2"
			</pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>If you prefer to have GTK+-2.x support in a package that
			gives you a choice, use:
			<pre caption="Prefer GTK+-2">
USE="gtk gtk2"
			</pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>If you prefer not to have any GTK+ support in a package that
			gives you a choice, use:
			<pre caption="No GTK+">
USE="-gtk"
			</pre>
			Note that in this case, <c>gtk2</c> is not required and has no
			effect on a package that observes both.
			</p>
			
			<p>Therefore <c>USE="-gtk gtk2"</c> is equivalent to <c>USE="-gtk"</c>
			in most packages and if a package only has a GTK+ interface and no
			choice remains except for what version of GTK+ to use, then use
			GTK+-2. But for all intents and purposes, this combination should
			not be used. More importantly, this does not mean you will have a
			GTK+-1 free system because many packages exist that only have GTK+-1
			interfaces.
