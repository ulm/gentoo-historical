<longdescription>
The useflags gtk and gtk2 have a similar and confusing meaning.  The

		<body>		
			<p>Desktop icons are drawn by Nautilus. In order to 
			remove them, you have to stop nautilus from drawing the desktop. 
			The quickest way is to modify the Nautilus GConf key to 
			controlling drawing. You can either use
			<c>gconf-editor</c> or <c>gconftool-2</c> to set the
			<path>/apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop</path>.</p>

			<pre caption="using gconftool-2">
% gconftool-2 -s /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop -t bool false
			</pre>

		<title>How do I use Keychain with GNOME?</title>
		<body>
			<p><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain.xml">Keychain</uri>
			manages your SSH keys and SSH agent for you. To use it with your GNOME
			session, you will need to install <c>gtk2-ssh-askpass</c> or
			<c>x11-ssh-askpass</c>. These give an X interface to prompting you for a
			passphrase. Setup Keychain as the guide suggests and you should be prompted
			for your passphrase on your next login.</p>

		<title>What is FAM, and should I use gamin instead?</title>
		<body>
			<p>
			<uri link="http://http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/">FAM</uri>
			(or the File Alteration Monitor) is a daemon responsible for 
			notifying GUI applications of changes to files. Typically, on a
			GNOME desktop, this is used by nautilus (the file manager), to keep
			file listings current with the underlying system - even when modifications
			to the files are made from outside of nautilus.
			</p>
			<p>
			In short, FAM watches your filesystem to make sure what nautilus
			displays is up to date.
			</p>
			<p>
			<uri link="http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/">Gamin</uri>
			(an alternative to FAM), 
			is library implementation of a subset of FAM's functionality, although
			it's purpose in monitoring the file system for changes, is the same.
			Gamin is not a complete FAM replacement - some of FAM's more exotic
			features are missing, but Gamin's main aims are to be an API/ABI compatible
			replacement for FAM, and to address resource consumption issues.
			</p>
			<p>
			So which of these two should you choose?
			</p>
			<p>
			We'd recommend you use Gamin over FAM for your GNOME desktop. The project
			is now more mature, it doesn't need to run as a daemon (saving some
			resources), and is easier to use than FAM.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you don't have FAM installed, installing gamin is easy:
			<pre caption="Installing gamin">
emerge gamin
			</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
			If you allready have FAM installed, it's still easy to switch to gamin.
			You'll need to stop FAM, remove it, and then install gamin:
			<pre caption="Replacing FAM with gamin">
rc-update del famd default
/etc/init.d/famd stop
emerge -C fam
emerge gamin
			</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
			Now you'll just need to restart GNOME, or nautilus (<c>killall -9 nautilus</c>)
			to use Gamin for file-monitoring.
