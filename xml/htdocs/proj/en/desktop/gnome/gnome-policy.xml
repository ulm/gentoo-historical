<title>Stabilizing GNOME herd packages</title>
<section>
<body>
  
<p>
The GNOME herd stabilizes packages every week on Monday's. The list of
candidate packages for Monday is located at
<uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~allanonjl/gnome/stable_queue</uri>. This file is
group writable (so any member can edit it).

<title>Meta ebuild policy</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The Gnome herd maintains a meta ebuild named gnome.  This meta ebuild is
intended to install all of the packages considered by the upstream Gnome project
as being part of the Gnome Desktop.  It is not intended to be customizable, with
two exceptions: hardware customization (cdr, dvdr, hal), and accessibility.
This is the recommended method of installing the Gnome desktop system.
</p>
<p>
The alternative, if you require specific Gnome programs, is to emerge them
individually.  If, for example, you want to use Evolution for email, you should
emerge evolution.  This should pull in any necessary dependencies to run
evolution.
</p>
<p>
There are many subsets of Gnome that can be installed and usable.  There is no
way that the Gnome herd can support them all, or any significant subset of them.
We do make one such subset available: gnome-light.  This subset is intended to
include the programs necessary for basic desktop functionality without any
additional applications.  It basically includes gnome-session, gnome-panel,
gnome-terminal, nautilus, metacity, and yelp.  This is a desktop, a file
browser, a terminal program, a start menu/panel, and a window manager.  This
subset is largely unsupported (as none of the Gnome herd members actually use
it), but we will fix problems with it as we can.  Gnome-light can be used as a
jumping-off point for installing intermediate subsets of Gnome between it and
the full gnome ebuild, by emerging extra applications as necessary.  No other
subsets, including making the gnome ebuild more customizable with USE flags,
will be supported.
