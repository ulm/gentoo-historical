  <title>Ebuild maintenance</title>
  <body>
  
  <p>
  It's not uncommon that a package is part of sound herd but have a direct
  maintainer.
  To avoid misunderstanding, such packages are to be considered maintained by
  that developer, leaving the herd as a fallback for when the maintainer is
  away for too much time.
  Always try to get a hold of the direct maintainer before touching a package
  that has a direct maintainer.

  <title>Libraries bumps</title>
  
  <body>
  <p>
  Sound software, in particular libraries, is usually fragile, often tailored
  on a specific version of a given library. For this reason, be <b>very</b>
  careful when bumping a package, especially libraries, and always look to the
  ChangeLog to spot possible API changes that might break programs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Examples of libraries that are fragile with version changes are <c>libcddb</c>
  (that used to export transparent types changed to opaque, breaking <c>vlc</c>
  build), <c>libnjb</c> and <c>tunepimp</c>.
  </p>
  
  <warn>
  Don't ever trust the change in version number to assest the extension of
  changes in API and ABI, many libraries changes API with minor version change,
  some also with micro version changes.
