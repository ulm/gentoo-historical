<title>What's Decibel?</title>
<body>

<p>
From the <uri link="http://decibel.silent-blade.org/">homepage</uri>: Decibel
Audio Player is a GTK+ open-source (GPL license) audio player designed for
GNU/Linux, which aims at being very straightforward to use by means of a very
clean and user friendly interface. It is especially targeted at Gnome and will
follow as closely as possible the Gnome HIG.
</p>

<p>
Decibel is a nifty, simple little app. It has as much playback functionality as
you want it to have. It's not an audio Swiss Army knife; for that, take a look
at Banshee, Exaile, or Amarok. It's intended for easy browsing and playing of your
music collection. It supports several audio formats and CD playback, and can
keep track of several different music library locations. (A nice improvement
over other audio applications that track only one library).
</p>

<p>
Decibel mostly uses Python, gtk+, and gstreamer. It also needs a few Gnome
libraries to handle the Gnome keyring for Last.fm integration. It should still
be lightweight even if you don't use Gnome. If you <e>do</e> use Gnome, it will
be fully integrated into your desktop.
</p>

<p>
Decibel has optional additional runtime integration with various Gnome libraries
such as gnomeprint, gtksourceview, wnck, gnome-applets, gnome-media,
totem-pl-parser, and a few others. More on this later.

<title>Installation</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Sync your Portage tree to make sure you'll be getting the latest Decibel
version. It's currently marked ~arch, so you'll need to keyword it in
<path>/etc/portage/package.keywords</path> before installing.
</p>

<pre caption="Keywording Decibel">
# <i>echo "media-sound/decibel-audio-player" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next, let's take a look at the available USE flags. Since Decibel uses the
modular gstreamer framework, you can choose the kinds of audio formats you want
to be able to play. Decibel currently supports WMA (via ffmpeg), mp4 (aac), mp3,
FLAC, Musepack, and Ogg Vorbis.
</p>

<p>
Here are the USE flags available for the Decibel ebuild:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>USE flag</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>aac</ti>
  <ti>Enables support for MPEG-4 AAC audio (mp4)</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>cdaudio</ti>
  <ti>Adds support for CD audio playback and lookups via CDDB</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>gnome</ti>
  <ti>Enables additional integration with the Gnome desktop</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>libnotify</ti>
  <ti>
    Enables desktop notification on track change. You'll get a customizable
    little popup window.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>musepack</ti>
  <ti>Enables support for the Musepack (mpc) audio codec</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Decibel's ebuild depends on <c>gst-plugins-meta</c>, a metapackage that provides
most of the audio codecs. You can add support for the desired codec by
activating the appropriate USE flag for <c>gst-plugins-meta</c>:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>USE flag</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ffmpeg</ti>
  <ti>
    Adds support for audio formats that use the ASF container, such as
    Windows Media Audio (WMA)
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>flac</ti>
  <ti>Adds support for FLAC: Free Lossless Audio Codec</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>mad</ti>
  <ti>
    Adds support for mp3 playback via MAD, a high quality decoder library
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>vorbis</ti>
  <ti>Adds support for the Ogg Vorbis (ogg) audio codec</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
You can set your desired USE flags globally in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>, or
locally in <path>/etc/portage/package.use</path>. For example, to enable support
for everything but Musepack, you could do the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting USE flags in package.use">
# <i>echo "media-plugins/gst-plugins-meta ffmpeg flac mad vorbis" >> /etc/portage/package.use</i>
# <i>echo "media-sound/decibel-audio-player -musepack aac cdaudio gnome libnotify" >> /etc/portage/package.use"</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once your flags are set, install Decibel:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing Decibel">
# <i>emerge -avt decibel-audio-player</i>
</pre>

<p>
One thing Decibel <e>doesn't</e> do is edit tags. Its creators believe such
functionality is best provided by dedicated tag editing applications. Remember,
Decibel focuses on being a <e>real</e> audio player focused on playback. There
are <uri link="http://packages.gentoo.org">plenty of other tagging apps</uri>
available, such as <uri
link="http://pwp.netcabo.pt/paol/tagtool">TagTool</uri>.
