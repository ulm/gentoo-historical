<description>
  The Gentoo Accessibility Project provides a way for Gentoo developers in
  various teams to co-operate on making Gentoo more accessible to disabled
  users.
</description> 
 
<longdescription>
  This project will help to make gentoo more accessible to disabled users,
  and support them as well. We intend to work closely with 
  <uri
  link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop">the Desktop</uri> (and
  in particular <uri
  link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/gnome">the GNOME
  team</uri>), <uri
  link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/kernel">the Kernel</uri>, and
  <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base">the Base System</uri>
  teams to help resolve accessibility issues that come up with <uri
  link="http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=app-accessibility;name=gnopernicus">gnopernicus</uri> and other gnome-accessibility applications. We do not
  intend to make the applications themselves accessible. Rather, we leave that
  to the upstream authors. However, we can suggest default settings that may
  help make an application more usable to a disabled user.
</longdescription>

<goals>
 <p>
  We can not currently support other desktop environments, because we have not
  found any others that offer usable accessibility features. <uri
  link="http://www.kde.org">KDE</uri> and others have tried, but currently
  <uri link="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</uri> has been the most successful.
 </p>

 <p>
  We also intend to help see that <uri
  link="http://www.linux-speakup.org">speakup</uri> is included in the
  different kernel sources that Gentoo offers, such as <uri
  link="http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=sys-kernel;name=gentoo-sources">gentoo-sources</uri>,
  <uri
  link="http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=sys-kernel;name=xfs-sources">xfs-sources</uri> and others.
  We are actively seeking to recruit a dedicated kernel hacker to work with
  <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/kernel">the Kernel
  team</uri> to make sure that our kernel sources have the most updated <uri
  link="http://www.linux-speakup.org/download.html">speakup accessibility
  patches</uri>.
 </p>

 <p>
  We also intend to suggest, or add other accessibility applications to
  portage that will be useful. For example, we recently added <uri
  link="http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=sys-apps;name=brltty">brltty</uri>
  to portage.
 </p>

 <p>
  We aim to make the Gentoo installation process accessibility friendly as
  well.  To that end, speakup is included on the official <uri
  link="http://whttp://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/release/2005.0/x86-release-notes.xml">2005.0
  x86 release</uri> of Gentoo's LiveCD.
  We will be working closely with the <uri
  link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng">Release Engineering team</uri>
  to make sure that speakup is included on all future releases of the LiveCD
  as well.  Additionally, we would like to see it on the installation CDs of
  the other architectures in the future.  Eventually, we would like to see
  brltty included on the installation CD as well however, this will happen in
  a future release, as the package requires testing.
