<p>
   The aim of the Gentoo Server Project is to make Gentoo Linux more
   appealing to the enterprise market.  Large institutions have
   different needs than small business and home users.  The network
   in these institutions are more complex and have different
   demands.

<title>I Want to Participate</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
To participate in the Gentoo server project first join the mailing list at <i>gentoo-server@gentoo.org</i>. Then ask if there are plans to support something that you are interested in, propose a new subproject that you are interested in or choose one of the planned subprojects to work on. You may talk to the developers and users in the IRC channel <i>#gentoo-server</i> on <i>irc.freenode.net</i> for more information or just to chat about the project or any subprojects. If you don't have the ability to actively help by contributing work we will always need testers to maintain the security and stability of the overall product. All development, testing, and productive comments and feedback will be greatly appreciated.
