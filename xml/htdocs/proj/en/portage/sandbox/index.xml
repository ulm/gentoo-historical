    The Gentoo Sandbox Project is devoted to maintaining
    and updating the Gentoo sandbox library.

<p>
Sandbox is a library (and helper utility) to run programs in a "sandboxed"
environment.  This is used as a QA measure to try and prevent applications from
modifying files they should not.
</p>
<p>
For example, in the Gentoo world we use it so we can build applications as root
and make sure that the build system does not do crazy things outside of its
build directory.  Such as install files to the live root file system or modify
config files on the fly.
</p>
<p>
For people who are familiar with the Debian "fakeroot" project or the RPM based
"InstallWatch", sandbox is in the same vein of projects.

<p>
The development and maintenance of sandboxing-related tools and
libraries. These exist as a control method that allows portage to
be assured that all files executed operate only in monitored locations
and can be tracked in portage's database for later reversing.
