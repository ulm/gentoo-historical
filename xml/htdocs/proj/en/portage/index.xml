  <description>
    The Portage Development Project is devoted to maintaining
    and updating Portages core functionality and utilities.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
    <p>The Portage Development Project works to provide a continuously
    expanding and developing tool for the management and installation
    of packages. The developers work on providing a coherent system
    that is as trouble free as possible (backwards compatible, automated,
    and simple). Bugs are tracked and fixed from the
    <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">Gentoo bug tracker</uri> and
    developer-developer correspondence is maintained on the
    gentoo-portage-dev mailing list. Another communication channel is
	the #gentoo-portage IRC channel on the freenode network.</p>
  </longdescription>

  <goals>
    <p>The goal of the Portage Development Project stands at providing
    a seamless integration of developer and user tools to aid the growth
    and maintenance of the Gentoo Portage Tree.

<title>Bug Reports</title>
<body>
<p>Please report all bugs you encounter on 
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">our bug tracking system</uri>.
Before opening a new bug report please make sure that the bug has not 
already been reported by another user.</p>
<impo>Do not report bugs/requests about anything other than sys-apps/portage in the Portage Development product</impo>
<p>In your bug report please state clearly:
<ul>
<li>How you triggered the bug (commands executed, files edited, ...)</li>
<li>What portage version you used when you found the bug</li>
<li>If the bug is reproducable</li>
<li>The output of the <c>emerge --info</c> command</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Please don't get too impatient if there is no immideate reaction on your bug,
it can sometimes take a while before a developer has time to look at it (this 
also applies to non-Portage bug reports). Often we'll need additional information
from you while trying to resolve a bug, please provide it as soon as you can, if we
have to wait too long (over a month) we'll likely close the bug as RESOLVED:NEEDINFO,
you can however reopen it when you posted the requested information.</p>
<p>Please do not reopen bugs unless you're in one of the following situations:
<ul>
<li>The bug was marked as RESOLVED:FIXED, but you can still reproduce it with the new 
version that is suposed to contain the fix (the version is generally stated when 
the bug is closed)</li>
<li>The bug was marked as RESOLVED:NEEDINFO and you have provided the requested information</li>
<li>The bug was marked as RESOLVED:WONTFIX, RESOLVED:CANTFIX or RESOLVED:LATER
and you think we misunderstood you. <b>Do not reopen a bug just because you disagree 
with our resolution</b>.</li>
</ul>
Be aware that we will still read comments on bug reports even if the report itself is closed,
so you don't have to reopen it just to get our attention.</p>
<p>Every bug report deals with one specific problem, please respect that and don't talk about
other not directly related bugs on a bug report.</p>
</body>

<section>
<title>Submitting Patches</title>
<body>
<p>If you want to submit a patch, please make sure the patch complies to 
the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Use TABS. Some people like 8 spaces, some people like 4, and some
like 2. Tabs are the happy medium. Patches that use spaces and/or a mix of 
tabs and spaces for indentation will likely be rejected.</li>
<li>Generally submit diff files instead of whole files, only when the diff is 
significantly larger than the file itself or the file didn't exist previously
submitting the whole file is acceptable.</li>
<li>Diffs have to be in unified form (<c>diff -u</c>, <c>svn diff</c>).</li>
<li>Always submit a detailed explanation of what the patch does and, if necessary,
why you chose the specific implementation you submitted (IOW: what's the 
benefit of the patch). Also include any problems and/or drawbacks you think the patch has.</li>
<li>Always state against which version (for releases) or revision and branch (for svn patches)
the patch was made.</li>
<li>Only submit clean patches. Do not include other patches in a
submitted patch. If the code found in a patch does not match the
description of the patch, it will be rejected. Also don't add any unrelated code cleanups
in your patch</li>
</ul>
If the patch is related to a specific bug report, please attach it there as text/plain.
If it is not directly related to a bug report (to your knowledge) please send it to the 
<i>gentoo-portage-dev</i> mailing list and tag the subject with '[PATCH]'.</p>

<title>Access to Portage SVN repositories</title>
<body>
<p>The Portage sourceode is maintained within a SVN repository on the Gentoo SVN server. 
This server is only accessible for Gentoo developers, it doesn't offer anonymous access.
If you are a dev: The main repository is located at <uri>svn+ssh://cvs.gentoo.org:/var/svnroot/portage/main</uri>,
please note that it is subject to strict access controls, only people listed
in the developers section on this page are able to commit to it. Thanks to former Portage Project lead Nicholas Jones (carpaski) there is also an unofficial 
anonymous access to the repository, it is located at <uri>svn://twobit.net/portage/main</uri>.</p>
<impo>That anonymous repository is currently out of date. An official replacement for
it should be online soon.</impo>
<note>It is assumed you know how to work with Subversion.</note>
<p>The repository currently contains the following branches:
<ul>
<li>trunk: the current main development line based on the 2.0 codebase</li>
<li>branches/2.1-experimental: the former development line, now abandoned (don't use it unless you want to backport stuff)</li>
<li>branches/prefix: experimental branch with support for prefix installs</li>
<li>branches/savior: experimental branch containing a complete rewrite (this is supposed to become portage-3 one day)</li>
<li>branches/2.0.54: stable maintenance branch</li>
</ul>
<note>The old CVS repository still exists, but is not updated anymore or used in any other way.</note>
</p>
