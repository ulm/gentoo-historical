  <description>
    The Portage Development Project is devoted to maintaining
    and updating Portages core functionality and utilities.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
    <p>The Portage Development Project works to provide a continuously
    expanding and developing tool for the management and installation
    of packages. The developers work on providing a coherent system
    that is as trouble free as possible (backwards compatible, automated,
    and simple). Bugs are tracked and fixed from the
    <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">Gentoo bug tracker</uri> and
    developer-developer correspondence is maintained on the
    gentoo-portage-dev mailing list. Another communication channel is
	the #gentoo-portage IRC channel on the freenode network.</p>
  </longdescription>

  <goals>
    <p>The goal of the Portage Development Project stands at providing
    a seamless integration of developer and user tools to aid the growth
    and maintenance of the Gentoo Portage Tree.
    </p>

<title>Bug Reports</title>
<body>
<p>Please report all bugs you encounter on 
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">our bug tracking system</uri>.
Before opening a new bug report please make sure that the bug has not 
already been reported by another user.</p>
<impo>Do not report bugs/requests about anything other than sys-apps/portage in the Portage Development product</impo>

<p>
In your bug report please state clearly:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How you triggered the bug (commands executed, files edited, ...)</li>
<li>What portage version you used when you found the bug</li>
<li>If the bug is reproducable</li>
<li>The output of the <c>emerge --info</c> command</li>
</ul>

<p>Please don't get too impatient if there is no immideate reaction on your bug,
it can sometimes take a while before a developer has time to look at it (this 
also applies to non-Portage bug reports). Often we'll need additional information
from you while trying to resolve a bug, please provide it as soon as you can, if we
have to wait too long (over a month) we'll likely close the bug as RESOLVED:NEEDINFO,
you can however reopen it when you posted the requested information.
</p>

<p>
Please do not reopen bugs unless you're in one of the following situations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The bug was marked as RESOLVED:FIXED, but you can still reproduce it with the new 
version that is suposed to contain the fix (the version is generally stated when 
the bug is closed)</li>
<li>The bug was marked as RESOLVED:NEEDINFO and you have provided the requested information</li>
<li>The bug was marked as RESOLVED:WONTFIX, RESOLVED:CANTFIX or RESOLVED:LATER
and you think we misunderstood you. <b>Do not reopen a bug just because you disagree 
with our resolution</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be aware that we will still read comments on bug reports even if the report itself is closed,
so you don't have to reopen it just to get our attention.
</p>

<p>Every bug report deals with one specific problem, please respect that and don't talk about
other not directly related bugs on a bug report.</p>

<title>Testing multiple Portage versions</title>
<body>
<note>This section only applies to Portage 2.1.2 or later</note>
<p>There are various reasons why you'd want to have multiple versions of portage 
available at the same time without having to install them as system default.
Examples would be to check which versions are affected by a specific bug, to
test new features before deploying a new version or have a git checkout available
for testing while keeping a stable release for normal operation.</p>
<p>As of Portage-2.1.2 one can have and use an arbitrary number of Portage 
installations parallel to each other by adjusting the two environment variables
<c>PATH</c> and <c>PYTHONPATH</c>. For example if you have a checkout of the
master branch at <path>/checkouts/portage</path> you'd set them like this:</p>
<pre caption="settings to use portage master branch">
export PYTHONPATH="/checkouts/portage/pym${PYTHONPATH:+:}${PYTHONPATH}"
export PATH="/checkouts/portage/bin:${PATH}"
</pre>
<p>With those settings calling tools like <c>emerge</c>, <c>repoman</c> or 
<c>ebuild</c> will pickup the correct locations to import libraries. External 
tools like gentoolkit or porthole may or may not respect those settings though.
Setting <c>PATH</c> isn't even necessary if you always call the commands by their full 
name (e.g. <c>/checkouts/portage/bin/emerge</c> instead of <c>emerge</c>).</p>

<section>
<title>Submitting Patches</title>
<body>
<p>If you want to submit a patch to sys-apps/portage or a related package, please make 
sure the patch follows these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use TABS. Some people like 8 spaces, some people like 4, and some
like 2. Tabs are the happy medium. Patches that use spaces and/or a mix of 
tabs and spaces for indentation will likely be rejected.</li>
<li>Generally submit diff files instead of whole files, only when the diff is 
significantly larger than the file itself or the file didn't exist previously
submitting the whole file is acceptable.</li>
<li>Diffs have to be in unified form (<c>diff -u</c>, <c>git diff</c>).</li>
<li>Always submit a detailed explanation of what the patch does and, if necessary,
why you chose the specific implementation you submitted (IOW: what's the 
benefit of the patch). Also include any problems and/or drawbacks you think the patch has.</li>
<li>Always state against which version (for releases) or revision and branch (for git patches)
the patch was made.</li>
<li>Only submit clean patches. Do not include other patches in a
submitted patch. If the code found in a patch does not match the
description of the patch, it will be rejected. Also don't add any unrelated code cleanups
in your patch</li>
<li>Python docstrings should conform to the <uri link="doc/policies/docstring-spec.xml">
Portage Docstring Specification</uri>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the patch is related to a specific bug report, please attach it there as text/plain.
If it is not directly related to a bug report (to your knowledge) please send it to the 
<c>gentoo-portage-dev</c> mailing list and tag the subject with '[PATCH]'.</p>
<note>Patches for packages NOT related to sys-apps/portage go on 
<uri>http://bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, please do not send them to the gentoo-portage-dev 
mailing list</note>

<title>Access to Portage GIT repositories</title>

<uri link="http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/portage.git;a=summary">GitWeb</uri>
</note>
<p>
The repository currently contains the following branches (incomplete list):
</p>

<ul>
