<title>Can I mount the portage tree ( /usr/portage ) via NFS?</title>
<body>

<p>
Mounting <path>/usr/portage</path> over NFS is possible.  However you must be
careful to run <c>emerge --metadata</c> on all clients who are mounting the tree 
over NFS.  Otherwise their Portage cache's will be stable and Portage will run rather
slowly. You need not run <c>emerge --sync</c> on every client.  If you encounter
problems with an NFS setup it is important that you ensure you have the proper locking
daemons on both the NFS client machines and the NFS server machine.  Portage uses
hardlinks over NFS in an attempt to lock files; if the locking daemon fails to lock
files Portage may complain about failed or stale locks.  There is a script 
<path>/usr/lib/portage/bin/clean_locks</path> that can be used to clean out old lockfiles.
