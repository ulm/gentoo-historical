<title>Portage upgrades</title>
<body>
<p>Often the solution to a portage related problem is to simply update portage
first. We recommended to do that regulary (every three or four months), as over
time the portage tree will make use of features introduced by new portage 
releases, and that will often break old versions. We generally make sure that
the tree is compatible with portage versions released in the past six months, so
if you don't have version released in that timeframe it is possible that you
won't be able to use the tree anymore.</p>
<p>The recommended way to upgrade portage is a simple <c>emerge portage</c> without
any options, especially without the <c>--update</c> option as it causes some unwanted
behavior for single package updates.</p>
