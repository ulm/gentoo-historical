<title>Manually fixing portage</title>
<section>
<title>Purpose</title>
<body>

<p>
This section will tell you how to manually update/fix your portage installation
in case you can't run <c>emerge sys-apps/portage</c>. While not hard it is
still to be done with great care, so please follow the listed steps exactly
(but apply common sense when necessary).
</p>

<section>
<title>Getting a portage tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
The first step to do is to get the tarball of a current portage version. In the
following text we will use <e>portage-2.1.1</e> as an example (as this is the
current stable version at the time of this writing), please replace that with a
version present in the tree.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the exact reason portage doesn't work for you anymore it may still
be possible to use it to fetch the tarball for you, so as a first step please
try to run <c>emerge --fetchonly sys-apps/portage</c>, only if that doesn't
work you have to manually fetch the tarball with:
</p>

<pre caption="Fetching portage tarball with wget">
# <i>wget -P /usr/portage/distfiles http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/portage-2.1.1.tar.bz2</i>
</pre>

<p>
After that you should have the tarball available as
<path>/usr/portage/distfiles/portage-2.1.1.tar.bz2</path>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Replacing the installed version</title>
<body>

<p>
The next step is to unpack the tarball to a temporary location, using
<path>/root/portage-recover</path> as example the commands to do that are:
</p>

<pre caption="Unpacking portage tarball">
# <i>cd /root</i>
# <i>mkdir portage-recover</i>
# <i>cd portage-recover</i>
# <i>tar xfj /usr/portage/distfiles/portage-2.1.1.tar.bz2</i>
</pre>

<p>
After you have done this it's just a matter of replacing the python and bash
files of your existing installation with the ones from the tarball (in most
cases anyway). To do so please run:
</p>

<pre caption="Replacing installed files">
# <i>cd /root/portage-recover/portage-2.1.1</i>
# <i>cp -R pym bin /usr/lib/portage/</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now you should have a working portage install again. To ensure a consistent
system state however you should now run <c>emerge sys-apps/portage</c> again
immediately.
</p>

<p>
If you get a <e>command not found</e> error message when you try to run
<c>emerge</c> you have to recreate the symlink:
</p>

<pre caption="Recreating the emerge symlink">
# <i>ln -s ../lib/portage/bin/emerge /usr/bin/emerge</i>
</pre>

<p>
If these steps didn't work for you your problem is likely not a broken portage
installation but something else beyond the scope of this document. Please
recheck the <uri link="/proj/en/portage/doc/common-problems.xml">list of common
problems</uri> and also look in <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugzilla</uri> if the problem is reported there.
