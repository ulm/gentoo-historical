<description>The Gentoo Bug Cleaners project aims to clean up the oldest bugs in Bugzilla.</description>
<longdescription><p>Our goal is twofold, the main purpose of this project is to close bugs on Bugzilla that do no longer apply due to versions and/or packages that are no longer present in the Portage tree; as a side effect, it also tries to look for solutions to the oldest bugs. For those that still have use, it attempts to inform the persons involved in the bug that the bug is still open if the bug is important; inviting them to take a decision on it.</p></longdescription>
