option antarus is eliminated (betelgeuse trans-defeats antarus, and antarus does not trans-defeat betelgeuse)
option betelgeuse is eliminated (quantumsummers trans-defeats betelgeuse, and betelgeuse does not trans-defeat quantumsummers)
option calchan is eliminated (antarus trans-defeats calchan, and calchan does not trans-defeat antarus)
option swift is eliminated (quantumsummers trans-defeats swift, and swift does not trans-defeat quantumsummers)
the Schwartz set is {quantumsummers}

result: option quantumsummers wins
