<p>
Every person who is eligible to vote in the upcoming elections may be nominated

<title>Voters</title>
<body>

<p>
People who are eligible to vote in this election are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everybody who ever voted in a trustee election</li>
  <li>
    Everybody who was a Gentoo Developer during last 365 days dated from the
    close of election poll.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
We have prepared lists of <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~jmbsvicetto/trustees-election/eligible-active-devs-sorted">all
eligible current Gentoo Developers</uri> and <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~jmbsvicetto/trustees-election/gentoo-foundation-members">all
eligible Gentoo Foundation members</uri>. If you can't find your name on any of
those lists and think you should be eligible to vote, please contact election
officials.
</p>

<p>
Those lists are still considered provisional. We are currently trying to
complete them, which is problematic because <uri
link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~jmbsvicetto/trustees-election/missing-join-date">some
Gentoo Developers</uri> miss their join dates in LDAP. If you are one of those
people, please contact election officials with your Gentoo join date.
