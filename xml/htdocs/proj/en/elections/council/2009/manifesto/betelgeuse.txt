Betelgeuse's manifesto for 2009 elections
=========================================

Background
----------

* Gentoo developer since 2005
* Java project lead since 2007
* Recruiters project lead since 2007
* Council member since 2007

Basically I should have needed technical background for most matters. If am
elected, I won't be dropping out in the middle of the term unless of I get hit
by a bus etc.

Current Priorities
------------------

1. Things that make me money
2. University studies
3. Golf
4. Gentoo

Don't expect me to be able to work on Gentoo full time but as can be seen from
gentoo-dev I do try to keep active on the mailing list and follow things in
general. `My commit stats <http://cia.vc/stats/author/betelgeuse>`_

What I care about?
------------------

* Technical issues
* Making ebuild writing easier --> new EAPIs

Some argue that knowing all different EAPIs is hard. Usually developers only
need to know the latest one as when writing ebuilds you can just use the latest
one.

Things I don't find interesting
-------------------------------

* Handling personal conflicts

Ideally we would all just get along but of course that's not realistic. I spend
my free time on Gentoo so I rather spend it on things I find interesting but if
need be I can also make decisions on these matters (and they won't be done with
a random number generator).

Good ideas for council meetings (not necessarily my own)
--------------------------------------------------------

* If something is doesn't make a meeting because of time constraints it should be first on the agenda next time
* More voting instead of just discussion
* Make it easier to do/follow council work

  - Maybe a web application would help (prioritizing agenda,voting etc)

My opinions on some issues that come to mind
--------------------------------------------

* GLEP 55: We need this in the long term

  - I don't particularly care about the way the goals are met as long as the
    decision is done based on technical merits

* PMS: Documenting Portage behavior is good

  - Portage has changed behavior without EAPI bumps which we must avoid
  - Ideally the figure head would be a Gentoo developer

* email me and I will add things if you want my opinion on something

What Gentoo needs?
------------------

Gentoo needs people actually writing code for core parts like Portage.
Discussion and specifications do you little good if Portage doesn't gain 
support for new EAPIs.
