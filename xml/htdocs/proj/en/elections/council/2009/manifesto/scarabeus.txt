Who on earth is this person?
============================

Gentoo part
-----------

I am kde team member where I am responsible for making sure our overlay works
out well and recruiting new minions for our team. You can also find me messing
around various eclasses (git/cmake/kde) where I try to implement requests as
fast as possible in usable manner. Some people might noticed that I am also
member of Sunrise team. The Sunrise overlay is nice overlay where users can
commit ebuilds directly. And last but not least I am in X11 team, where I try
to mess around -ati and mesa ebuilds, which I personally hope are working for
you flawlessly ;] I started using gentoo in 2002/3 and as developer you might
see me since 2008/11.

Personal part
-------------

For those that are interested about knowing whom I am in real life it is quite
boring. I am 23 years old student of CULS (www.czu.cz/en/) where I study IT. I
am also university employee, where I work with windows/linux stuff and teach
stuff like GPS. Also I like good beer and cookies, if any of you would like to
bribe me ;]

Plans/Goals for my term
=======================

The stuff in here is not ordered by priority, but by the moment I find them on
the various places on my disk where I store notes ;]

GLEP rules
----------

We should clear out some project approach for handling new gleps so we would
avoid the drama and flames on -dev when there is something not popular enough
announced. This will probably need update for glep-1 and friends so it will
need proper discussion with all interested parties.

GIT migration
-------------

Surprisingly as kde team has kde-testing overlay where, I spent most of my
time, I have really strong feelings against cvs so it is always fight with
inner me when I need to commit in main tree. Git would allow us big teams
handle our bumps/removals more nicely (no need for 260 commits per each). So I
would probably focus on working with Robin on all missing parts to make it
done. I won't elaborate here more because tanderson and Calchan described the
git benefits quite well :]

Promote HT usage and Sunrise
----------------------------

The herd-testers and Sunrise allow us to introduce our project and its workflow
to community where we all can benefit from it. Big part of the current kde team
are former HTs. If we would be able to promote the herd-tester idea we devs
would not need to worry about some regular stuff like bumps and we would
actually just review work of them. Which leads in the end into growing
developer base, because we train people to do the developer work itself :]
Promoting the idea all around gentoo would give us at least some steady flow of
people interested in the gentoo that would be easy-to-pick by any team.
Sunrise, on the other hand, is strictly user overlay which needs to promote
just about announcing that "Even YOU (here imagine uncle Sam) can do your
ebuild". Where the overlay usage can in long term provide new developers and
actually promote gentoo in way where anyone can fix the stuff that is itching
him.

Herds and manpower distribution
-------------------------------

The current structure allows that some parts of the gentoo are totally
unmaintained and bugs practically end up in the black hole. We should have some
reasonable structure preventing this. The default structure is to be decided
but I would see it something like gentoo_bugs target where all devs would be.
The devs would be free to remove themselves, but aggregating the bugs into
specific imap folder should not be hard, so it won't definitely harm a kitten
and we all would actually know that something wrong is happening somewhere.
Also, when bugs are assigned, the announcement information to the bug would be
appended informing that the team is currently in trouble and the bugs including
patches are highly appreciated. So this is my basic unpolished idea about what
I would like to create in this area :]

Sum up
======

These are the areas that I would like to focus but they are definitely not the
only ones I will be working in. There are lot of things I would like to do, but
I am only one person and a day has 24 hours. So I will do my best to implement
as much shiny as possible at best possible quality. My effort will definitely
be focused to better experience in development and gentoo usage as whole.

Endline
=======

I would really like to express my gratitude for being nominated and I really
hope I would not fail your trust in this meatbag called scarabeus. Also i would
like to thank to tanderson from whom i stole this idea of using rst template
file.
