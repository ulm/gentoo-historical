Thanks to all 117 developers who voted on these elections. There were 329
developers elegible to vote, so we had a little less than 36% who performed
their (volunteer) duty.

The final ranking gave us the following 7 new council members:

  vapier
  dberkholz
  uberlord
  flameeyes
  lu_zero
  betelgeuse
  amne

Thanks to all who participated!

The election officials,
  Shyam Mani      (fox2mike)
  Hans de Graaff  (graaff)
  Sven Vermeulen  (SwifT)
