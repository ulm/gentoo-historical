The recruiters subproject provides a central location for information about
developer recruitment and recruiter policy.
</description>

<longdescription>
Gentoo's true strength is its impressive and constantly evolving developer base.
It's the job of recruiters to manage the growth of the development team by
locating, approving, and managing new developers to add further innovative
talent to our already strong organization.

<title>What does it take to be a recruiter?</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Recruiters need to possess several talents in order to successfully oversee
additions to the development team.  First and foremost, a recruiter needs to be
a good judge of character. While most new developer sponsors pick only the best
candidates, there have been and will be occasional duds. Recruiters need to be
able to analyze an individual's background, experience, and past contributions,
then use that information to decide whether or not to accept a developer.
Recruiters also need to be aware of the big picture in order to recognize
weaknesses in the organization and accept developers who will shore up those
weaknesses.  Remember, recruiters always have the final say on new developers.
Never be afraid to say no, but always offer a detailed explanation of the
decision.
</p>

<extrachapter>
<title>What does the recruitment process involve?</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
All new developers must have a mentor. This mentor will be responsible for
guiding the new developer through the new developer process and offering help to
the developer futurely. Mentors should assist by pointing the new developer to
developer-related documentation, answering questions, and explaining the ins and
outs of working for Gentoo as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
A bug must be filed for each new developer. The bug summary should be 'New
Developer (real name) (nickname).' The bug must contain the new developer's real
name, email address, and reason for joining the project.  Real names must be
provided for all developers, including infrastructure and documentation. Any
exceptions to this for extenuating circumstances will be considered on a
case-by-case basis. No exceptions will be made for people doing copyrightable
work (ebuilds, software, scripts, documentation, etc.).  The bug should also
contain who the new developer's mentors will be and any other information the
mentor wishes to provide. Please do not attach quiz answers or encryption keys
to the bug -- these should be emailed to recruiters.  The new developer and all
mentors should be CCed on the bug to keep everybody in the loop.
</p>

<p>
A developer's bug tracks his progress throughout his lifetime at Gentoo.  If the
developer retires, the initial recruitment bug is used to track all the things
that must be done to retire a dev. If the developer later returns, the same
initial recruitment bug is used to track it.  Returning developers are subject
to the same criteria as a first-time developer and must go through the same
steps to rejoin Gentoo.
</p>

<p>
The new developer will have a mentoring and evaluation period of up to a month.
This will be determined by the recruiter based on feedback from the mentor.
During this mentoring period, the mentor is responsible for providing the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz">quiz</uri>.  <!--	<uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/copyright">copyright</uri> document
to the new developer.  Copyright documents should be signed, scanned, and sent
to recruiters, or optionally GPG-signed. Hand signatures are preferred. See the
copyright information page linked above for more information.--> Additionally,
new developers should be responsive to questions from recruiters during this
waiting period. If the new developer will be absent for significant periods of
time during this period, the bug should be updated to reflect this. If a new
developer is unresponsive to pings, recruiters will close the bug. Bugs closed
under these circumstances may be reconsidered at a later time.
</p>

<p>
Developers taking the quiz (linked above) should consult technical and policy
documentation for answers. Mentors may provide as much assistance as needed.
Along with the quiz <!--and copyright document-->, an OpenSSH SSH2 DSA public
key for infrastructure access should be provided to recruiters.
</p>

<p>
Developers working strictly on infrastructure, documentation, or bug-wranglers
with no CVS access to the Portage tree typically do not need to take the ebuild
quiz. Instead, a staff quiz is provided. See the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz">quiz page</uri> for more
information.
</p>

<p>
Recruiters may reject new developers if they feel it's appropriate.
Additionally, for 30 days after joining, a new developer is considered to be in
a 'probationary period' in which their mentor is responsible for actions taken
by the new developer. This provides a certain level of accountability.

<title>Steps for adding a new developer</title>
<section>
<title>1. Adding the new developer to LDAP</title>
<body>

<p>
At first, start adding the new developer to LDAP. This requires you to
<c>ssh</c> to <i>roadrunner.gentoo.org</i> and use the <c>perl_ldap</c> script
to create the new account.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the initial UID in LDAP">
# <i>ssh roadrunner.gentoo.org</i>
# <i>perl_ldap -b recruiters -c</i>
Enter LDAP Password:

LDAP Perl interface v1.0
[ou=devs] >> <i>A hyakuhei</i>
Adding LDAP user hyakuhei
Enter First Name: Robert
Enter Last Name: Clark
Enter LDAP Password:

done!
</pre>

<p>
Afterwards, the new developer should look like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Informations present in LDAP after addition">
[ou=devs] >> <i>s hyakuhei</i>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
dn:uid=hyakuhei,ou=devs,dc=gentoo,dc=org

             uid: hyakuhei
              cn: Robert Clark
       givenName: Robert
              sn: Clark
    userPassword: {crypt}$1$HP/3wW0V$XUMrrFeQDHiMSGDOIUAbi/

       shadowMax: 99999
   shadowWarning: 15
      loginShell: /bin/bash
   homeDirectory: /home/hyakuhei
           gecos: Robert Clark
  shadowInactive: 15
    shadowExpire: 14883
       gidNumber: 100
       uidNumber: 2159

  gentooLocation: undefined
     gentooRoles: undefined
      gentooJoin: 07 January 2007
            herd: undefined
    gentooStatus: active
          gpgkey: undefined
  gpgfingerprint: undefined
     objectClass: top
                  person
                  organizationalPerson
                  gentooDev
                  inetOrgPerson
                  posixAccount
                  shadowAccount
                  ldapPublicKey
</pre>

<p>
Next step is to fill the remaining informations needed, for example
<c>birthday</c>, <c>gentooLocation</c> and those others listed as
<i>undefined</i>.
</p>

<pre caption="Updating the attribute gentooLocation">
[ou=devs] >> <i>u hyakuhei</i>

done!
</pre>

<p>
Same scheme applies to all those other <i>undefined</i> elements.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards it should look like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Completely filled informations">
[ou=devs] >> <i>s hyakuhei</i>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  posixAccount
                  shadowAccount

</pre>

<p>
Last step in the LDAP procedure is to create the <i>sshPublicKey</i> attribute.
</p>

<p>
This first method requires the public ssh-key of the developer somewhere on
<i>roadrunner</i> in order to import it this way into LDAP.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the attribute sshPublicKey (file method)">
# <i>perl_ldap -b recruiters -M sshPublicKey "$(&lt;hyakuhei.pub)" hyakuhei</i>

Modifying LDAP user hyakuhei

</pre>

<p>
We are done now with adding the developer to LDAP, lets quit now.
</p>

<pre caption="Quitting">
[hyakuhei, ou=devs] >> <i>quit</i>
</pre>

<p>
Next step is to create the <path>userinfo.xml</path> entry for the developer. This is
where <c>perl_ldap</c> comes in handy again.
</p>

<pre caption="Exporting information for userinfo.xml">
# <i>perl_ldap -U hyakuhei</i>
</pre>

<p>
This will create a file called <path>xml</path>, that contains the formatted
content for <path>userinfo.xml</path>. Add this to your local copy of
<path>userinfo.xml</path> (that is located in
<path>gentoo/xml/htdocs/proj/en/devrel/roll-call/</path>) and commit the changes
to the tree.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>2. Setting up the developer's gentooAccess</title>
<body>
	
<p>
In preparation of granting access to cvs and/or svn, the gentoo-core
mailing list or changing his bugzilla login name, you will need to poke one of
the leads to setup the developer's <c>gentooAccess</c>. This is needed,
otherwise he/she won't be able to login to the machines we use in the
development process (dev.gentoo.org and cvs.gentoo.org for example).
</p>

<p>
After a senior devrel member added the <c>gentooAccess</c> portion, you can go
ahead with the next steps.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>3. Granting svn/cvs access</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to grant access to cvs/svn to the newly added developer, you will need
to <c>ssh</c> to <i>stork.gentoo.org</i> and add the username to the appropriate
groups.
</p>

<pre caption="Adding a developer to the groups cvs and svn">
# <i>ssh stork.gentoo.org</i>
# <i>gpasswd -a hyakuhei cvs</i>
Adding user hyakuhei to group cvs
# <i>gpasswd -a hyakuhei svn</i>
Adding user hyakuhei to group svn
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>4. Creating the developer's account on dev.gentoo.org</title>
<body>

<p>
Now get the developer to <c>ssh</c> to <i>dev.gentoo.org</i> as the first login
will trigger the creation of his account. Also tell him, to put his public
ssh-key into <path>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</path>. Otherwise he won't be able to
checkout/commit anything with his developer access.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>5. Changing the developer's bugzilla login</title>
<body>

<p>
After the developer logged in successfully, you can proceed with the recruiter
process. Login to bugzilla, choose <i>Users</i> in the Row <b>Edit</b>.
Supplement the developer's current email adress (the one he used for bugzilla).
</p>

<p>
Change his current <i>Login name</i> to read <b>handle-name@gentoo.org</b> (in
the present case that is <b>hyakuhei@gentoo.org</b>). Hit <i>Update</i> once
you're finished with the modifications.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>6. Subscribing the developer to gentoo-core</title>
<body>

<p>
Every developer needs to be subscribed to gentoo-core. It's the only gentoo
mailing list only devrel/recruiters members can subscribe/remove other devs.
</p>

<p>
Point your browser at <uri>https://lists.gentoo.org/mlmmj/subscribers.cgi</uri>. Fill in the
developer's <i>@gentoo.org</i> email adress and hit <b>Subscribe</b>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>7. Giving the developer operator status in #gentoo-dev</title>
<body>

<p>
Every developer gets operator status (+o) in <i>#gentoo-dev</i>. In order to do
that, you'll have to use FreeNode's ChanServ.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of the current access levels for <i>#gentoo-dev</i>:
</p>

<p>
New developers get <c>LEVEL 20</c> for <i>#gentoo-dev</i> and that is done by
using the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding the developer to ChanServ's access list">
[(status)] <i>/msg -freenode ChanServ access #gentoo-dev add hyakuhei 20</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will see him getting <b>+o</b> by ChanServ. In order to make sure, the
<i>AUTOOP</i> is working, kick the new developer from <i>#gentoo-dev</i> and
wait till he rejoins. If everything is working as it should, he will get the
<b>+o</b> on join by ChanServ.
