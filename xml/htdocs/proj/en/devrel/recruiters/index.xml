The recruiters subproject provides a central location for information about
developer recruitment and recruiter policy.

<longdescription><p>
Gentoo's true strength is its impressive and constantly evolving developer base.
It's the job of recruiters to manage the growth of the development team by
locating, approving, and managing new developers to add further innovative
talent to our already strong organization.

<title>What does it take to be a recruiter?</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Recruiters need to possess several talents in order to successfully oversee
additions to the development team.  First and foremost, a recruiter needs to be
a good judge of character. While most new developer sponsors pick only the best
candidates, there have been and will be occasional duds. Recruiters need to be
able to analyze an individual's background, experience, and past contributions,
then use that information to decide whether or not to accept a developer.
Recruiters also need to be aware of the big picture in order to recognize
weaknesses in the organization and accept developers who will shore up those
weaknesses.  Remember, recruiters always have the final say on new developers.
Never be afraid to say no, but always offer a detailed explanation of the
decision.
</p>

<extrachapter>
<title>What does the recruitment process involve?</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
All new developers must have a mentor. This mentor will be responsible for
guiding the new developer through the new developer process and offering help to
the developer futurely. Mentors should assist by pointing the new developer to
developer-related documentation, answering questions, and explaining the ins and
outs of working for Gentoo as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
A bug must be filed for each new developer. The bug summary should be 'New
Developer (real name) (nickname).' The bug must contain the new developer's real
name, email address, and reason for joining the project.  Real names must be
provided for all developers, including infrastructure and documentation. Any
exceptions to this for extenuating circumstances will be considered on a
case-by-case basis. No exceptions will be made for people doing copyrightable
work (ebuilds, software, scripts, documentation, etc.).  The bug should also
contain who the new developer's mentors will be and any other information the
mentor wishes to provide. Please do not attach quiz answers or encryption keys
to the bug -- these should be emailed to recruiters.  The new developer and all
mentors should be CCed on the bug to keep everybody in the loop.
</p>

<p>
A developer's bug tracks his progress throughout his lifetime at Gentoo.  If the
developer retires, the initial recruitment bug is used to track all the things
that must be done to retire a dev. If the developer later returns, the same
initial recruitment bug is used to track it.  Returning developers are subject
to the same criteria as a first-time developer and must go through the same
steps to rejoin Gentoo.
</p>

<p>
The new developer will have a mentoring and evaluation period of up to a month.
This will be determined by the recruiter based on feedback from the mentor.
During this mentoring period, the mentor is responsible for providing the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz">quiz</uri>.  <!--  <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/copyright">copyright</uri> document
to the new developer.  Copyright documents should be signed, scanned, and sent
to recruiters, or optionally GPG-signed. Hand signatures are preferred. See the
copyright information page linked above for more information.--> Additionally,
new developers should be responsive to questions from recruiters during this
waiting period. If the new developer will be absent for significant periods of
time during this period, the bug should be updated to reflect this. If a new
developer is unresponsive to pings, recruiters will close the bug. Bugs closed
under these circumstances may be reconsidered at a later time.
</p>

<p>
Developers taking the quiz (linked above) should consult technical and policy
documentation for answers. Mentors may provide as much assistance as needed.
Along with the quiz <!--and copyright document-->, an OpenSSH SSH2 DSA public
key for infrastructure access should be provided to recruiters.
</p>

<p>
Developers working strictly on infrastructure, documentation, or bug-wranglers
with no CVS access to the Portage tree typically do not need to take the ebuild
quiz. Instead, a staff quiz is provided. See the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz">quiz page</uri> for more
information.
</p>

<p>
Recruiters may reject new developers if they feel it's appropriate.
Additionally, for 30 days after joining, a new developer is considered to be in
a 'probationary period' in which their mentor is responsible for actions taken
by the new developer. This provides a certain level of accountability.

<section>
<title>When adding yourself to a bug</title>
<body>

<p>
I will be your recruiter. Please send your quizzes to recruiters@gentoo.org
when approved by your mentor. Always add a comment to this bug when you send
something to that address. When the quizzes are sent please contact me by IRC
or email to schedule the first review session. If you think that recruiters
aren't paying attention to this bug at any later point in time, it's your job
to ping us on IRC if you don't want any delays.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>For review session</title>
<body>

<p>
I will go through your answers, find out errors and ask some extras related
and unrelated to the quiz questions. Take your time, it's supposed to be a
learning experience as much as a test of your skills. But just tell me if
you can't absolute find something so that you don't use too much time.
</p>

<p>
After the sessions you are asked to submit a fixed versions of the quizzes so
logging the session might be prudent.

<pre caption="Bugzilla setup comment">
What we did:
- LDAP
- bugzilla
- cvs/svn/git groups on cvs.gentoo.org
- IRC-cloak
- sent you your LDAP/mail password via encrypted mail
- announcement
- gentoo-core

What you need to do:
- subscribe to mailing lists with @gentoo.org address
- request forum status bump in #gentoo-forums or by mail to
  forum-mods@gentoo.org (if you have a forums count)
- send yourself mail to create .maildir
- add yourself to mail aliases ( like java@gentoo.org )
  see /var/mail/alias on dev.gentoo.org
- ask team leads to add yourself to herds.xml for the herds you want to
  join or do it yourself if you have the permission to do so
- set lat and lon attributes in LDAP if you want others to know where
  exactly you are located
- set gentooIM if you want people to be able to contact you via other
  means than email
- If you want a blog on blogs.gentoo.org, contact planet@gentoo.org

For the mentor:
- You are also responsible for the commits of your recruit during the first
  month so you should watch the commits of your recruit via gentoo-commits
  mailing list.

<title>Steps for adding a new developer</title>
<section>
<title>1. Adding the new developer to LDAP</title>
<body>

<p>
At first, start adding the new developer to LDAP. This requires you to
<c>ssh</c> to <c>dev.gentoo.org</c> and use the <c>perl_ldap</c> script
to create the new account.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the initial UID in LDAP">
# <i>ssh dev.gentoo.org</i>
# <i>perl_ldap -b user -c</i>
Enter LDAP Password:

LDAP Perl interface v1.0
[ou=devs] >> <i>A hyakuhei</i>
Adding LDAP user hyakuhei
Enter First Name: Robert
Enter Last Name: Clark
Enter LDAP Password:

done!
</pre>

<p>
Afterwards, the new developer should look like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Informations present in LDAP after addition">
[ou=devs] >> <i>s hyakuhei</i>
Searching...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
dn:uid=hyakuhei,ou=devs,dc=gentoo,dc=org

             uid: hyakuhei
              cn: Robert Clark
       givenName: Robert
              sn: Clark
    userPassword: {crypt}$1$HP/3wW0V$XUMrrFeQDHiMSGDOIUAbi/
shadowLastChange: 13520
       shadowMax: 99999
   shadowWarning: 15
      loginShell: /bin/bash
   homeDirectory: /home/hyakuhei
           gecos: Robert Clark
  shadowInactive: 15
    shadowExpire: 14883
       gidNumber: 100
       uidNumber: 2159
        birthday: undefined
  gentooLocation: undefined
     gentooRoles: undefined
      gentooJoin: 2007/01/07
            herd: undefined
    gentooStatus: active
          gpgkey: undefined
  gpgfingerprint: undefined
     objectClass: top
                  person
                  organizationalPerson
                  gentooDev
                  inetOrgPerson
                  posixAccount
                  shadowAccount
                  ldapPublicKey
</pre>

<p>
Next step is to fill the remaining informations needed, for example
<c>birthday</c>, <c>gentooLocation</c> and those others listed as
<c>undefined</c>.
Please be aware, that as of <b>17. December 2007</b>, all dates
in LDAP should be spelled in ISO8601, meaning like this: YYYY/MM/DD
(ie. 2007/12/18).
</p>

<pre caption="Updating the attribute gentooLocation">
[ou=devs] >> <i>u hyakuhei</i>
[hyakuhei, ou=devs] >> <i>M gentooLocation "Wales, UK"</i>
Modifying LDAP user hyakuhei
done!
</pre>

<p>
Same scheme applies to all those other <c>undefined</c> elements.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards it should look like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Completely filled informations">
[ou=devs] >> <i>s hyakuhei</i>
Searching...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
dn:uid=hyakuhei,ou=devs,dc=gentoo,dc=org

             uid: hyakuhei
              cn: Robert Clark
       givenName: Robert
              sn: Clark
    userPassword: {crypt}$1$HP/3wW0V$XUMrrFeQDHiMSGDOIUAbi/
shadowLastChange: 13520
       shadowMax: 99999
   shadowWarning: 15
      loginShell: /bin/bash
   homeDirectory: /home/hyakuhei
           gecos: Robert Clark
  shadowInactive: 15
    shadowExpire: 14883
       gidNumber: 100
       uidNumber: 2159
      gentooJoin: 2007/01/07
            herd: undefined
    gentooStatus: active
     objectClass: top
                  person
                  organizationalPerson
                  gentooDev
                  inetOrgPerson
                  posixAccount
                  shadowAccount
                  ldapPublicKey
  gentooLocation: Wales, UK

  gpgfingerprint: 4C01 D375 8AEF CB2D 3AED  3B2D 119C 7E35 2217 D168
</pre>

<p>
We then need to create the <c>sshPublicKey</c> attribute.
</p>

<p>
This first method requires the public ssh-key of the developer somewhere on
<c>dev.gentoo.org</c> in order to import it this way into LDAP.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the attribute sshPublicKey (file method)">
# <i>perl_ldap -b user -M sshPublicKey "$(&lt;hyakuhei.pub)" hyakuhei</i>
Modifying LDAP user hyakuhei
done!
</pre>

<p>
Another method assumes you'll copy and paste public ssh-key directly into
command line. For readability we had to split very long public key but, of
course, you don't need to split it and you can paste everything in one line.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the attribute sshPublicKey (copy+paste method)">
[hyakuhei, ou=devs] >> <i>C sshPublicKey "ssh-dss \

ebq/LMMTQV0Sq2wbDc7g9Jkxr4apAGDIM= hyakuhei@gentoo.org"</i>
Modifying LDAP user hyakuhei
done!
</pre>

<p>
We also need to add an external, i.e. non-<c>@gentoo.org</c>, email address. It
can be done with the exact same two methods as for the attribute sshPublicKey
above. For example:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding an external email address.">
[hyakuhei, ou=devs] >> <i>C mail "joe.dev@mydomain.com"</i>
Modifying LDAP user hyakuhei
done!
</pre>

<p>
We are done now with adding the developer to LDAP, lets quit now.
</p>

<pre caption="Quitting">
[hyakuhei, ou=devs] >> <i>quit</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>2. Setting up the developer's gentooAccess</title>
<body>

<p>
In preparation of granting access to cvs/svn/git, the gentoo-core
mailing list or changing his bugzilla login name, you will need to poke one of
the leads to setup the developer's <c>gentooAccess</c>. This is needed,
otherwise he/she won't be able to login to the machines we use in the
development process (dev.gentoo.org and cvs.gentoo.org for example).
</p>

<p>
After a senior devrel member added the <c>gentooAccess</c> portion, you can go
ahead with the next steps.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>3. Granting svn/cvs/git access</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to grant access to cvs/svn/git to the newly added developer, you will need
to <c>ssh</c> to <c>stork.gentoo.org</c> and add the username to the appropriate
groups.
</p>

<pre caption="Adding a developer to the groups cvs, svn and git">
# <i>ssh stork.gentoo.org</i>
# <i>gpasswd -a hyakuhei cvs</i>
Adding user hyakuhei to group cvs
# <i>gpasswd -a hyakuhei svn</i>
Adding user hyakuhei to group svn
# <i>gpasswd -a hyakuhei git</i>
Adding user hyakuhei to group git
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>4. Creating the developer's account on dev.gentoo.org</title>
<body>

<p>
Now get the developer to <c>ssh</c> to <c>dev.gentoo.org</c> as the first login
will trigger the creation of his account.
</p>

<note>
Try handing the dev-to-be the full commandline like
<c>ssh hyakuhei@dev.gentoo.org</c>, in order to minimize mistakes and/or
misconfigurations.
</note>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>5. Changing the developer's bugzilla login</title>
<body>

<p>
After the developer logged in successfully, you can proceed with the recruiter
process. Login to bugzilla, choose <c>Users</c> in the Row <b>Edit</b>.
Supplement the developer's current email adress (the one he used for bugzilla).
</p>

<p>
Change his current <c>Login name</c> to read <b>handle-name@gentoo.org</b> (in
the present case that is <b>hyakuhei@gentoo.org</b>). Hit <c>Update</c> once
you're finished with the modifications.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>6. Subscribing the developer to gentoo-core</title>
<body>

<p>
	Every developer needs to be subscribed to gentoo-core and gentoo-dev-announce.
	gentoo-core is the only gentoo mailing list only infra members can subscribe/remove other devs.
</p>
<p>
	You need to ping infra members on <c>#gentoo-infra</c> and if you don't get an immediate
	response then Cc them to the developer bug.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>7. Giving the developer operator status in #gentoo-dev</title>
<body>

<p>
Every developer gets operator status (+o) in <c>#gentoo-dev</c>. In order to do
that, you'll have to use FreeNode's ChanServ. Use the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding the developer to ChanServ's access list">
[(status)] <i>/msg ChanServ access #gentoo-dev add hyakuhei +vVOriRA</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will see him getting <b>+o</b> by ChanServ. In order to make sure, the
<c>AUTOOP</c> is working, kick the new developer from <c>#gentoo-dev</c> and
wait till he rejoins. If everything is working as it should, he will get the
<b>+o</b> on join by ChanServ.
</p>

<p>
If you want to automatically give voice status (+v) in <c>#gentoo-dev</c> to a
recruit, e.g. during his/her mentoring period, use the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding the developer to ChanServ's access list">
[(status)] <i>/msg ChanServ access #gentoo-dev add hyakuhei +ViA</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>8. Introducing the developer on gentoo-dev</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to announce the new developer, you as recruiter have the honour to
introduce him to the developer community. Write a brief introduction containing
some details about your recruitee.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Remaining tasks</title>
<body>

<p>
Please follow up with the developer during their first month to make sure they
are adapting well and to address any concerns.
