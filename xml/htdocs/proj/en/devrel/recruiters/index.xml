	<longdescription>
	Gentoo's true strength is its impressive and constantly evolving developer base. It's the job of recruiters to manage the growth of the
	development team by locating, approving, and managing new developers to add further innovative talent to our already strong organization.

	<title>What does it take to be a recruiter?</title>
	<section>
	<body>
	<p>First and foremost, a recruiter needs to be a good judge of character. While most new developer sponsors pick only the best candidates,
	there have been and will be occassional duds. Recruiters need to be able to analyze an individual's background, experience, and past
	contributions, then use that information to decide whether or not to accept a developer. Remember, recruiters always have the final say
	on new developers. Never be afraid to say no, but always offer a detailed explanation of why you made that decision.

	<title>What does the recruitment process involve?</title>
	<section>
	<body>
	<p>First, an existing developer sponsors a new developer. The sponsor must be willing to be a mentor to the new developer.
	Mentors are responsible for pointing mentees to developer-related documentation, answering questions, explaining the ins and outs of
	working for Gentoo as much as possible, and assisting/supporting the new developer even past the required two week training period.
	A new developer bug must be filed by the sponsor or a recruiter. An experienced recruiter can point out excellent examples of new
	developer bugs giving all the relevant information.
	</p>
	<p>A two week probationary period for training and review begins when the new developer bug is filed, assuming it is not rejected by
	recruiters. The mentor should be in regular contact with their mentee to regularly review their work and offer suggestions and constructive
	criticism. Please note that two weeks is the absolute required minimum, but definitely not the maximum. Mentors and recruiters should both be
	confident in the new developer before proceeding.
	</p>
	<p>At the end of the two week period, a <uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~avenj/quiz">questionnaire</uri> should be filled out by the mentee.
	This is not a pass/fail examination by any means. The questionnaire is intended to make sure new developers carefully read both developer policy and technical documentation.
	This should be emailed to <mail link="recruiters@gentoo.org">recruiters@gentoo.org</mail> along with a scanned 
	<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/copyright-assignment.xml">copyright assignment</uri> agreement and a SSH DSA public key.
	When recruiters and the mentor both agree that a new developer is ready and all the relevant information has been received, access to Gentoo infrastructure is granted.

	<title>Checklist for adding a new developer</title>
	<section>
	<body>
	<p>First make sure that the person has op status in #gentoo-dev.
	Please let seemant, avenj, rac, spyderous, or cybersystem know, so that
	they can make this happen.</p>
	<p>Next make sure to add the developer's account to dev.gentoo.org
	(emu).  In order to do this, first check /etc/passwd for the last
	<b>developer</b> account.  Please note that other types of accounts
	exist and they have UIDs in different ranges.  Next, run: sudo
	/usr/sbin/superadduser.  For the UID, make it 1+the last one you saw.
	The rest is just defaults.  Set a password so that the user can login
	and change it.  After that make sure you have their key and do: sudo
	/usr/bin/vim /home/new_developer/.ssh/authorized_keys and paste their
	key there. Have them confirm that they can login via ssh.  Troubleshoot
	by making sure the ssh key you input is correct.  At this point, they
	should be told to change their password from the one you assigned, and
	then pointed to the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/dev-email.xml">
	developer email howto</uri> to set up email.</p>
	<p>If they will be needing cvs priveleges to the portage tree, ping
	avenj, seemant or spyderous.  If you have the permissions to do it,
	login to the cvs box and run: sudo /usr/sbin/superadduser and give them
	the same UID as on the dev box, if it's available.  Also make sure to
	add them to the cvs group (and leave them in the default users
	group).</p>
	<p>Now, ping dmwaters or sj7trunks or klieber to subscribe them to
	-core mailing list. Additionally, if they are presently subscribed to
	any gentoo mailing lists, they should unsubscribe and resubscribe with
	their gentoo address.</p>
	<p>Next up, you want to edit their current bugzilla login and change it
	to their gentoo account.  While you're in there, make sure their real
	name is in the Name field.  <b>Do not change their bugzilla
	password.</b></p>
	<p>Now, ping rac or brandy or one of the other forums administrators to
	update their status on the <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo
	Forums.</uri></p>
	<p>Finally, send an email to the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">gentoo-dev mailing listx.</uri>
	to introduce them to the developer and user community.  In your
	introduction, you may be funny, as that seems to be the normal way to
	introduce a developer, but please explicitly state their reason for
	being a developer (primary herds, other gentoo related projects, etc).
	</p>
	<p> Please follow up with the developer during their first month to
	make sure they are getting along, staying off the drugs, etc.</p>
