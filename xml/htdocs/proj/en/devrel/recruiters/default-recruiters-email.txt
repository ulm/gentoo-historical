Thanks for your interest.

We are very actively looking for interested people. You can start contributing right now if you want. Two good ways to start are proposing solutions for bugs [1] and contributing to an overlay [2] be it a general overlay like Sunrise[3] or project specific overlays like KDE[4], GNOME[5] or Science[6]. There is more information on how to get involved with overlay development at [7]. You may also want to have a look at the staffing needs page [8].

If you have written ebuilds, feel free to submit them to bugzilla [1] or sunrise [3]. This way we can all see them and help you make them better. Also, you never know, some developer may like what you did and commit it to the main tree. Note that we're all very busy so we may not react to your bugs, but that should not prevent you from filing them. Bugzilla is also used for documenting work that needs to be done and following up on it, so if the bugs sit there even if nobody reacts it's already useful.

You will need to read the Gentoo Documentation Resources [9], and more specifically the Gentoo Developer Handbook [10] and the Gentoo Development Guide [11].

Another way to help, especially for non-technical projects, is to contact people directly [12]. Be aware that they can be away though, so be patient, try others on the same project, and finally get back to us in case you fail to reach anybody. You may also want to look at what mailing lists are of interest to you [13] and browse through the archives [14] to learn what is going on.

Training new developers takes a lot of time and effort so we don't recruit as much as we would like and need. Before you can enter the recruiting process though, you'll need to show what you can do. We do this for many reasons but mainly because it shows your commitment to Gentoo (since training takes so much time we favor people who we know will stay), it shows what your interests are (you'll need to find a mentor with the same interests to start your training) and it tells us how much and what kind of training you need.

So, start filing and more importantly fixing bugs, submit ebuilds, be active on our irc channels and mailing lists, and at some point you'll get noticed. When a developer notices you, (s)he may ask you to join an arch testing team, an herd or offer to mentor you. When you think your work is significant enough and you find out that nobody notices you when they should be, feel free to contact us again and we'll try and arrange the situation.

Are there any particular areas that interest you? Have you tried to join any project's irc channels[15]? Sometimes the best way to get a mentor is through direct contact with devs - be it through bugzilla, mls or irc.

Do not hesitate to contact recruiters in the future in case you need more information.
