<description>Planet Gentoo provides a central aggregation of developers' blogs, to keep users
and other developers informed of what they are working on</description>

<longdescription>
<p>For a long time, users have been asking for a better way to find out about what developers
are working on within Gentoo, and developers have been wanting a way to communicate with the
user and developer communities. Planet Gentoo aims to provide a partial solution to both of
these, by aggregating developers' weblogs in one place.</p>

<p>This aggregation is currently available in two forms. Planet Gentoo shows only posts marked
as 'on-topic', and related to Gentoo development. Gentoo Universe shows all posts to that
developer's blog, for those who are interested in more than strictly Gentoo-related news.</p>
