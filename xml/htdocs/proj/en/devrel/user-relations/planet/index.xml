<description>Planet Gentoo provides a central aggregation of developers' blogs, to keep users
and other developers informed of what they are working on</description>

<longdescription>
<p>For a long time, users have been asking for a better way to find out about what developers
are working on within Gentoo, and developers have been wanting a way to communicate with the
user and developer communities. Planet Gentoo aims to provide a partial solution to both of
these, by aggregating developers' weblogs in one place.</p>

<p>This aggregation is currently available in two forms. Planet Gentoo shows only posts marked
as 'on-topic', and related to Gentoo development. Gentoo Universe shows all posts to that
developer's blog, for those who are interested in more than strictly Gentoo-related news.</p>

<p>Planet Gentoo and Gentoo Universe can display an icon or headshot of the developer on the website, and submissions are encouraged.  We enjoy being able to put a name to the face of our bloggers.</p>

<p>See the <uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackergotchi">Wikipedia entry</uri> for more information and links on how to create your own.  Send your image in an e-mail to one of the Planet Gentoo admins when finished.</p>

<p>If you are not interested in making one yourself, you can write an entry in your blog including a photo and request that someone make one for you.</p>
