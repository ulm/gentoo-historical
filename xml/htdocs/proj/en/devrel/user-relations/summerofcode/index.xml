<description>
The Gentoo Summer of Code subproject oversees Gentoo's participation in the
2006 Google Summer of Code.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>For the second year running, Google is organising a <e>Summer of Code</e>,
funding students to work on open-source projects over the summer. For more
details, see <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/">the official SoC
website</uri>.</p>
<p>This year, Gentoo is participating as a mentor organisation. As a result,
we hope to see several students working on specific projects with Gentoo over
the summer, and hopefully becoming more involved long-term in Gentoo 
development.</p>

<title>Project Ideas</title>
<section>
<body>
    <p>Here is a list of some of the project ideas:</p>    
        <table>
	    <tr>
		<th>Idea</th>
		<th>Details</th>
	    </tr>

            <tr>
	    <ti>Rewrite of repoman</ti>
            <ti>Repoman is a tool used by gentoo
                    developers for Quality Assurance and commits to the tree.
                    As it is now, additional checks are hard to implement into
                    the application. Seeking a modular rewrite preferably in
                    python but other languages are possible</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
	    	<ti>WYSIWYG editor for guidexml</ti>
            	<ti>Entails writing a graphical front-end so that people who
                    do not necessarily know GuideXML can create compliant XML.
                    Might consist of either a web based frontend or a client
                    application based frontend.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>gentoolkit rewrite</ti>
		<ti>gentoolkit is a set of tools that can be used to query portage
		about information that pertains to your system and what is installed.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Port "sandbox" to other platforms</ti>
            	<ti>Perhaps get sandbox functioning on Alpha, ARM, MIPS, or
                    PowerPC</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Write a configuration file manager (etc-update
                    replacement)</ti>
		<ti>Configuration file management on Gentoo is still a pain and could use a
		redesign with regards to how file updates are managed.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>GLEP 42 implementation</ti>
            	<ti>This GLEP would entail modifying portage to allow for critical news reports.
		For more information please read the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0042.html">GLEP</uri></ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Graphical frontend to baselayout</ti>
		<ti>Gentoo has a wondering Baselayout package that allows for all kinds of intersting
		networking configurations.  A GUI front-end to it would be beneficial to the community.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Modify Java Packages to build with an open source
                        JVM</ti>
                <ti>Patch packages that use proprietary classes while
                        working with upstream. Over three hundred packages
                        would need to be modified. This would allow platforms
                        that are not necessarily supported by a proprietary
                        JVM to run Java applications such as Eclipse and
                        Azureus.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Rewrite backend for NetworkManager</ti>
                <ti>Would possibly include adding Avahi support, Dialup/Modem support, or
                        Reading settings from baselayout</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Work on "Gentoo-Stats"</ti>
		<ti>This project would allow arch teams to know how much testing 
		each package gets and it would let developers know about what types 
		of CFLAGS/USE flags our users are utilising</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	    	<ti>Gentoo/*BSD projects</ti>
		<ti>The Gentoo/*BSD project, while maturing quickly, still needs a lot of work
		in several areas. Useful project ideas include: catalyst support for building
		*BSD stages and livecds, porting Sandbox to work on BSD systems, better support
		for BSD file flags in Portage, Gnome porting (running GNOME on FreeBSD requires 
		a large collection of patches from the Ports collection; this project would clean
		these up, make them more generic, and attempt to send them upstream so that others
		can benefit), and potentially modifying alsa-lib to use FreeBSD's OSS system as
		a sound backend, so that applications written to use ALSA can work unmodified on
		FreeBSD. Also useful would be to port Gentoo/FreeBSD to AMD64, and potentially
		other, hardware, sorting out any architecture issues that may crop up, such as
		building a proper multilib toolchain.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>GLEP 27 Implementation</ti>
		<ti>Provide an implementation of <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0027.html">
		GLEP 27</uri> in which ebuilds may add and remove necessary accounts in a variety
		of environments.  At present only <path>/etc/passwd</path> is support.  Adding support
		for LDAP and NIS/NIS+ environments would increase the usefulness of the Portage system.
		</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Scire project - Systems Configuration, Installation, and Replication Environment</ti>
		<ti>Scire is a new project in Gentoo that aims to install, configure, and replicate
		gentoo installations onto numerous machines.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Kernel Level Sandbox</ti>
		<ti>Write a kernel module that performs similar sandboxing that the current sandbox
		application does.  The kernel level sandbox is harder to fool, compared to the userland
		sandbox that is currently used.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Tree Builder</ti>
		<ti>Create an application that takes a stock portage tree and molds it to fit certain needs.
		For example, the application could remove Xorg and all ebuilds that depend on it.  This would
		be like stripping packages from the tree.  One could also envision a scenario where the
		program is given a set of packages and builds a tree with only those packages and their
		dependencies ( recursively ) in it.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Bugs Everywhere Bug Tracker Improvements</ti>
		<ti>Basically allow developers to comment on specific lines in a program.  Implement
		so that the tracker also tracks line and function moves such that developers do not have
		to repost their comments.  Security developers can then note potential problems in code	
		and review them.</ti>
