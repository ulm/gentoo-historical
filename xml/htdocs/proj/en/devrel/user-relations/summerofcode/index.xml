The Gentoo Summer of Code subproject oversees Gentoo's participation in the
2006 Google Summer of Code.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>Thank you for showing interest in Gentoo. Gentoo is a great place to spend the summer learning,
coding, participating and contributing. We're an exciting Linux distrubution with a vibrant community
and look forward to your application and your project ideas.</p>

<p>For the second year running, Google is organising a 
<uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</uri>, funding students
to work on open-source projects over the summer. This year, Gentoo is participating
as a mentoring organisation.</p>

<title>Project Ideas</title>
<section>
<body>
    <p>Here is a list of some of the project ideas:</p>    
        <table>
	    <tr>
		<th>Idea</th>
		<th>Details</th>
	    </tr>

            <tr>
	    <ti>Rewrite of repoman</ti>
            <ti>Repoman is a tool used by Gentoo
                    developers for quality assurance and commits to the tree.
                    Additional checks are hard to implement. Seeking a modular
                    rewrite, preferably in Python but other languages are
                    possible.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
	    	<ti>WYSIWYG editor for GuideXML</ti>
            	<ti>Entails writing a graphical front-end so that people who
                    do not necessarily know GuideXML can create compliant XML.
                    Might consist of either a Web-based front-end or a client
                    application-based front-end.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Write a configuration file manager (etc-update
                    replacement)</ti>
		<ti>Configuration file management on Gentoo is still a pain and could use a
		redesign with regards to how file updates are managed.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>GLEP 42 implementation</ti>
            	<ti>This GLEP would entail modifying portage to allow for critical news reports.
		For more information please read the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0042.html">GLEP</uri>.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Graphical frontend to baselayout</ti>
		<ti>Gentoo has a wonderful baselayout package that allows for all kinds of interesting
		networking configurations.  A GUI front-end to it would be beneficial to the community.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Use Open Source JVMs to build Java packages
                      </ti>
                <ti>Patch packages that use proprietary classes while
                        working with upstream. Over 300 packages
                        need to be modified. This would allow platforms
                        that are not necessarily supported by a proprietary
                        JVM to run Java applications such as Eclipse and
                        Azureus.</ti>
	    </tr>
            <tr>
		<ti>Rewrite back-end for NetworkManager</ti>
                <ti>Would possibly include adding Avahi support, dialup/modem support, or
                        reading settings from baselayout</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Work on "Gentoo-Stats"</ti>
		<ti>This project would allow arch teams to know how much testing 
		each package gets, and it would let developers know what types 
		of CFLAGS/USE flags our users are utilising</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	    	<ti>Gentoo/*BSD projects</ti>
		<ti>The Gentoo/*BSD project, while maturing quickly, still needs a lot of work
		in several areas. Useful project ideas include: catalyst support for building
		*BSD stages and LiveCDs, porting Sandbox to work on BSD systems, better support
		for BSD file flags in Portage, Gnome porting (running GNOME on FreeBSD requires 
		a large collection of patches from the Ports collection; this project would clean
		these up, make them more generic, and attempt to send them upstream so that others
		can benefit), and potentially modifying alsa-lib to use FreeBSD's OSS system as
		a sound backend, so that applications written to use ALSA can work unmodified on
		FreeBSD. Also useful would be to port Gentoo/FreeBSD to AMD64, and potentially
		other hardware, sorting out any architecture issues that may crop up, such as
		building a proper multilib toolchain.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>GLEP 27 Implementation</ti>
		<ti>Provide an implementation of <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0027.html">
		GLEP 27</uri> in which ebuilds may add and remove necessary accounts in a variety
		of environments.  At present only <path>/etc/passwd</path> is supported.  Adding support
		for LDAP and NIS/NIS+ environments would increase the usefulness of the Portage system.
		Potential exists to combine with this a solution for 
		<uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5113">Bug #5113</uri> by providing
		a more generic framework and using it for both applications. Also note that the
		superadduser script exists and is well-known, so it could be used as a base for this.
		</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Scire project - Systems Configuration, Installation, and Replication Environment</ti>
		<ti><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/scire/index.xml">Scire</uri> is a new project in Gentoo that aims to install, configure, and replicate
		Gentoo installations onto numerous machines.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Kernel-level Sandbox</ti>
		<ti>Write a kernel module that performs similar sandboxing to what the current Sandbox
		application does.  The kernel-level sandbox would provide more control over the build environment,
 		compared to the current userland sandbox.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Tree Builder</ti>
		<ti>Create an application that takes a stock Portage tree and molds it to fit certain needs.
		This involves isolating portions of an existing tree to produce subsets that fill
		certain niches.  An example would be a tree of packages that contain only server-related
		packages ( IE no X ).  
		</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Bugs Everywhere Bug Tracker Improvements</ti>
		<ti>Basically allow developers to comment on specific lines in a program.  Implement
		so that the tracker also tracks line and function moves such that developers do not have
		to repost their comments.  Security developers can then note potential problems in code	
		and review them.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	    	<ti>Improve jack support across media-{video,sound} packages, and possibly add support
		for the polypaudio framework</ti>
		<ti>Improve support for jack in our sound and video packages. This would involve adding
		and/or revamping ebuilds for various applications that can support it, making sure that
		we provide appropriate kernels, and patching applications that do not yet support it.
		For polipaudio, support would require including the current daemon in Portage, and 
		patching ebuilds to enable support for it in all applications that can use it.</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Migrate gentoo-x86 from CVS</ti>
		<ti>Gentoo has been using CVS for quite some time. Many developers, however, look to
		move to a different version control system (VCS).  Prospective proposals should include reasons
		for the move as well as a test migration and use period.
		</ti>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<ti>Paludis projects</ti>
		<ti>The Paludis package manager aims to provide an alternative to Portage that supports
		the same ebuild format. The project is still in its infancy, and is missing a few desirable
		features. Possible projects would include writing a release building tool, somewhat akin to
		catalyst, that uses the Paludis libraries for building, and support for other repository formats
		than Gentoo's, such as CPAN.</ti>

<title>Tips for prospective students</title>
<body>

<p>Please try not to overbook yourself. Make working on
your Gentoo project your main activity for the entire summer. We will
also ask of you that you are willing to provide weekly status reports.
The main priority should be time as you will have a lot to learn about the
project before you are ready to begin coding, and none of our projects are
particularly simple. In return, we will provide you with excellent support 
from the mentors and the rest of the Gentoo community. Maintaining the
focus to work on your Gentoo project, however, will be your responsibility.</p>

<p>When writing your proposal, keep in mind that we are likely to receive
many applications and competition will be fierce. If you want your application
to get serious consideration, ensure that you do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Sell your idea</b> &#8212; Describe your idea in detail. What is the ultimate
goal? What components will it have? What are the benefits to Gentoo and
to our community? How do you plan to achieve completion of your project?
If a specification already exists, what will you do that will go above
and beyond all expectations?</li>

<li><b>Sell yourself</b> &#8212; Make sure you get across just how enthusiastic you are
about the project. Tell us what makes you stand out from the rest of the
crowd. Talk about your past experiences and what makes you think. Why are
you interested in OSS and Gentoo in particular? What interests do you
have, and how do these relate to the project for which you are applying?
There is a basic assumption that people applying for Summer of Code will
have at least some programming skills already, so rather than spending a
lot of time elaborating on these (though by all means, tell us what you
know), spend time talking about you.</li>

<li><b>Be enthusiastic</b> &#8212; Summer of Code is a very exciting opportunity, and
Gentoo is a incredibly exciting project to work on. We're not just
looking for someone who wants a summer job to pass their time, we want
people who have a passion for open source and who are (or will become)
enthusiastic Gentoo contributors.</li>

<li><b>Tailor your application to the project</b> &#8212; Ensure that your application
is targeted and tailored toward us and the specific project for which
you are applying. It will be easy to tell if your application is too generic.</li>

<li><b>Get feedback</b> &#8212; Come and discuss your idea with some established
Gentoo developers. You can find us in #gentoo-soc on irc.freenode.net, or
you may sign up for the Gentoo Summer of Code mailing list by sending an empty
e-mail to gentoo-soc+subscribe@gentoo.org. Run your idea by us. We don't
want to waste your time, and we can inform you whether a proposal is worth
writing. We would likely reject an idea that duplicates
existing efforts or code (should it not provide a very convincing reason
for doing so), so check with people to make sure that your proposal is 
original enough. See whether you can find someone to review your application
before you submit it, be it the mentor for that particular project (in
the case of applying for a project already listed on our ideas page) or
someone with expertise in a particular area. Don't be afraid to ask the
community for help; we want you to succeed just as much as you do.</li>

<li><b>Don't be afraid</b> &#8212; Do you have a brilliant idea not 
covered by the proposals on the ideas pages? Excellent! Don't be afraid
to think 'outside the box' and come up with a fantastic idea of your
own. We'd love to hear it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Need more of an idea about how to write your proposal? Check out
<uri>http://summerofcode.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ExampleApplications</uri>,
which contains some examples of accepted proposals from last year's Summer of
Code.</p>

<p>Student applications are now open, and proposals are due by May 8. Applications
will be decided upon, and those that are accepted matched up with mentors, by May 22.
If you would like to apply as a student, please go to 
<uri>http://code.google.com/soc/student_step1.html</uri> to submit your application.</p>

<p>Parts of the above were adapted from <uri link="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</uri>,
and we thank them for allowing us to use their experiences from last year to our
benefit this year.</p>
