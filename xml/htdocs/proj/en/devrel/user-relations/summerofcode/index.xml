    The Gentoo Summer of Code subproject manages the gentoo application to the
    2006 google Summer of Code.
</description>

<longdescription>
    <p>For the second year, google organizes a <e>Summer of Code</e>, paying
        students to work on an open-source projects over the summer. For more
        details, see <uri link="http://code.google.com/soc/">the official SoC
            website</uri>.</p>
    <p>Unlike last year, gentoo is now participating as a mentor organization.
        That means that we should have some students working on specific parts
        of gentoo, and hopefully becoming more and more involved in gentoo
        development.</p>

    <p><b>As a student</b>: According to the <uri
            link="http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html">Student
            FAQ</uri>, you should submit a project application between May 1st
        and May 8th. It is adviced to pick up one of the project ideas on this
        page, though if you have an outstanding idea which we hadn't thought
        of, this would also be ok. It is also adviced to have a solid
        knowledge of gentoo before applying.</p>
