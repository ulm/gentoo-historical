Revision 1.0 - 24 August 2004
Answer in whatever length necessary for completeness.
Review documentation. Consult your mentor if you're unable to locate answers.
Portions of this quiz extracted from ciaranm's bash quiz 
(http://dev.gentoo.org/~ciaranm/docs/bash-quiz.txt)

1. You are writing an ebuild for the foomatic package. Upstream calls 
	the current version "1.3-7b" (but this is _not_ a beta release).
	How would the ebuild be named? What's wrong with the ebuild
	snippet below and how should this be written to aid
	maintainability?

  SRC_URI="http://foomatic.example.com/download/foomatic-1.3-7b.tar.bz2"
  S=${WORKDIR}/foomatic-1.3-7b

2. You have a patch for foomatic which enables SSL support. Give an
	example src_unpack() which will apply this patch if and only if
	the "ssl" USE flag is enabled. What three other things must be
	added to the ebuild?

3. What's the difference between local and global scope in an ebuild?

4. Why should an external application (for example sed/grep) not be
	called in global scope? What alternative methods can be used?

5. What is wrong with using $(somecommand) or `somecommand` or $ARCH
	inside SRC_URI, DEPEND, etc?

6. Explain what's wrong with the following code snippets and suggest
	an alternative.

6.a
  # This ebuild doesn't like the -mcpu=ultrasparc CFLAG, so drop to v9
  CFLAGS=${CFLAGS/-mcpu=ultrasparc/-mcpu=v9}

6.b
  # Upstream don't support user-specified CFLAGS
  unset CFLAGS

6.c
  # Extra settings for when SSL is enabled
  if [ "`use ssl `" ] ; then
	# blah
  fi

6.d
  # Extra options for configure
  use jpeg && myconf="--enable-jpeg" \
	|| myconf="--disable-jpeg"
  use png && myconf="${myconf} --enable-png" \
	|| myconf="${myconf} --disable-png"
  use gif && myconf="${myconf} --enable-gif89a" \
	|| myconf="${myconf} --disable-gif89a"
  econf ${myconf}

6.e
  # Depend upon the relevant GTK+ version
  DEPEND="gtk2? ( >=x11-libs/gtk+-2.2 ) : ( =x11-libs/gtk+-1.2* )"

6.f
  # If we USE foo, we need to DEPEND upon libfoo. Not available on some
  # archs though.
  DEPEND="!x86? ( !amd64? ( !ppc? ( foo? ( >=dev-libs/libfoo-1.2 ) ) ) )"

7. Explain briefly the purpose of the following tools:
	grep, cut, sed, cat, wc, scp

8. Why are 'head -5' and 'tail -5' bad? What should be used instead?
