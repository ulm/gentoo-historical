	<description>Gentoo policy on licenses and copyrights</description>
	<longdescription>
		<p>Our project receives contributions from many people
		from all over the world.  Some of these contributions
		come from our own volunteer developers. Others come
		from users, or from large organizations like
		universities and businesses. These contributions form a
		community-developed work called Gentoo. Gentoo code is
		released under the GNU General Public License, and our
		documentation is released under the Creative Commons
		Attribution Share-Alike (CC-AS) license.</p>
		
		<p>Our code repository also contains many build scripts
		called "ebuilds." As a whole, our repository of ebuild
		scripts can be used to build an entire operating system
		that we call Gentoo Linux. It's important to note that
		while the ebuilds contain the knowledge necessary to
		build this operating system, the operating system
		itself is composed of freely-available parts that are
		generally not authored by the Gentoo development
		community, nor considered part of our repository of
		code. The primary focus of Gentoo is to create the
		tools, automation and knowledge necessary to integrate
		these freely-available parts into a working operating
		system. The works created by the Gentoo community are
		generally focused on the complex task of integrating
		the various freely-available parts into a working
		whole.  </p>
		
		<p>Sometimes, we either create or receive contributed
		"patches" for these freely-available parts, to either
		enhance their functionality, fix a bug, or for some
		other purpose. These patches are generally made
		available to the public under the license of the parent
		program. For example, for a non-Gentoo program that is
		released under the BSD license, a patch that we create
		for this program would be released by us under the same
		license of the parent program -- the BSD license. This
		is a commonly-accepted practice in the free software
		and "open source" community, as it allows patches to be
		integrated into the parent program's official source code
		without complication, if the authors of the parent program
		so desire. This practice allows free software to benefit
		from the improvements of others.</p>
		
		<p>Sometimes, individuals and organizations may use
		Gentoo code in ways that may violate the GNU General
		Public License or the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
		license. In such a situation, steps need to be taken to
		correct this misuse of Gentoo code. These steps could
		conceivably involve legal action.</p>

		<p>If legal action is required, it is very beneficial if
		the code that is being used improperly is owned by as
		few entities as possible. This is a benefit because 
		all owners of the code in question must
		be a party in any legal action. Because we have hundreds of
		contributors to our project, it can create a logistical
		nightmare for our community project if many people own
		the code in question. Consider the effort required
		if the code in question consists of contributions from
		tens, possibly hundreds of people, who are from all parts
		of the globe, and who may or may not
		be currently active in Gentoo development or even able to
		be successfully contacted or tracked down.</p>

		<p>It's important for our community to be
		able to protect against misuse of our code. The best way to
		do this is to, as much as reasonably possible, assign copyrights
		of all contributed code to a single entity. This way, any
		violations of the licensing terms of Gentoo code can be addressed
		as quickly, efficiently and inexpensively as possible. In addition,
		this single entity should be bound to protect and preserve
		the original licensing terms of the code.</p>

		<p>Thus, we require all individual contributors to Gentoo
		to assign copyright for their contributed works to Gentoo
		Foundation, Inc. by signing a copyright assignment agreement.
		In order to ensure that the licensing terms of your assigned works
		are protected and preserved by Gentoo Foundation, Inc.,
		this copyright assignment agreement also contains a
		legally-binding commitment from Gentoo Technologies, Inc. that
		the assigned works will continue to remain available under
		licenses that are not materially different from the GNU General
		Public License and CC-SA Licenses under which they were
		originally released. This terminology will allow Gentoo
		Technologies, Inc. to "upgrade" to improved versions of these
		licenses as they become available, such as GPL version 3,
		but will not allow Gentoo Technologies, Inc. to
		release the assigned works under licenses that do not embody 
		identical principles as the licenses under which they were
		originally released. This commitment from Gentoo
		Technologies, Inc. also applies to any entities who may receive
		ownership of the the works in the future, such as the
		not-for-profit successor to Gentoo Technologies, Inc. Because
		of this commitment, you can know that your assigned
		works will continue to be available under licensing terms that
		you fully support, and under no other terms.</p>
			
		<p>To summarize: copyright assignment refers to the process
		of legally changing the ownership of intellectual property,
		such as a piece of code, to a new entity. In this case, it
		involves reassignment from contributors to the organization.
		This is a necessary step to ensure that Gentoo is legally able
		to pursue and defend against litigation. Towards this end, it
		is necessary to obtain signed copyright assignment from
		individual contributors. The signed document does two things:
		it turns copyright over to Gentoo Technologies, Inc.,
		and in return it guarantees that the contributed works will never
		be relicensed under a license materially different from the GNU
		General Public License (or, in the case of documentation,
		the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License). This allows
		the Gentoo community to take action to correct those who
		may knowingly or unknowingly violate the licensing terms of our works,
		while also ensuring that these works continue to be available under
		licensing terms that you fully support -- even when the ownership of
		these works are eventually transferred to another entity.

	<title>FAQ</title>
	<section>
		<body>
		<p><b>Q: I don't like the copyright agreement. What should I do?</b></p>
		<p>A: First, read this entire page, particularly this FAQ to make sure
		you are up to speed on all possible options for developers. If you
		still don't feel comfortable with some aspect of the copyright plan,
		quietly grumbling and being unhappy about it is not an acceptable
		option -- let your voice be heard!  Email the trustees 
		(<mail link="trustees@gentoo.org">Gentoo trustees</mail>), outline your
		concerns, and I'll get them addressed. Our copyright plan has
		benefitted tremendously from the input of developers. We want to do
		what will best serve Gentoo and its developers and users. That means
		keeping you happy.</p>


		<p><b>Q: Can you go into more detail on how the copyrights of patches
		should be treated?</b></p>
					
		<p>A: We recommend that you release the patch under the license of
		the program you are patching, unless your patch effectively
		rewrites a large portion of the program, in which case it may be
		possible to consider releasing the patched version of the software
		as a derivative work, and potentially under another license such as
		the GPL. If your patch is trivial in nature, or less than a page and
		not a "significant" work (which can be subjective,) normally the
		patch writer will not insist on having his or her name in the
		copyright notice of the parent program if the patch is accepted
		upstream. 
		</p>


		<p><b>Q: I've written a patch for a program that's included in Gentoo,
		and I need to add this patch to an ebuild. But I want to retain
		ownership of this patch. What should I do?</b></p>
			
		<p>A: It is possible to retain ownership of a patch that you wrote,
		even if it will be used in Gentoo to patch a third-party program.
		Here's how.  Simply do not commit it to our Portage tree or to any
		other place on Gentoo CVS, and do not send it to
		<mail link="submissions@gentoo.org">submissions@gentoo.org</mail> nor
		paste it into a bugzilla comment or upload it to bugzilla as an
		attachment. Instead, place it on a Gentoo or non-Gentoo server
		(<path>http://dev.gentoo.org/~devname/</path> is fine,) and specify
		this location in the <c>SRC_URI</c> of the ebuild. Then use
		<c>epatch</c> in the ebuild to apply your patch to the program.
		You should also of course include an appropriate copyright notice
		in your patch.  Your patch will then be included in Gentoo, and will
		show up on Gentoo mirrors, but will be owned by you. </p>


		<p><b>Q: I've written some software and want to make an ebuild for
		it. I'm OK with assigning the copyright for the ebuild, but I
		definitely do not want to assign the copyright for the software
		itself. What should I do?</b></p>

		<p>A: This too is do-able. What you should do is maintain your
		software on non-Gentoo servers, to avoid any confusion. You should
		specify a download location for your software in an ebuild using
		the <c>SRC_URI</c> variable. You can even store archives of your
		software in your own personal Web space at
		<path>http://dev.gentoo.org/~devname/</path>. But make sure you
		do not commit your software to our Portage tree, or to any Gentoo
		CVS server. Keep it on your own personal server, or on sourceforge,
		savannah, etc. And of course, be sure not to submit your software to 
		<path>submissions@gentoo.org</path>, or include it as an attachment
		on our bug tracker.  This way, the "Work" description of the copyright
		assignment document will not apply to it.</p>


		<p><b>Q: I work for an organization that does not allow me to assign
		copyrights. What can I do?</b></p>

		<p>A: If your contributions are or are expected to be significant,
		we may allow your organization to retain the copyright of your
		submitted works, provided that the works are released under the GPL
		and CC:SA (for docs) and your organization gives us a full,
		royalty-free license to the work so that it can be included in
		Gentoo. This avenue is only open to universitites, larger development
		groups and other organizations that will be contributing a
		significant body of work to Gentoo, since we want to keep the number
		of owners of Gentoo-specific code to a minimum. Please contact us
		for more information.</p>
		

		<p><b>Q: I want to retain copyrights for all my work, but still
		contribute them to Gentoo.  What should I do?</b></p>

		<p>A: We hope that there is some option that has been outlined above
		that will work for you. If not, it may be possible for you to form a
		relationship with or establish a larger organization or developer
		group that could enter into a licensing agreeement with us. However,
		then you would need to assign the copyright for your works to this
		entity, and you would have to determine the acceptability of that.
		Possibly the best course of action would be to see if we can address
		the root cause for you not wanting to assign the copyright to Gentoo.
		If you consider your work a separate, independent program, then
		copyright assignment may not be necessary.  If you have any concerns,
		please contact us so we can try to find an acceptable solution.
		</p>
	

		<p><b>Q: Why is copyright assignment necessary?</b></p>

		<p>A: Copyright assignment ensures that Gentoo is capable of legally
		defending itself.  Without copyright ownership by a single entity,
		our involvement in litigation can become difficult to pursue.
		Additionally, these documents ensure that the integrity of contributed
		code will be protected (for example, the license will never be
		modified to be more restrictive, or expanded to allow other licensing
		approaches).</p>

		<p><b>Q: What is the scope of this? Does this affect things I do
		outside of Gentoo?</b></p>

		<p>A: No. The scope of the agreement is limited to what is defined in
		the work description section, which is very specific. The work
		description includes anything you commit to our cvs servers, anything
		sent to submissions@gentoo.org, and anything included in a bugzilla
		bug report. Everything else does not fall under the scope of the
		agreement.</p>

		<p><b>Q: Does this only apply to official developers?</b></p>

		<p>A: No. Anyone contributing over a page of work should also assign
		copyright to Gentoo.  GPG keys should be sent to
		<mail link="submissions@gentoo.org">submissions@gentoo.org</mail>
		with submitted work either attached or indicated via a URL.
		Contributors who need to submit forms can contact
		<mail link="recruiters@gentoo.org">recruiters@gentoo.org</mail>.</p>

		<body>
		<p>There are two necessary steps: the submission of a GPG public key
		and the submission of a signature on the copyright assignment
		document. GPG public keys should be mailed to
		<mail link="recruiters@gentoo.org">recruiters@gentoo.org</mail>.
		Digital signatures are acceptable, as are scanned images of
		properly signed agreements.
		It is available online at
		<uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/copyright/assignment.pdf</uri> and
		also at <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/copyright/assignment.txt</uri>.
