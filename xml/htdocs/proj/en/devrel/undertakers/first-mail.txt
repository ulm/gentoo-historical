Subject: Requesting status update for developer DEVNAME

Dear FIRSTNAME,

We are in the process of requesting status updates for developers that
haven't committed anything in the gentoo-x86 cvs tree for more than two
months but they have bugs assigned to them and unattended. 

It appears your last commits was in <LASTCVS> and your last bugzilla
activity was in <LASTBUGZILLA>.

Please consider dropping some of your packages to
maintainer-needed@gentoo.org so other people can step up and maintain them
in case you have no time anymore. If this is a viable option for you, please
send an e-mail to the gentoo-dev mailing list to tell us which packages are
up for grabs.

If you don't have enough time to do this, please send us via mail a list of
packages to handle and we will do the reassignment and sending of mail.   

You are free to get these packages back (or co-maintain them if new
maintainer agrees) if you find more time in the future.

If you don't reply to this in 2 weeks, we will do that ourselves. Please, be
aware that if we haven't heard from you within 4 months, we
will start the retirement process. If you are busy and you have no time
anymore, please use the devaway system to inform us about your absence.
