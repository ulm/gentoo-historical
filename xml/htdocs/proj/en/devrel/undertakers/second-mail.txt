Subject: Possible retirement of developer DEVNAME

Dear FIRSTNAME,

Possible retirement pending as you haven't shown any activity in the past
four (or more) months.

 - Last (viewable) bugzilla activity:
   LASTBUGZILLA
 - Last CVS activity:
   LASTCVS

If you are just away, then please use the devaway system. Please be advised
that devaway may also be considered inactive if it extends past 60 days.

Please reply and advise on your situation. Any developer found to be
inactive for a period in excess of 4 months is subject to be retired. Please
be aware that if we have not heard from you within 2 months time, we will
begin the retirement process.

If we do retire you, it's pretty easy to come back when you are ready. Just
do the ebuild/end-quiz again and you're back on.
