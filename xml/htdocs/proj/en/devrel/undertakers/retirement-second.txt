Subject: Second notice: Possible retirement of DEVNAME

Dear FIRSTNAME,

Possible retirement pending as you haven't shown any activity in the past two
(or more) months.

 - Last (viewable) bugzilla activity:
   LASTBUGZILLA
 - Last CVS activity:
   LASTCVS

If you are just away, then please use the devaway system. Any developer found
to be inactive for a period in excess of 60 days is subject to be retired.

While we hate to lose a developer who has made such an impact on Gentoo,
Developer Relations is tasked with the maintenance of our developer pool, to
include the retirement of inactive developers and revoking their access
privileges.

We do understand that life brings us unexpected changes and you simply may
not have the time, resources, etc to contribute on a more frequent basis,
every month or two is the preferred minimum. If we do retire you, it's
pretty easy to come back when you are ready. Just do the ebuild/end-quiz
again and you're back on. You also always have the option of contributing as
your schedule allows via proxy or bugzilla.

Please reply and advise on your situation. Please be aware that if we have
not heard from you within 2 weeks time, we will begin the retirement
process.

King regards,

  Christian Heim
