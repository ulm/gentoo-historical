<title>Steps to retire a developer</title>
<section>
<body>

<ul>
<li>Check cvs and bugzilla activity
<ul><li>An easy way to check cvs activity is by using the command "cvs history
-c -u devname | sort | less" which displays devname's activity across all cvs
repositories. We also have monthly cvs slacker mails mailed to
devrel@gentoo.org on the 1st of every month and
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/undertakers/scripts">http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/undertakers/scripts</uri> contains
various homegrown scripts as well that mostly needs to be run from
cvs.gentoo.org.</li>
<li>Check http://bugday.gentoo.org/bugsgoactivity.php?id=devname to see the
last few bugzilla activities. Activity is defined very broadly in this case so
commenting, changing resolution, cc'ing etc. all count as activity. You need to
look at each of those bugs to decide if the activity is related to
development.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Try talking to leads if the developer looks inactive - the developer might
be active in ways we can't determine easily but is still useful to Gentoo.
Ping the developer on irc, sent him/her an email etc. You don't have to do all
of this but make a reasonable effort to make sure the developer is indeed
inactive before starting the retirement process.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>File a retirement bug. If the developer already has a "New Dev" bug convert
that to a retirement bug. Retirement bugs should be in the Developer Relations
product and assigned to devrel@gentoo.org with the developer cc'ed. State on
the bug last commit and bugs activity if applicable. Also state any appropriate
input you may have gotten from leads.</li>

<li>Make sure the developer is cc'ed on the bug.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Wait at minimum two weeks to give the developer adequate time to respond on
the bug. Often 3 or even 4 weeks are more appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Consider any responses carefully. We're supposed to help Gentoo (in this
case by keeping the developer base "clean"), not to retire as many developers
as possible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Close bug if developer is considered active.</li>
<li>If the developer doesn't respond in the time given or is otherwise still
considered inactive cc infra-bugs@gentoo.org on the bug and add a comment
asking infrastructure to retire the developer.</li>
<li>CC infra per their retirement <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/retire-process.xml">process</uri>
and wait for them to report it as complete.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Remove access to #gentoo-dev (access is either removed completely or
changed to voice depending or whether they ask for it or they're still
considered active and helpful in the channel).</li>
<li>Ask a freenode staffer to remove any gentoo cloak.</li>
<!-- is already done by infra
<li>Ask forums people to adjust any forum account.</li>
<li>Ask planet.gentoo.org admins to remove the developer from planet / universe
/ soc planets.</li> -->
<li>Update userinfo.xml with new status (ldap is done automatically by
infrastructures script).</li>
<li>Clean up metadata.xml's in the portage tree (easiest done using the
retire.py script by marienz available at
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/undertakers/scripts/retire.py.txt">http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/undertakers/scripts/retire.py.txt</uri>).</li>
</ul>
