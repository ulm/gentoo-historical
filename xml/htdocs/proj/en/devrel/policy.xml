		<section>
		<title>Introduction</title>
			<body>		
			<p>While conflicts serious enough to require developer relations involvement are rare, it's inevitable
			that developers will clash to varying degrees. It's essential that the developer relations team find fair and impartial
			resolutions to inter-developer problems. Although all situations differ and exercising good judgment is necessary,
			these guidelines are intended to define the most acceptable course of action.
			</p>

		<section>
		<title>When should developer relations be involved?</title>
			<body>
			<p>Developer relations should only be involved in a conflict when other attempts to solve the issue have failed.
			Developers should attempt polite discussion relating to the matter at hand to resolve conflict between themselves.
			Developers within a single top level project (TLP) engaged in conflict may wish to consult with the TLP manager. Although
			TLP managers are not necessarily qualified to resolve personal disputes, technical issues resulting in conflict can often
			be resolved within the TLP without developer relations involvement. Personal issues should be brought to the ombudsman via
			<mail link="ombudsman@gentoo.org">ombudsman@gentoo.org</mail>. Developer relations may get involved when the above methods have failed.
			For resolution of technical conflicts spanning more than one TLP, see the section entitled 'Presenting information to management.'
			</p>
			<p>Issues not necessarily related to personal conflict, such as intentional or repeated policy breaches, malicious or abrasive behavior to users
			or developers, or similar developer-specific behavorial problems should be brought directly to developer relations via <mail link="devrel@gentoo.org">devrel@gentoo.org</mail>.
			This should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by developer relations and may require disciplinary action as defined by the section entitled 'Disciplinary action.'
			</p>
			</body>

		<section>
		<title>Presenting information to management</title>
			<body>
			<p>Often, conflicts between managers and developers will require a decision be made by the management team.
			To avoid forcing the management team to investigate all the data already processed by developer relations, a condensed summary
			of the issues at hand as they relate to the decision being made should be presented. It should be totally unbiased and present
			all factual information from both sides. A recommendation may or may not be made at the discretion of the developer relations manager(s).
			Recommendations should be strictly limited to the (usually technical) issue at hand and should be reviewed by the developer relations team
			prior to submission.
			</p>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
		<title>Disciplinary action</title>
			<body>
			<p>Disciplinary action must be decided on a case-by-case basis by the developer relations leads. For the majority of situations requiring disciplinary action,
			a warning is enough to correct future behavior. If behavior does not improve, a probationary period with revoked access to Gentoo infrastructure of two weeks to
			one month is appropriate. If upon restoration of access negative behavior re-occurs, removal from the project will be necessary. In extreme cases, suspension or
			removal may be necessary upon a single offense. This is left to the discretion of developer relations leads.
			</p>
			<p>Upon removing a developer, the gentoo-core mailing list should be notified. Additionally, the developer relations team and ombudsman should be informed of the issues that led to
			removing or suspending a developer. The ombudsman should keep a record of this for future reference. Developers who are removed from the project may not reapply
			for developer status without first being cleared by the developer relations leads and the ombudsman.
			</p>

		<title>Miscellany</title>
		<section>
		<title>Extended leaves of absence</title>
			<body>
			<p>Developers must notify the gentoo-core (and optionally gentoo-dev) mailing list and <mail link="devrel@gentoo.org">devrel@gentoo.org</mail> prior to taking an 
			extended leave of absence. This is defined as inactivity for any period of time longer than 30 days. Access to Gentoo infrastructure may be disabled during this time 
			for security reasons. If developer relations is not made aware prior to an extended period of inactivity, after 60 days the developer will be considered retired and
			any return will be at the discretion of the developer relations leads and the relevant project manager, if applicable.
			</p>
			</body>
		</section>
		<section>
		<title>Post-retirement</title>
			<body>
			<p>Retired developers will have their gentoo.org email address removed from Gentoo mailing lists to prevent mail bounces. Retired developers are
			responsible for resubscribing to public lists with a non-Gentoo email address. Gentoo email addresses for retired developers will remain as forwards for
			a period of time specified by infrastructure to allow developers time to transition their mail.
