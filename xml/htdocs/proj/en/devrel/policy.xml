			<p>While conflicts serious enough to require devrel involvement are rare, it's inevitable
			that developers will clash to varying degrees. It's essential that devrel find fair and impartial
			resolutions to interdeveloper problems. Although all situations differ and exercising good judgement is necessary,
			these guidelines are intended to define the most acceptable course of action.

		<title>Presenting information to management</title>
			<body>
			<p>Often, conflicts between managers and developers will require a decision be made by the management team.
			To avoid forcing the management team to investigate all the data already processed by devrel, a condensed summary
			of the issues at hand as they relate to the decision being made should be presented. It should be totally unbiased and present
			all factual information from both sides. A recommendation may or may not be made at the discretion of the devrel manager(s).
			Recommendations should be strictly limited to the (usually technical) issue at hand and should be reviewed by the devrel team
			prior to submission.
