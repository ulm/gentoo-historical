<title>What is Gentoo Developer Relations?</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
	Gentoo Developer Relations is a project in Gentoo which aims to be a
	point of contact for prospective developers, as well as a point of
	contact for current developers.  For prospective developers, we use the
	mailing lists, the forums and the
	<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org"> Gentoo bug tracker</uri> to watch for, and invite, prospective
	developers.
</p>
<p>
	The stated goal for Gentoo Developer Relations is to act as a meeting
	point for Gentoo developers and advanced users both.  As such, Gentoo
	Developer Relations is concerned with both intra-developer relations as
	well as forming relations with advanced users and prospective
	developers.

<title>Active Subprojects</title>
<body>
<p>
   The current active subprojects in Gentoo Developer Relations are:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Project:</th>
		<th>Description:</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<ti>Intra-Developer Relations</ti>
		<ti>Here, we maintain a constantly updated roster of developers, and
		their areas of development.  This will be not only the devlist, but
		also the herds document, which will list the various herd projects
		in the portage tree, along with the herd manager (point of contact). 
		Additionally, we maintain a record of developers' GPG public keys to
		provide a single area for developer lookup.</ti>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<ti>Recruitment and Training</ti>
		<ti>Currently, we have a process on the <uri
		link="http://bugs.gentoo.org"> Gentoo bug tracker</uri> which tracks a
		new developer's progress from initial contact through training and
		final sign up.  As part of a new developer's training, they must
		fulfill several requirements, culminating in a quiz/questionnaire.
		Every new developer is assigned to a mentor on the Gentoo
		development team.</ti>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<ti><uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/user-relations.xml">User Relations</uri></ti>
		<ti>The goal of this subproject is to interface with the user
		community, to seek out motivated and skilled individuals for
		prospective hiring.  Essentially, the concerns of the community with
		respect to developer relations will be listened to, and where
		possible, addressed.
		Potential developers should be able to easily learn about current
		projects, project goals, openings in areas where their skills may be
		used etc.  Also there are bound to be many advanced users who may not
		wish to become developers, yet do have the expertise to help enrich
		Gentoo. We will investigate ways in which these individuals might help
		the development community (via document translation, bug resolution 
		etc.) 
		An established method of listening to user concerns regarding
		developments issues is important. The forums, IRC and mailing lists
		do a great job, but development-specific questions/suggestions/concerns
		should ideally be made available to the development community.
		Gentoo Developer Relations will aim to provide timely feedback to these
		suggestions, or forward their suggestions to the relevant parties.</ti>

<p>
   The current planned subprojects in Gentoo Developer Relations are:
   <table>
	<tr>
		<th>Project:</th>
		<th>Description:</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<ti>Developer Conflict Resolution</ti>
		<ti>Grant Goodyear recently proposed a <uri
		link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/"> GLEP (Gentoo Linux
		Enhancement Proposal)</uri> calling for an <uri
		link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0007.html">Ombudsman</uri>
		to aid in developer conflict resolution.  We would like to implement
		this plan in the near future.  Also pro-active policies that are
		aimed at preventing technical/interpersonal conflicts will be
		developed; set channels of communication will also be developed in which
		developers can voice concerns (anything from technical disagreements
		to developer burnout) confidentially before these concerns degenerate 
		into personal conflicts.</ti>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<ti>Recruitment Policy</ti>
		<ti>One of the biggest questions in the user community is how to
		become a Gentoo Developer.  We will attempt to outline our
		requirements for a prospective developer as well as provide an
		interface for prospective developers to contact the recruitment and
		training team.  The requirements outline will include both etiquette
		and development guidelines for developers.  One idea would be to
		create a comprehensive Developers' Handbook to cover everything from
		development policy through etiquette expectations to conflict
		resolution.  Currently, interested parties can contact
		<mail link="recruiters@gentoo.org">recruiters</mail></ti>
