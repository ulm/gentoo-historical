<p>
	On the eve of the 2004.0 release the major topic of discussion was
	the release process.  The discussion wandered from how many releases
	we should have per year, to what our release candidates should be, to
	what distinguishes a release from a random <c>emerge -u world</c>, and to
	the ubiquitous issue of quality control.  Minor topics included 
	reverse dependencies (wait for portage-ng) and removal of unused
	dependencies (<c>emerge depclean</c>, but be careful!).  The
	meeting adjourned at 2028 UTC.  See the raw
