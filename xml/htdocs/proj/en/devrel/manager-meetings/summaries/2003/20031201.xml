<title>New Release Naming Scheme</title>
<section><body><p>
Drobbins took the floor to discuss and collect votes on the
proposal at <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/</uri>. The naming scheme
will be "2004.1" instead of "2004x1," despite the jesting about
Microsoft Office 2003. Some discussion ensued about what to do with profiles,
since the current ones have "1.4" in them; the consensus was that there would
have to be more discussion on it. Gentoo will stick with the 2.4.x kernel
series <u>as a default</u> until 2.6 is more mature.
</p>
<p>
Voting for the new naming scheme took place with two managers missing:
<ul>
<li>drobbins - aye</li>
<li>iggy - aye</li>
<li>pauldv - aye</li>
<li>klieber - aye</li>
<li>swift - aye</li>
<li>method - aye (late)</li>
<li>seemant - aye (late)</li>
<li>pvdabeel - missing</li>
</ul>

<title>GLEP 14 Status Update</title>
<section><body><p>
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0014.html">GLEP 14</uri> is designed to "check a Gentoo system for identified security holes or
auto-apply security fixes."
</p>
<p>
Genone presented the progress of the GLEP 14 implementation.
The DTD needs to be finalized, and there will be a meeting on GLSA
Development later this week.  There is a website with all the GLSAs
using an xsl stylesheet, but it is not yet online, nor is there an
index.  plasmaroo is writing a QT tool to aide in writing GLSAs. 
Integration into Portage will have to wait until there is capability to
sign things (>=49-r19).

<title>Automatically-Accepted Licenses</title>
<section><body><p>
Lately, quite a lot of threads in the gentoo-dev mailing list revolve
around the request of some users to be able to arbitrarily accept or
deny software licenses. The current decision is to have a make.conf
variable called ACCEPT_LICENSES (similiar to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS) which can
be set by the user. This would, of course, require changes to portage.
Therefore, a GLEP will be written in order to specify the underlying
philosophy and implementation details.
