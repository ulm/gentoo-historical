	<description>This sub-project handles the bi-weekly Gentoo Managers' Meetings</description>
	<longdescription>
		<p>
		The Gentoo Managers' Meetings serve the purpose of discussion of various
		topics of concern to Gentoo development from the perspective of the top
		level projects.  As such, every top level manager in the Gentoo project is
		expected to be in attendance.  The top level project structure is discussed
		in <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/metastructure/projects.xml">the
		Gentoo project outline</uri>, and is a work in progress as of this date.
		</p>

		<p>The Managers' Meetings will occur on a two week schedule, with a
		different chairperson to preside over each meeting.  The chairperson will be
		chosen by the Gentoo Developer Relations team from among the non-manager
		developers in the Gentoo project.  All Gentoo developers are encouraged to
		attend the meetings.
		</p>

		<p>The Managers' Meetings are also a venue whereby all developers can
		express their own concerns with the issues at hand.  During the meeting, the
		irc channel will be moderated and only managers will be permitted to speak.
		However, a question-answer session follows as the final agenda item at every
		meeting.  This means the channel will become unmoderated.

	<title>Roles in a Meeting</title>
	<section>
	<title>Chairperson's Role</title>
	<body>
	<p>
	This section provides the general guidelines on being a chairperson.

	Prior to the meeting:
	<ul>
	<li>Receive agenda items of the forthcoming meeting from all attendees.</li>
	<li>Email the core mailing list with the agenda of the forthcoming meeting no later than 24 hours in advance of the meeting.
	</li>
	</ul>

	During the meeting:
	<ul>
	<li>Keep the meeting flowing. This means maintaining focus on the agenda and
	the objectives of the meeting.</li>
	<li>Keep the meeting within its allotted time frame (usually one hour)</li>
	<li>Allow the presentation of an agenda item by the person responsible for
	that item, before any questions and discussion is undertaken.</li>
	<li>Get responses from all members before moving onto the next agenda
	item.</li>
	<li>Briefly summarize unresolved business. This may include the result of
	the discussion, specific actions that are to be taken, who's responsible for
	working on what etc.</li>
	<li>Allow all attendees to be able to discuss their concerns after the
	agenda items have been discussed.</li>
	</ul>

	After the meeting:
	<ul>
	<li>Email the meeting log to the gentoo-core mailing list within a specified
	period.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	The Chairperson is expected tro maintain neutrality throughout the meeting.
	If the chairperson feels, upon receipt of the agenda items (to be discussed
	below), that they are strongly attached to the outcome of the discussion,
	we leave it on their honour to remove themselves from the Chair and let
	an alternate person chair the meeting.
	</p>
	</body>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>Managers' Roles</title>
	<body>
	<p>
	Managers also have a role to play.  Their expectations are outlined below.
	</p>
	Prior to the meeting:
	<ul>
	<li>Pesent agenda items to the chairperson no later than 3 days in advance.
	Special consideration to emergency items will be given, and at the
	chairperson's discretion, last minute agenda items may be added.</li>
	<li>Read agenda items of fellow attendees and prepare comments on them.
	This may involve reading a <uri
	link="http://glep.gentoo.org/">GLEP</uri>.</li>
	<li>Clear calendar around meeting time, and arrive on time (Seemant!)</li>
	</ul>

	During the meeting:
	<ul>
	<li>Freely share their ideas on the topics at hand and be open to others'
	perspectives.</li>
	<li>Act in a friendly and professional manner. The meeting may give the
	chairperson a lasting impression on how Gentoo is run, and will definitely
	leave an impression on your fellow developers.</li>
	<li>Understand that the chairperson is the governing authority for the
	meeting.  When the chair has determined that the next agenda item should be
	discussed, the managers should concede.  Any open items needing further
	discussion may be rescheduled for a subsequent meeting or discussed more
	widely on the gentoo-core mailing list.</li>
	</ul>
	</body>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>Attendees' Roles</title>
	<body>
	<p>
	During the discussion, the channel will be moderated.  However, the final
	agenda item for every single meeting is a free-flow question and answer
	session.  This is the time for developers to query and discuss issues
	brought up during the meeting.  Please be forthcoming about your concerns,
	because as a developer, your voice is important!
	</p>
	<p>
	If you have an urgent question or other input that hinges on the flow of the
	current agenda item, please send an IRC /msg to the Chairperson, so that
	they may forward your question onto the floor.
	</p>
	<p>
	During the question and answer session, please be mindful that many people
	will want to ask questions. That being the case, please avoid repetition of
	questions.  Again, the rules of civility do govern all.
	</p>
	</body>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>Universal Expectations</title>
	<body>
	<p>The following rules apply to <b>everybody</b>.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Do <b>NOT</b> criticize people.</li>
	<li>Other's ideas should be respected. This doesn't mean that you have to
	agree, but rather that you have to listen.</li>
	<li>Keep an open mind.</li>
	<li>Ask questions when you do not understand something and be tolerant of
	those who ask questions.</li>
	<li>Help the chairperson by keeping the discussion focused on the issues at
	hand.  Digression should be minimised.</li>
	<li>Do <b>NOT</b> leave issues hanging. Assign responsibility for each
	action to be taken.</li>
	</ul>

	<title>Preparation for Meetings</title>
	<section>
	<body>
	<p>Gentoo's <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel">Developer
	Relations personnel</uri> is responsible for selecting the chairperson for
	upcoming managers' meetings.  The chair will be announced no later than one
	week in advance of a meeting.  The proposed chair will be contacted prior to
	that and upon receipt of their consent, the announcement will be made to the
	core mailing list.  Managers are then responsible for informing the
	chairperson of their agenda items.
	</p>
	<p>The selection of the chairperson, during the initial phase of this new
	system will be made carefully by the DevRel personnel.  We are attempting to
	choose people based on: the length of time they have been with the project,
	their record of maturity and level-headedness, their neutrality of the
	issues, and their willingness and consent.  Additionally, a chair person can <b>NOT</b> be a top level manager.
	</p>
	<p>Once the initial test phase of this system is successful, chairpersons will
	be chosen fairly at random from a pool of developers who have been with the
	project for a minimum of three (3) months
	</p>
	<p>Each meeting will have an objective.  That is to say, each agenda item
	will have an objective, be it to gain consensus from all the managers or to
	assign a prioritised list of actions for ideas, etc.
	</p>
