<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo provides developers with all the necessary services which they
might need for their development efforts. If you require anything
else, please do not hesitate to contact the Infrastructure Team!
</p>

<p>
Once you are an authorized developer, your recruiter should organize
the following services.  If you experience any problems, please see
your recruiter or the mentioned staff with access to the required
service.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Bugzilla</title>
<body>

<p>
Developers are able to change all aspects of bugs in Bugzilla. If you
have an existing account the email address should be changed to your
Gentoo address by a Bugzilla administrator.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>CVS</title>
<body>

<p>
Not all developers receive CVS access - if you require Portage access
to the gentoo, gentoo-projects, or gentoo-x86 tree get someone on the
recruiters team to do this for you. You may need to justify your need
for this to happen, however.
</p>

<section>
<title>IRC</title>
<body>

<p>
When you are a developer, you will receive a <c>gentoo/developer/*</c> cloak
signifying that you are a developer. If you do not, please contact recruiters
or ask on the <c>#gentoo-groupcontacts</c> channel. Please be aware that
Freenode cloaks may neither contain underscores (<c>_</c>) nor dots (<c>.</c>)
in the last part, so you must either choose an appropriate nickname or a
differing cloak.
</p>

<p>
Along with that you get operator status on #gentoo-dev.
Additionally, team leads may decide to give you operator status on specialized
channels such as #gentoo-hardened, for example. Abuse of operator powers on
#gentoo-dev may lead to your operator powers being removed instantly along with
the possible removal of your developership. If you are given operator powers,
we ask that you use them constructively to benefit everybody when either
developers or users break up the cleanliness of the channels.
</p>

<p>
The #gentoo IRC channel is no longer controlled  by Developer Relations,
but by the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/ops/index.xml">gentoo-ops</uri>
project. Operator status in #gentoo does not in any way signify that the
user is a developer.
</p>

<p>
"Special" Gentoo channels such as #gentoo-hardened and #gentoo-server are
given to people at the discretion of the team - in this case, the hardened
and server teams.
</p>

<p>
IRC Channels are owned by their relevant project leads, whether strategical
or operational and the owner has the discretion of voicing or unvoicing
members of the public. If you believe that those powers are being abused or
are being used with wrong considerations; then speak to the Gentoo Linux
Developer Relations team.

<title>Forums [Optional]</title>
<body>

<p>
Ask one of the forums administrators in #gentoo-forums or
forum-mods@gentoo.org to update your forum status on the Gentoo
Forums, if needed. Forum accounts are not mandatory.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Planet [Optional]</title>
<body>

<p>
Developers who have a personal blog can request to be added to the planet
aggregator.  The planet software creates a custom feed of all developer's blog
posts, separated into two categories: on-topic (Gentoo and computer related
content) on Planet Gentoo, and all topics on Gentoo Universe.
</p>

<p>
Also, if a user does not already have a blog, we host our own blogging software
and can create an account for you.
</p>

<p>
Please see <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/userrel/planet/index.xml</uri> for
more details.
</p>

<section>
<title>Mail</title>
<body>

<p>
All developers are provided with a developer@gentoo.org mail address
for Gentoo use.
</p>

<p>
Please see <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/dev-email.xml</uri> 
for more details.

<section>
<title>Mailing lists</title>
<body>

<p>
All developers must be subscribed to the <c>gentoo-core</c> and 
<c>gentoo-dev-announce</c> mailing lists. All developers should be subscribed
to <c>gentoo-dev</c> and <c>gentoo-project</c>, though neither are developer 
requirements. Contact someone on the Recruiters team to subscribe you to the 
above mailing lists or if you are having difficulties. 
</p>

<p>
gentoo-core is to be used for internal discussions; technical discussions 
should be discussed on gentoo-dev; non-technical discussions should be discussed
on gentoo-project; while gentoo-dev-announce is for announcements only. If you
send a message to dev-announce, and expect a discussion to take place relating
to it, you should manually cross-post and set reply-to suitably.
</p>

<p>
If you are subscribed on any other Gentoo mailing lists, you should unsubscribe
and resubscribe with your new mail address. 
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Shell access</title>
<body>

<p>
Developers currently get a shell account on dev.gentoo.org -
this provides mail storage, SMTP relaying and also
an IRC tunnel for developers to use to access freenode.
</p>

<p>
To ensure security, access is only available through SSH keys, which
your mentor should place on your account and allow you to log in:
please see <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/cvs-sshkeys.xml</uri>
for more details regarding SSH keys..

<title>Service usage policies</title>
<body>
<p>
Services provided by Gentoo should only be used for Gentoo development
work. Infrastructure has the right to disable any accounts which are a
security risk, these include inactive accounts which will be
suspended by the infrastructure team if you are presumed idle, 
and your IRC #gentoo-dev status would also be voiced.
</p>
<p>
If any files in your account are found to be harmful towards other developers
or users on the box, or pose a risk to the Gentoo project (such as illegal
.torrents), Gentoo Infrastructure will suspend your account which would only
be unlocked after investigation from Gentoo Developer Relations. In most cases,
your developership may be suspended if such files are found. The same
policies also apply to Gentoo CVS and other Gentoo-provided services you may
be offered.
</p>
</body>

<section>
<title>Activity policies</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo understands that as life changes, so may your availability. We 
respectfully request that if you know you will be unavailable for an extended 
period of time (vacation, big project at work, family needs, etc) that you
utilize the devaway system.
</p>

<pre caption="When going away">
<comment>on dev.gentoo.org</comment>
$ <i>echo "Away until 2007-08-30, contact $dev1 in my absence" &gt; ~/.away</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="When coming back">
<comment>on dev.gentoo.org</comment>
$ <i>rm ~/.away</i>
</pre>

<p>
In the on going effort to keep our developer pool up-to-date and our resources
secure, Developer Relations periodically reviews developer activity in the 
search for inactive developers. A developer is considered inactive if no 
contributions are made over a period of 60 days. Activity is determined by CVS
commits, bugzilla statistics, and peer feedback. Not everyone's activities are
so easily traced, as such, Developer Relations often requests feedback from a 
project lead or team members of a developer suspected to be inactive.
</p>

<p>
Any developer suspected to be inactive for a period in excess of 60 days may be
subject to retirement. Developer Relations will first research and assess the
situation, attempt to contact the developer, or if attempts are unsuccessful 
may chose to retire the developer. Please note that if you are in devaway for
more than 60 days, you may also be considered inactive, however, return
dates will be taken into consideration. If you are retired due to inactivity 
and wish to return, you need only contact Recruiters to begin the recruitment
process again.
