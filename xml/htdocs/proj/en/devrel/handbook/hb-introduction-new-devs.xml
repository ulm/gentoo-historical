<title>Using CVS</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
This guide is not intended to be a manual on using CVS; for that, take a look at
the CVS info page or <uri>/doc/en/cvs-tutorial.xml</uri>.
Instead, this guide focuses specifically on using CVS and Repoman in Gentoo's
ebuild tree.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Typically, you'll want something along these lines in your <path>~/.cvsrc</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="~/.cvsrc">
cvs -q -z0
diff -u -B
checkout -P
update -d -P
</pre>

<p>
In order to make sure digests are correct, please put <c>cvs</c> in your <c>FEATURES</c> setting.
</p>

<p>
Finally, many people using CVS like to use compression (-z#). We ask that
developers who are not on dialup connections please use -z0 - with the contents
of our CVS repository and the load on our CVS server, you actually experience a 
speed <e>increase</e> without compression.
</p>

<title>Checking out from CVS/SVN</title>
<body>

<p>
There are a few useful modules in Gentoo's CVS repository. Ebuilds are kept in
the <path>gentoo-x86</path> module. <path>gentoo</path> contains the XML
for the website, documentation, developer directories, developer pictures,
and so on. <path>gentoo-projects</path> contains various projects and generally
replaces the <path>gentoo-src</path> cvs module.  <path>gentoo-src</path> is
kept around for history, please transition to a different cvs module if you
are still using it.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking out gentoo-x86">
# cvs -d username@cvs.gentoo.org:/var/cvsroot co gentoo-x86
</pre>

<p>
Before working in the tree at any time, it's always a good idea to do an 
update to check for changes and prevent conflicts. You can update in any 
subdirectory of the tree if you don't want to wait for a tree-wide update, but 
from time to time it's a good idea to update your entire tree:
</p>

<pre caption="Updating in gentoo-x86">
# cd gentoo-x86
# cvs update
</pre>

<p>
Gentoo also offers subversion services for those who prefer SVN over CVS. 
Many core projects such as <path>portage</path> and <path>baselayout</path> 
are hosted here now.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking out portage">
# svn co svn+ssh://username@cvs.gentoo.org/var/svnroot/portage
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Updating Portage</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to use CVS as your primary Portage tree, you can add the following
lines to <path>/etc/make.conf</path>, replacing <c>you</c> with your username:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing /etc/make.conf for use with CVS">
SYNC="cvs://you@cvs.gentoo.org:/var/cvsroot"
CVSROOT=":ext:you@cvs.gentoo.org:/var/cvsroot"
</pre>

<p>
Whether you wish to use a CVS checkout as your primary Portage tree or not,
you should ensure that <c>cvs</c> is in your <c>FEATURES</c> in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>. This makes sure Portage downloads all the
files an ebuild references in its <c>SRC_URI</c> when making a digest.
</p>

<p>
You can add <c>digest</c> to your <c>FEATURES</c>, letting
Portage automatically create new digests. You can also add
<c>autoaddcvs</c> so <c>repoman</c>, the tool which you will use to
commit in ebuilds, would automatically add missing digests for you into CVS.
</p>

<p>
On supported architectures, you should also have <c>sandbox</c> in your
<c>FEATURES</c> to ensure ebuilds do not modify the root filesystem
directly.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Adding/Removing packages</title>
<body>

<p>
Say you're ready to add a brand new package, <c>foo</c>, in app-misc:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding a package">
<comment>(Replace CVSROOT with the location of your checked-out CVS tree.)</comment>
# cd $CVSROOT/app-misc
<comment>(Always update before working in part of the CVS tree!)</comment>
# cvs update
# mkdir foo
<comment>(Here, we add the package directory foo to the CVS repository.)</comment>
# cvs add foo
# cd foo
<comment>(It's better to keep in-progress ebuilds in an overlay outside of your CVS tree.)</comment>
# cp /path/to/foo-1.0.ebuild ./
<comment>[Don't forget to create a ChangeLog - see the man page for echangelog.]</comment>
<comment>(Make sure PORTDIR_OVERLAY is set to the CVS directory when creating digests.)</comment>
# ebuild foo-1.0.ebuild digest
# cvs add foo-1.0.ebuild ChangeLog files
<comment>(FEATURES=autoaddcvs will do this for you...)</comment>
# cvs add files/digest-foo-1.0
</pre>

<p>
Remember to also add a metadata.xml file with maintainer
information. See the <uri link="?part=2&amp;chap=4">Gentoo
Metadata</uri> section for more information.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you're ready to commit (see the section on Commits
below). But what if you want to remove foo-1.0 when foo-1.1 is out?
</p>

<pre caption="Removing old versions">
# cd CVSROOT/app-misc/foo
# cvs update
# cvs remove -f foo-1.0.ebuild files/digest-foo-1.0
</pre>

<p>
And now you're ready to commit (see the section on Commits below).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Commits</title>
<body>

<p>
Always use <c>repoman commit</c> rather than <c>cvs commit</c>. Repoman is a quality assurance (QA)
tool that performs basic checks and creates Manifests. If any part of repoman's output is unclear,
please see <c>man repoman</c>. Additionally, you may tire of entering your key passphrase repeatedly;
keychain (<uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain.xml</uri>) can help you.
</p>

<pre caption="Using repoman">
<comment>[Make sure there are no root-owned files present prior to running repoman!]</comment>
<comment>("scan" scans the current directory for QA issues. "full" is more complete.)</comment>
# repoman scan
<comment>("commit" does a scan, then commits, while also updating digests. Make sure you
 add a verbose and useful CVS ChangeLog message...)</comment>
# repoman commit
</pre>

</body>

<title>Miscellaneous</title>
<subsection>
<title>Putting files on mirrors</title>
<body>

<p>
The procedure for dropping a new file in distfiles on Gentoo mirrors is very simple: 
copy it to <path>/space/distfiles-local</path> on <path>dev.gentoo.org</path>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Mail</title>
<body>

<p>
Our infrastructure allows developers to manage their own mail.
<uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/dev-email.xml</uri>
contains instructions on configuring your gentoo.org mail.
</p>

<title>Planet Gentoo "blogging"</title>
<body>

<p>
We run a service, <uri link="http://planet.gentoo.org">Planet Gentoo</uri>, which
aggregates articles written by contributing developers. This is optional, but it
is encouraged that you participate. It helps communication between developers and
users find it to be an interesting read too.
</p>

<p>
In order to post content to the planet, you need to have your own weblog
("blog"). Many sites provide this as a free service, or you can host it
yourself (if you have the resources). Alternatively, we can host a blog for
you.
</p>

<p>
We aim to keep Planet Gentoo's content relevant to Gentoo and/or Gentoo-related
developments and events.
</p>

<p>
If we host your blog for you, you are expected to keep the content on-topic
(Gentoo and Gentoo-related articles). You also need to understand that if you
ever lose or drop your developer status, you will no longer be able to write
articles on your blog.
</p>

<p>
If you have a blog elsewhere, then it needs to be able to provide an XML
content feed. If you blog into categories, we need to be able to get an XML
feed which covers your "Gentoo" category but no others. This is probably a
non-issue, as almost all blogs provide standardised feeds like this.
</p>

<p>
Although this is somewhat common sense, please be careful with what you write
about. Your views may be inappropriately interpreted as the views of Gentoo.
Please be careful not to damage our image.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in contributing to Planet Gentoo, please write to
<uri link="mailto:user-relations@gentoo.org">user-relations@gentoo.org</uri>,
either requesting a weblog to be hosted by Gentoo, or giving details of your
already existing weblog. We'll then work out the details and get you up and
running.
