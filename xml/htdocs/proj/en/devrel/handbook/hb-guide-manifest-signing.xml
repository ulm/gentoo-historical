<title>How to sign Manifests?</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
Requirements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>&gt;=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51_pre10</li>
  <li>&gt;=app-crypt/gnupg-1.2.4</li>
</ul>

<p>
Key Setup:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gnupg-user.xml#doc_chap2">Create</uri>
    a new DSA GnuPG key with at least a 1024 bit keylength, an expiration
    period no longer than 6 months and a good passphrase.
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gnupg-user.xml#doc_chap3">Upload</uri>
    the key to a keyserver.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Portage Configuration:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Set <path>PORTAGE_GPG_DIR</path> to your <path>~/.gnupg/</path> directory
    (or the directory where the keyring with your new key is).
  </li>
  <li>Set <path>PORTAGE_GPG_KEY</path> to the key id of your new key.</li>
  <li>Set FEATURES="sign".</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now you should be able to sign your Manifests on repoman commit. Repoman will
ask you for your passphrase before committing the Manifest. This step is
<e>after</e> it has committed the other files. At the moment repoman doesn't
check if the Manifest is already signed, so others are able to "unsign" your
package later. This will change before signing is made mandatory.
