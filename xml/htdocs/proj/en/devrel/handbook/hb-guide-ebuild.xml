<title>The Portage tree</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The Portage tree is typically found at <path>/usr/portage</path> and is 
organized in a hierarchical structure consisting of category directories, 
followed by specific package directories.  Here's an example; you can find
the <path>util-linux-2.11y.ebuild</path> file in the 
<path>/usr/portage/sys-apps/util-linux</path> directory.  There may be 
several other versions of <c>util-linux</c> ebuilds alongside 
<path>util-linux-2.11y.ebuild</path>.  This is because <e>all ebuilds for 
a particular package (regardless of version)</e>, share the same 
<path>mycat/mypkg</path> directory in <path>/usr/portage</path>.
</p>

<title>Checking Out the Portage Tree from CVS</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are unfamiliar with the CVS system, please read the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/cvs-tutorial.xml">CVS Tutorial</uri>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
The Portage tree can be found in the <c>gentoo-x86</c> module of the 
Gentoo Linux tree.  To check out the module (about 350 megabytes) you 
would first set up CVS via the above guide, then check out the 
<c>gentoo-x86</c> module.
</p>

<title>What (not) to put in the Portage tree</title>
<body>

<p>
Before writing a new ebuild, check 
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</uri> 
to see if an ebuild has already been written for the package, but has not yet 
been added to the Portage tree.  Go to <uri 
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, choose query and select 
Advanced Search; as product select <e>Gentoo Linux</e>, as component select 
<e>ebuilds</e>.  In the search field put the name of the ebuild and as status 
select NEW, ASSIGNED, REOPENED and RESOLVED (RESOLVED is important), then 
submit the query.  For you lazy people, click <uri 
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/query.cgi?product=Gentoo%20Linux&amp;component=Ebuilds&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED">here</uri>.
</p>

<p>
In general, the Portage tree should only be used for storing 
<path>.ebuild</path> files, as well as any relatively small companion
files, such as patches or sample configuration files.  These types of
files should be placed in the <path>/usr/portage/mycat/mypkg/files</path>
directory to keep the main <path>mycat/mypkg</path> directory uncluttered.
Exceptions to this rule are for larger patch files (we recommend this for patches
above 20KB) which should be put onto the Gentoo mirrors so that people
do not waste excessive amounts of bandwidth and hard drive
space. Also, you should not add binary (non-ASCII) files to the
Portage CVS tree. If you need to do this in another CVS tree, for
example, if you need to add a small PNG graphic for whatever reason,
be sure to add it to CVS by using the <c>-kb</c> option, like so:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding binary files to CVS">
# <i>cvs add -kb myphoto.png</i>
</pre>

<p>
The <c>-kb</c> option tells CVS that <path>myphoto.png</path> is a binary
file and should be treated specially.  For example, merging the 
differences between two different versions of this file should not be 
allowed to happen, for obvious reasons.  Also, speaking of merging 
changes, any patches you add to Portage should generally <e>not</e> be 
compressed.  This will allow CVS to merge changes and correctly inform 
developers of conflicts.
</p>

<p>
Remember, the packages that you commit must be <e>ready</e> <e>out of the 
box</e> for end users when committed as stable.  Make sure that you have a good 
set of default settings that will satisfy the majority of systems and 
users that will use your package.  If your package is broken, and you are 
not sure how to get it to work, check some other distributions that have 
done their own versions of the package.  You can check 
<uri link="http://cvs.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/SPECS/">Mandriva</uri>
or <uri link="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">Debian</uri> or 
<uri link="http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</uri> for some 
examples.
</p>

<p>
When committing to CVS, all developers should use <c>repoman commit</c> 
instead of <c>cvs commit</c> to submit their ebuilds.  Before committing, 
please run <c>repoman full</c> to make sure you didn't forget something.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>CVS Commit Policy</title>
<body>

<ul>
<li>Always run <c>repoman scan</c> before you commit.</li>
<li>Please run <c>repoman full</c> before you commit.</li>
<li>Always test that <path>package.mask</path> is okay by doing 
<c>emerge --pretend mypkg</c> before you commit and check 
that it doesn't contain any conflicts.</li>
<li>Always update the <path>ChangeLog</path> before you commit.</li>
<li>Always commit the updated <path>package.mask</path> before 
the updated package, in case conflicts occur while you commit 
<path>package.mask</path>.</li>
<li>Always do atomic commits; if you commit a package with a new license, 
or that is masked, then first commit the revised <path>package.mask</path> and/or license, 
then commit the ebuild, <path>ChangeLog</path>, patches
and <uri link="?part=2&amp;chap=4">metadata.xml</uri> all in <b>one</b> go
to avoid breaking users' installations.</li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>The files Directory</title>
<body>

<p>
As noted earlier, under each package subdirectory is
a <path>files/</path> directory. Any patches, configuration files, or
other ancillary files your package might require should be added to
this directory; any files bigger than 20KB-or-so should go to the
mirrors to lower the amount of (unneeded) files our users have to
download. You may want to consider naming patches you create yourself
just to get your package to build with a version-specific name, such
as <path>mypkg-1.0-gentoo.diff</path>, or more
simply, <path>1.0-gentoo.diff</path>.  Also note that the
<path>gentoo</path> extension informs people that this patch was created 
by us, the Gentoo Linux developers, rather than having been grabbed from a 
mailing list or somewhere else. Again, you should not compress these 
patches because CVS does not play well with binary files.
</p>

<p>
Consider prefixing or suffixing (such as <path>mypkg-1.0</path>) every file 
you put into the <path>files/</path> directory, so that the files used for 
each individual version on an ebuild are distinguishable from one another, and 
so that the changes between different revisions are visible.  This is generally 
a really good idea :).  You may want to use a different suffix if you wish to 
convey more meaning with the patch name.
</p>

<p>
If you have many files that should go into the <path>files/</path> directory, 
consider creating subdirectories such as <path>files/1.0/</path> and putting the
relevant files in the appropriate subdirectory.  If you use this method, 
you do not need to add version information to the names of the files, 
which is often more convenient.

<section>
<title>Ebuild scripts</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Ebuild scripts are the basis for the entire portage system.  They contain 
all the information required to download, unpack, compile and install a 
set of sources, as well as how to perform any optional pre/post 
install/removal or configuration steps.  While most of Portage is 
written in Python, the ebuild scripts themselves are written in bash, 
since using bash allows us to call commands as we would from the 
command-line.  One of the important design principles behind ebuild scripts 
is to have the commands therein be analogs of those one would type on the 
command-line if installing the package manually.  For this purpose, using 
bash syntax is a very good thing.
</p>

<p>
Ebuild scripts are interpreted by the <c>ebuild</c> and <c>emerge</c> 
commands.  Think of the <c>ebuild</c> command as a low-level building 
tool.  It can build and install a single ebuild, but no more.  It will 
check to see if dependencies are satisfied, but it will not attempt to 
auto-resolve them.  On the other hand <c>emerge</c> is a high level engine 
for <c>ebuild</c>, and has the ability to auto-merge dependencies if 
needed, perform <e>pretend</e> merges so that user can see what ebuilds 
would be merged, and more.  Generally, <c>emerge</c> blows 
<c>ebuild</c> out of the water except in one area.  With <c>ebuild</c>, 
you can incrementally step through the various parts of a package 
emerge (fetching, unpacking, compiling, installing and merging) one at a 
time.  For developers, this is an invaluable debugging tool, because it 
allows you to isolate ebuild problems to a specific portion of the ebuild.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Naming ebuild files</title>
<body>

<p>Ebuild file names consist of four logical subsections:</p>

<p><c>pkg-ver{_suf{#}}{-r#}.ebuild</c></p>

<note>The brackets (<c>{}</c>) delineate optional fields and do not appear in
the literal package name. <c>#</c> represents any non-zero positive
integer.</note>

<p>
The first subsection, <c>pkg</c>, is the package name, which should
only contain lowercase letters, the digits 0-9, and any number of
single hyphen (<c>-</c>), underscore (<c>_</c>) or plus (<c>+</c>)
characters. Examples: <c>util-linux</c>,
<c>sysklogd</c> and <c>gtk+</c>. We have some packages in Portage that 
don't follow these rules, but <e>your</e> packages should.
</p>

<p>
The second subsection, <c>ver</c>, is the version of the package,
which should normally be same as the version on the main source
tarball. The version is normally made up of two or three (or more)
numbers separated by periods, such as <c>1.2</c> or <c>4.5.2</c>, and
may have a single letter immediately following the last digit;
e.g., <c>1.4b</c> or <c>2.6h</c>. The package version is joined to the
package name with a hyphen. For example:
<c>foo-1.0</c>, <c>bar-2.4.6</c>.
</p>

<impo>
If you're thinking of using a trailing letter in your version string, note 
that the trailing letter should <e>not</e> be used to signify alpha or beta 
status for the package, since alphas and betas are <e>prereleases</e> and 
letter revisions are <e>newer versions</e>.  This is an important 
distinction because Portage uses an ebuild's version number to determine 
if it is newer or older than other packages with the same category and 
name.  It's very important that version numbers faithfully represent the 
version of the package so that Portage properly performs its dependency 
checking duties.
</impo>

<p>
The third subsection, <c>{_suf{#}}</c>, is optional may contain one of 
these predefined suffixes, listed in least-recent to most-recent order:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>Suffix</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
 <tr><ti><c>_alpha</c></ti><ti>Alpha release</ti></tr>
 <tr><ti><c>_beta</c></ti><ti>Beta release</ti></tr>
 <tr><ti><c>_pre</c></ti><ti>Prerelease</ti></tr>
 <tr><ti><c>_rc</c></ti><ti>Release candidate</ti></tr>
 <tr><ti>(none)</ti><ti>Normal release</ti></tr>
 <tr><ti><c>_p</c></ti><ti>Patch level (normally accompanied by trailing integer)</ti></tr>
</table>

<p> 
Any of these suffixes may be immediately followed by a non-zero positive
integer, e.g., <c>linux-2.4.0_pre10</c>. Assuming identical version parts, the
suffixes are ordered as follows (lower means older): <c>_alpha</c> &lt;
<c>_beta</c> &lt; <c>_pre</c> &lt; <c>_rc</c> &lt; (no suffix) &lt;
<c>_p</c>.
</p>
       
<p>
When comparing identical suffixes with trailing integers, the one with the
larger integer will be considered most recent. Example: <c>foo-1.0_alpha4</c>
is more recent than <c>foo-1.0_alpha3</c>.
</p>

<p>
The fourth subsection of the package name is the Gentoo Linux-specific revision
number (<c>{-r#}</c>). This subsection, like the suffix, is also optional.
<c>#</c> is a non-zero positive integer; e.g.,  <c>package-4.5.3-r3</c>. 
</p>

<p>
This revision number is independent of the version of the source tarball and
is used to inform people that a new and improved Gentoo Linux revision of a
particular package is available. Initial releases of ebuilds must have no
revision number; e.g., <c>package-4.5.3</c> and are considered by 
Portage to have a revision number of zero. This means that counting goes 
as follows: <c>1.0</c> (initial version), <c>1.0-r1</c>, <c>1.0-r2</c>, 
etc. 
</p>

<p>
If you make non-trivial improvements to an existing ebuild file, you 
should copy the ebuild file to a new file with the revision number 
incremented by 1. Remember to <e>always</e> make mentions of your changes in
the <path>ChangeLog</path> when you bump a revision <b>and</b> in
your CVS commit message; not doing so is against policy.
</p>

<p>
... and I suppose that we actually have a <e>fifth</e> section of the 
ebuild name as well -- the <c>.ebuild</c> extension itself.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Contents of an ebuild file</title>
<body>

<p>
This section is an introduction to ebuilds.  For the full listing of everything 
possible in an ebuild, there is a manpage which talks about the internal 
format, variables, and functions in an ebuild script: <c>man 5 ebuild</c>.
</p>

<p><b>Headers</b></p>

<p>
When you submit your ebuilds, the header should be <e>exactly</e> the same as
the one in <path>/usr/portage/header.txt</path>. Most importantly, do not
modify it in anyway and make sure that the <c>&#36;Header: &#36;</c> line is
intact.
</p>

<p>
The first three lines should look something like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Valid Header">
# Copyright 1999-2005 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# &#36;Header: &#36;
</pre>

<p><b>Variables</b></p>

<p>
The first part of every ebuild file is made up of a number of variables.  
They fall under 3 categories (and are marked below):
</p>

<ul>
<li>READ: variables you can utilize but <e>never set</e></li>
<li>MUST: variables you <e>must always set</e></li>
<li>OPT: variables that you should set</li>
</ul>

<table>

    contain the URL paths, just the filename.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>DISTDIR</c></ti>
  <ti>READ</ti>
  <ti>
    Contains the path to the <path>distfiles</path> directory where all the
    files fetched for a package are stored. Typically, this is
    <path>/usr/portage/distfiles</path>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>FILESDIR</c></ti>
  <ti>READ</ti>
  <ti>
  Contains the path to the <path>files</path> sub folder in the package specific
  location in the portage tree. Do not modify this variable.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>WORKDIR</c></ti>

  <ti>
    Base of the build root for the ebuild.  Nothing should be built outside of 
    this directory.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>S</c></ti>
  <ti>OPT</ti>
  <ti>
    The source directory for your package; commonly <c>${WORKDIR}/${P}</c>.  
    Portage will default to this value so you may not have to set it!
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>T</c></ti>
  <ti>READ</ti>
  <ti>
    The temporary directory for your package.  It is used as a virtual 
    <path>/tmp</path> directory while processing the ebuild.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>D</c></ti>
  <ti>READ</ti>
  <ti>
    The root directory that the package is installed to, treat it as the 
    virtual <path>/</path>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>SLOT</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    Portage handles different versions of the same installed programs.  If you 
    would want, say GCC 2.95 and GCC 3.2 installed at the same time, you would 
    specify the <c>SLOT</c> in each ebuild.  Here we would set the <c>SLOT</c> 
    of GCC 2.95 to <c>2</c> while we would set the <c>SLOT</c> of GCC 3.2 to 
    <c>3</c>.
    <br/>
    <b>Note</b>: Using <c>0</c> as the <c>SLOT</c> value signifies that this
    package only has 1 <c>SLOT</c> setting (in other words, this package is not
    SLOTable).
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>LICENSE</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    This variable specifies what license the program is covered under, i.e. 
    GPL-2, BSD, etc...  This field must be set to a valid license (which is 
    any license found in <path>/usr/portage/license/</path>).  If the license 
    does not already exist there, it must be added before the ebuild can be 
    added to the portage tree. If the license does not allow redistribution,
    make sure you place <c>RESTRICT</c>="nomirror" in the ebuild.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>KEYWORDS</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    This variable now supports a couple of different functions.  First
    of all, this variable specifies what architecture the ebuild is
    meant for. Some example keywords include: <e>x86, ppc, sparc,
    mips, alpha, arm, hppa, amd64 and ia64</e>. See the
    profiles/arch.list file in the Portage tree for more
    details. Obviously, you would set this to reflect the architecture
    of the target machine. Portage will not allow an x86 machine to
    build anything but x86, as specified by the <c>KEYWORDS</c>
    variable. Packages that do not support the native architecture are
    automatically masked by Portage. If the <c>KEYWORDS</c> flag has
    a preceding <e>~</e>, then that indicates that the particular
    ebuild works, but needs to be tested in several environments
    before being moved to the stable profile with the given keyword.
    If the <c>KEYWORDS</c> flag has a preceding <e>-</e>, then the
    package does not work with the given keyword.  If there is nothing
    leading <c>KEYWORDS</c>, then the package is considered stable.
    You can allow installation of these different types of packages
    through the <c>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</c> variable in
    <path>make.conf</path>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>DESCRIPTION</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>A <e>short</e>, one line description of your package.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>SRC_URI</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    The URLs for every source file in your package, separated by
    whitespace. You should try not to include version numbers in the
    SRC_URI and S. Always try to use ${PV} or ${P}, and if a version
    number is not consistant with the name of the source package, make
    a ${MY_P} variable and use that instead.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>HOMEPAGE</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    The homepage of the package. If you are unable to locate an official one, 
    try to provide a link from <uri link="http://freshmeat.net/">freshmeat.net</uri>
    or a similar package tracking site. Never refer to a variable name in
    the string; include only raw text.
  </ti>
</tr>

<p><b>Functions</b></p>

<p>
There are a number of different functions that you can define in ebuild 
files that control the building and installation process of your package.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Function</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>pkg_setup</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to perform any miscellaneous prerequisite
    tasks. This might include checking for an existing configuration
    file. If it is necessary to add users here, you must also do this
    check in <c>pkg_preinst()</c> before the package gets installed.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>pkg_nofetch</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Inform the user about required actions if for some reason (such as 
    licensing issues) the sources may not be downloaded by Portage 
    automatically.  Use this in conjunction with 
    <c>RESTRICT=&quot;fetch&quot;</c>.  
    You only should display messages in this function, never call <c>die</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_unpack</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to unpack your sources, apply patches, and run 
    auxiliary programs such as the autotools.  By default, this function 
    unpacks the packages listed in <c>A</c>.  The initial working directory is 
    defined by <c>WORKDIR</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_compile</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to configure and build the package.  The initial working 
    directory is <c>S</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_install</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to install the package to an image in <c>D</c>.  If 
    your package uses automake, you can do this simply with 
    <c>make DESTDIR=${D} install</c>.  <e>Make sure your package installs all 
    its files using <c>D</c> as the root!</e>  The initial working directory is
    <c>S</c>. 
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_test</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Executed only when <c>FEATURES="test"</c> is set
    and <c>RESTRICT="test"</c> is unset, the default of this
    function executes an available testing function from any Makefiles
    in the <c>${S}</c> directory, running either "make test" or "make
    check" depending on what is provided. It can be overriden to
    create a custom test setup.

  <ti>
    You use this function to setup an initial configuration for the package 
    after it's installed.  All paths in this function should be prefixed with 
    <c>ROOT</c> which points to user-specified install root which may not
    happen to be <path>/</path>. This function is <e>only</e> executed if and
    when the user runs: <c>emerge --config =${PF}</c>.

<p><b>Helper Functions</b></p>

<p>
You can also use the following helper functions in your ebuilds.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Function</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>use</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Check if one or more given USE-flags are defined.  If so, the
    function will echo the flags that exist in <c>USE</c>. This
    behaviour will soon change, with <c>use</c> not creating output,
    but <c>usev</c> would still create output. To check the existence
    of a USE-flag, you can use <c>use foobar</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>has_version</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Returns 1 if the system has the requested version of a certain package.  
    For instance <c>has_version >=sys-libs/glibc-2.3.0</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>best_version</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Returns <path>category/package-version</path> of the requested 
    <path>category/package</path>. For instance <c>best_version 
    x11-libs/gtk+extra</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>use_with</c></ti>
  <ti>
    This function checks if a use-flag has been defined and returns 
    &quot;--with-foobar&quot; or &quot;--without-foobar&quot; accordingly.  If 
    you only use one argument, that argument is both use-flag and 
    with(out)-string.  Otherwise the first argument is the use-flag and the 
    second argument the with(out)-string. For instance <c>use_with truetype 
    freetype</c> will echo &quot;--with-freetype&quot; if truetype is in 
    <c>USE</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>use_enable</c></ti>
  <ti>
    The same as <c>use_with</c>, but returns &quot;--enable-foobar&quot; or 
    &quot;--disable-foobar&quot; accordingly.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>check_KV</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Checks if Portage knows kernel version.  If not, display an error and 
    die.  If you need the kernel version in your script, use the <c>KV</c> 
    variable which is automatically defined by Portage.  On a system running 
    gentoo-sources-2.4.20-r6, <c>KV</c> would have the value &quot;2.4.20&quot;.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>keepdir</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Creates (if necessary) a <path>.keep</path> file in the given directory 
    so that it isn't auto-cleaned.  <e>Never</e> create a <path>.keep</path> 
    file yourself.  If portage changes how <c>keepdir</c> works, then creating 
    the file yourself will break the package.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>econf</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Issues <c>./configure</c> with the necessary path-changes (prefix, host, 
    mandir, infodir, datadir, sysconfdir, localstatedir). You can optionally 
    pass extra arguments to <c>./configure</c> by specifying them when you 
    call <c>econf</c>, and users can set the environment variable 
    <c>EXTRA_ECONF</c> if they need to. Options passed to configure
    take precedence in the reverse order that they were given. In
    other words, the first argument passed will always be overridden
    by the last.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>einstall</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Issues <c>make install</c> with the necessary path-changes (prefix, datadir,
    mandir, infodir, datadir, sysconfdir, localstatedir).  Again, you can pass 
    extra arguments to the make command by specifying them when you call 
    <c>einstall</c>.  Please note that the preferred way to install a package is
    via the <c>make install DESTDIR=${D}</c> command and not via 
    <c>einstall</c>. This command is only a fall back to override broken make 
    files.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>die</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Causes the current process to be aborted.  It will notify the user using 
    the given arguments as a reason.  Do not neglect to pass a message to 
    <c>die</c> if you have more than one call to it in a single function.  It 
    is harder to track down a failure if you're not sure <e>where</e> the 
    package failed.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>einfo</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Inform the user about something important.  The argument given to 
    <c>einfo</c> is the message that the user will see.  Do not use 
    <c>einfo</c> to display banners such as 
    &quot;*************************************&quot;.  The fact that you're 
    using <c>einfo</c> is enough to get the user's attention.

    in <c>EPATCH_OPTS</c>. The function expects either a file or a
    directory as an argument - if you specify a directory, all
    patches in the form of "??_${ARCH}_..." will be applied: for a
    patch to be applied, it needs to match the running architecture,
    have "_all_" in the name, or <c>EPATCH_FORCE</c> must be set to

<title>Rules for writing an ebuild file</title>
<body>

<p>
Since ebuild files are really just shell scripts, you should
use your editor's shell-script mode for editing them.  You should use
proper indentation, using only tab characters -- <e>no spaces</e>.  Make sure
you set up your editor to put tab stops at 4 spaces.  Always make sure
you use braces around your environment variables; e.g. <c>${P}</c>
instead of just <c>$P</c>.
</p>

<p>
Long lines are wrapped with ' \', thus:
</p>

<pre caption="Wrapping lines in ebuilds">
./configure \
--prefix=/usr || die "configure failed"
</pre>

<p>
For further details, refer to <path>skel.ebuild</path> (usually 
residing in <path>/usr/portage</path>).
</p>

<p>
If you use Vim for ebuild/eclass editing, the default Gentoo vimrc
file, <path>/etc/vim/vimrc</path>, already ensures that correct
indentation and filetype settings are used for ebuild and eclass
files. For better results, including special syntax highlighting for
ebuild keywords, emerge app-vim/gentoo-syntax.
</p>

<p>
On non-Gentoo systems, you can obtain similar results by using the
following lines in your vimrc, or better yet by installing the
<uri link="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/gentoo-syntax/">gentoo-syntax
</uri> scripts.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring vimrc for ebuild-editing">
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.e{build,class} let is_bash=1|setfiletype sh
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.e{build,class} set ts=4 sw=4 noexpandtab
</pre>

<p>
If you're using Emacs, you can put the following snippet at the bottom of 
.emacsrc file (for GNU Emacs) or init.el (for XEmacs) to make sure your using 
the correct settings when editing anything Gentoo-related.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring emacsrc for ebuild-editing">
(defun ebuild-mode ()
  (shell-script-mode)
  (sh-set-shell "bash")
  (make-local-variable 'tab-width)
  (setq tab-width 4))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ebuild$" . ebuild-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.eclass$" . ebuild-mode) auto-mode-alist))
</pre>

<p>
If you're using nano, then you're in luck!  Just edit <path>/etc/nanorc</path> 
and uncomment the section referring to ebuild's.
</p>

</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>USE Variables</title>
<body>

<p>
The purpose of USE variables is to allow you to configure Portage to globally
and automatically enable or disable certain <e>optional build-time</e>
features.  Here's an example.  Let's say you're a GNOME fan, and you'd like any
ebuild that has the option of compiling-in optional GNOME support to do
so.  In this case, you'd add <c>gnome</c> to the <c>USE</c> variable in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>, and then Portage will automatically add optional
GNOME functionality to packages if it is available.  Likewise, if you don't
want optional GNOME features to be added to your ebuilds if they are available,
simply edit <path>/etc/make.conf</path> and make sure that <c>gnome</c> is
<e>not</e> set in the <c>USE</c> variable.  Gentoo Linux has an almost
overwhelming number of USE options, allowing you to have your system configured
exactly the way you want it.
</p>

<note>
If you unset a USE variable (for example, removing <c>gnome</c> from
<c>USE</c>), this will only instruct Portage to disable <e>optional</e>
build-time support for GNOME.  However, if you <c>emerge</c> an ebuild that
<e>requires</e> GNOME, the package will obviously have GNOME support enabled, 
as you would expect.  This also means that GNOME will be automatically 
installed (as a dependency) if it hasn't been already.  That's why it's always 
a good idea to do an <c>emerge --pretend</c> before doing the &quot;real&quot; 
<c>emerge</c>; that way, you'll always know exactly what you're going to get!
</note>

<p>
In your own ebuilds, you can check whether a USE variable is set by using the 
<c>use &lt;variable&gt;</c> command.  The <c>use</c> command prints out 
<c>&lt;variable&gt;</c> if it is present in the user's <c>USE</c>.  You would 
normally use this command as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="Finding out if a USE-flag is set">
if use X; then
  # Commands specific to X...
fi
</pre>

<p>
USE variables can also be used to set dependencies. For example, you
may only want to require a package if a certain USE variable is set.
This is done by using the syntax <c>flag? ( mycat/mypackage )</c> in
the <c>DEPEND</c> variable for your ebuild.  In this
example, <c>mycat/mypackage</c> will only be required if <c>flag</c>
is present in <c>USE</c>. It is also possible to specify what
dependency should be used if some USE flag <e>is</e> set, and what
dependency to use if it is <e>not</e> set: <c>flag? (
mycat/mypackage)</c> and <c>!flag? ( othercat/otherpackage )</c>.  In
this case, if <c>flag</c> is not set, <c>othercat/otherpackage</c> is
used instead of <c>mycat/mypackage</c>. Make sure that your ebuilds
use this syntax and not Bash IFS.  Bash conditionals interfere with
Portage's dependency caching, and the use of them will break your
ebuild.
</p>

<p>
Here's an important tip about how to use <c>USE</c>. Most of the time,
a package will have a <c>./configure</c> script used to perform configuration
steps. Generally, if your ebuild uses <c>./configure</c>, any optional 
build-time functionality will be enabled or disabled by passing the appropriate
arguments to the <c>./configure</c> command.  Here's the best way to handle 
this:
</p>

<pre caption="Conditionals based on USE-settings">
DEPEND="X? ( &gt;=x11-base/xfree-4.3 )
mysql? ( &gt;=dev-db/mysql-3.23.49 )
apache2? ( &gt;=net-www/apache-2 )
!apache2? ( =net-www/apache-1* )"

src_compile() {
  econf \
    $(use_enable X x11) \
    $(use_enable mysql) \
    || die "Error: econf failed!"
  emake || die "Error: emake failed!"
}
</pre>

<p>
This approach has a very nice result.  We don't have to worry about what the 
default setting is for mysql or X (enable/disabled), we explicitly tell 
<c>econf</c> what we want it to do based upon the <c>USE</c> variable.  Not to 
mention it's quite clean in terms of readability :).
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, ebuilds will have conflicting <c>USE</c> flags for functionality.
Checking for them and returning an error is <e>not</e> a viable solution. Instead,
you must pick one of the <c>USE</c> flags in conflict to favour.

One example comes from the msmtp ebuilds. The package can use either SSL
with GnuTLS, SSL with OpenSSL, or no SSL at all. Because GnuTLS is more
featureful than OpenSSL, it is favoured:
</p>

<pre caption="Favouring conflicting USE flags">
src_compile() {
    local myconf

    if use ssl &amp;&amp; use gnutls ; then
        myconf="${myconf} --enable-ssl --with-ssl=gnutls"
    elif use ssl &amp;&amp; ! use gnutls ; then
        myconf="${myconf} --enable-ssl --with-ssl=openssl"
    else
        myconf="${myconf} --disable-ssl"
    fi

    econf \
        # Other stuff
        ${myconf} \
        || die "configure failed"

    emake || die "make failed"
}

<title>Introduction to the FHS</title>
<body>

<p>
The file system layout standards used in Gentoo Linux closely follow the FHS,
short for <e>File system Hierarchy Standard</e>.  A simplified
description of the standard is given here; for a complete
specification go to <uri>http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</uri>.
</p>

<note>
The <path>/opt</path> hierarchy is addressed in section 3.12 of the FHS.
Section 4.4 deals with the <path>/usr/X11R6</path> directory.  KDE and GNOME are
not specifically addressed, and are in fact not even mentioned in the current
version of the FHS.

<title>How to fit your packages into the file system</title>
<body>

<p>
Usually, if the package uses autoconf and automake, the 
default installation destinations are mostly correct, with a few exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you're installing a program into <path>/bin</path>, <path>/sbin</path>,
<path>/usr/bin</path>, or <path>/usr/sbin</path>, then the program's
corresponding man page should be installed into the <path>/usr/share/man</path>
tree.  This can often be accomplished by specifying a <c>./configure
--mandir=/usr/share/man</c> in the ebuild.
</li>
<li>
GNU info files should always be installed to <path>/usr/share/info</path>,
<e>even if the info files are about X11, GNOME or KDE-specific programs or
tools</e>.  Make a note: <path>/usr/share/info</path> is the <e>only</e>
official location for GNU info files.  Since many <c>./configure</c> scripts
default to installing GNU info files in <c>/usr/info</c>, it's often necessary
to call <c>./configure</c> with the <c>--infodir=/usr/share/info</c> argument.
</li>
<li>
Documentation files are installed in <path>/usr/share/doc</path>, into a
subdirectory reflecting the name, version, and revision of the particular
program.  This applies to all programs: GNOME, KDE, X11 and console alike.  
However, some programs may install additional documentation and support files
into a <path>/usr/share</path> hierarchy for their own purposes.
</li>
<li>
X11-specific programs and libraries should always be installed into 
<path>/usr</path>, not directly into <path>/usr/X11R6</path>.  We reserve the 
<path>/usr/X11R6</path> hierarchy for the X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 
<e>itself</e>.  This is perhaps a more to-the-letter interpretation of the FHS 
than some other distributions have made.
</li>
<li>
GNOME and KDE programs, similarly, should always be installed into 
<path>/usr</path>.
</li>
</ul>

<impo>
Some distributions choose to install GNOME and KDE into <path>/opt</path>. There
exists no standard for these desktop environments in terms of where to actually
install their files. In the interests of simplicity and consistency, we elect to
install all KDE and GNOME packages into the <path>/usr</path> hierarchy.
</impo>

<p>
In general, you should have ebuilds install their files into the 
<path>/usr</path> tree.  <e>Some</e> programs can be compiled and linked with 
or without GNOME, KDE, and X11 libraries, which can cause confusion.  Our 
solution is to install everything into <path>/usr</path> which avoids ambiguity 
and needless complexity for ebuild authors.  The location in which to install 
a program's files should <e>not</e> depend on the presence or absence of 
specific <c>USE</c> variables.  Therefore, the ebuilds in the portage tree 
<e>almost always</e> install into the <path>/usr</path> hierarchy exclusively.
</p>

<note>
The <path>/opt</path> directory is reserved in Gentoo Linux for binary-only 
packages. Examples include mozilla-bin, acroread, netscape and realplayer.  
Packages that get installed here will usually require a 
<path>/etc/env.d/foo</path> stub file.  This is so that paths and additional 
variables can be included into the environment.  For more information on 
<path>/etc/env.d</path>, please visit <uri 
link="/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=5">this</uri>
document.

<p>
These are scripts used by the system-administrator to install and remove

<c>ebuild</c> is the main engine of the Portage system; it performs all major 
tasks such as unpacking, compiling, installing, merging, and unmerging 
packages.  It is called using the command: <c>ebuild path/to/package.ebuild

<title>Package Dependencies</title>
<subsection>
<title>Why dependencies are important</title>
<body>

<p>
Portage is more than just a convenience script that gives you a unified
way to build any one project (program, library) from source.  It will also
fetch and install any necessary dependencies if you take care to specify
these in your ebuild.
</p>

<p>
In the official ebuilds, all dependencies have already been specified,
so when you issue <c>emerge net-www/mozilla/mozilla-1.0</c>, Portage will
insure that all libraries necessary for Mozilla to build and run are
properly installed before Mozilla itself is built.
</p>

<p>
Portage even distinguishes between build-time dependencies and run-time
dependencies. (Caveat: Currently, Portage installs all build-time and run-time
dependencies and leaves it at that. At a later stage, it will be possible to
trim your installation so that only the run-time dependencies are left 
installed).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>How to Specify Dependencies in Your ebuild Files (a.k.a. DEPEND Atoms)</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>DEPEND</c> variable inside your <path>foo-x.y.z.ebuild</path> tells 
Portage about which packages are needed to build <path>foo</path>.  The 
<c>RDEPEND</c> variable specifies which packages are needed for <path>foo</path>
to run. You only need to explicitly specify <c>RDEPEND</c>
if the ebuild's runtime dependencies are different than what you specified in
<c>DEPEND</c>; if not specified, <c>RDEPEND</c> will default to your <c>DEPEND</c>
settings. <b>Never</b> set <c>RDEPEND</c> to <c>DEPEND</c> yourself in an ebuild.
</p>

<pre caption="Depend example">
DEPEND="virtual/libc
        sys-libs/zlib"
RDEPEND="virtual/libc"
</pre>

<p>
This tells Portage that to build <path>foo-x.y.z</path>, the packages
<path>virtual/libc</path> (more on  virtuals in a bit) and 
<path>sys-libs/zlib</path> are needed.  It does not say anything about which 
version of glibc or zlib that are needed, which means "anything goes".
</p>

<p>
The "anything goes" is of course a bit scary, and will not work in the general 
case. But for central libraries like glibc, which strives very hard to be 100% 
binary compatible all the time, it actually works. For other libraries, we can 
of course specify version dependencies.
</p>

<pre caption="Version example">
&gt;=sys-apps/bar-1.2
=sys-apps/baz-1.0
</pre>

<p>
&gt;= and = do what you would expect; sys-apps/bar version 1.2 or newer is okay
(this means that sys-apps/bar-2.0 is okay), while sys-apps/baz version 1.0 is 
the only version that is accepted. For more information on the version schema of
packages, see the section above on <uri link="#doc_chap2_sect2">Naming ebuild 
Files</uri>. 
</p>

<p>
Other methods of specifying version dependencies are as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="Specifying version dependencies">
~sys-apps/qux-1.0
=sys-apps/foo-1.2*
!sys-libs/gdbm
</pre>

<p>
~sys-apps/qux-1.0 will select the newest portage revision of qux-1.0.
</p>

<p>
=sys-apps/foo-1.2* will select the newest member of the 1.2 series, but will 
ignore 1.3 and later/earlier series.  That is, foo-1.2.3 and foo-1.2.0 are both
valid, while foo-1.3.3, foo-1.3.0, and foo-1.1.0 are not.
</p>

<p>
!sys-libs/gdbm will prevent this package from being emerged while gdbm is 
already emerged.
</p>

<title>Important Notes</title>
<body>

<p>
There are many things that go wrong with the DEPEND and RDEPEND
variables. Here are some important points to follow when you write the
dependencies.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <e>Always include the CATEGORY.</e><br />
    For example, use <c>&gt;=x11-libs/gtk+-2</c> and not <c>&gt;=gtk+-2</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Do not put an asterisk (*) for &gt;= dependencies.</e><br />
    For example, it should be <c>&gt;=x11-libs/gtk+-2</c> rather than
    <c>&gt;=x11-libs/gtk+-2*</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Never depend on a meta-package.</e><br />
    So don't depend on gnome-base/gnome, always depend on the specific
    libraries like libgnome.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>One dependency per line.</e><br />
    Don't put multiple dependencies on the same line. It makes it ugly to read
    and hard to follow.
  </li>
  <li><e>GTK: Always use =x11-libs/gtk+-1.2* for GTK+1 apps.</e></li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, it is important to ensure that all the dependencies are
complete for your package:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <e>Look in configure.in or configure.ac</e><br />
    Look for checks for packages in here. Things to look out for are pkg-config
    checks or AM_* functions that check for a specific version.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Look at included .spec files</e><br />
    A good indication of dependencies is to look at the included .spec files
    for relevant deps. However, do not trust them to be the definitive complete
    list of dependencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Look at the application/library website</e><br />
    Check the application website for possible dependencies that they suggest
    are needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Read the README and INSTALL for the package</e><br />
    They usually also contain useful information about building and installing
    packages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Remember non-binary dependencies such as pkg-config, doc generation
    programs, etc.</e><br />
    Usually the build process requires some dependencies such as intltool,
    libtool, pkg-config, doxygen, scrollkeeper, gtk-doc, etc. Make sure those
    are clearly stated.

<title>ChangeLog</title>
<body>

<p>
Whenever you update (or write a new) an ebuild, you must also update its (or
create a new) ChangeLog.  The <path>skel.ChangeLog</path> contains a sample
ChangeLog that you can use as a basis.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the ChangeLog is to document <e>what</e> is being done, 
<e>why</e> it is being done, and by <e>whom</e>.  This allows both 
developers and users to trace the changes made in an easy way.
</p>

<p>
The ChangeLog is primarily targeted at users, so be sure to keep your
writing short, to the point, and avoid getting verbose about the internal
technical details.
</p>

<title>Storing your own ebuilds locally</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to be able to test your ebuilds and let Portage know about them, you 
must place those in a known directory.  Portage will use the 
<c>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</c> variable which you can define in 
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>.  You should set this variable to your directory 
(e.g. <path>/usr/local/portage</path>).
</p>

<p>
In that directory, you must use the same structure (and categories) as in 
<path>/usr/portage</path>. 
</p>

<p>
Using this <c>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</c>, your ebuilds remain on your system, even
after an <c>emerge sync</c>, and they are still known to Portage.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Testing the package</title>
<body>

<p>
Have a think about how you will test whether this package
works. Sometimes the developers have already included a <c>make test</c> or
<c>make check</c> routine that will test the basic functionality of the
package. If so, then running <c>env FEATURES=test ebuild <path>foo-x.y.z.ebuild</path>
test</c> will execute it. If it is broken try to fix it so that it works
(and submit the patch to the upstream developers).
</p>

<p>
If this is not the case consider adding a <c>src_test</c> routine to
your ebuild. This is executed before the <c>src_install</c> routine
and can be very helpful for testing the program works across various
architectures. The architecture developers will appreciate if you add
a routine here so that they do not require knowledge of the package's
functionality.
</p>

<p>
Please keep in mind the general requirements of an ebuild here. The
<c>src_test</c> routine must not be interactive. If the test routine
depends on other packages use the <c>test</c> USE flag to specify the
optional compile time <c>DEPEND</c>ancies. Also, please note that <c>src_test</c>
routines are not recommended for graphical X applications as the
user running portage often cannot run them successfully.

<p>
We have a few useful tools to help you with writing and maintaining your 
ebuilds.

</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>repoman</c></ti>
  <ti>sys-apps/portage</ti>
  <ti>
    Developer-only tool to assist with the CVS checkin procedure.  It does a 
    lot of common QA and tries to make sure that files added to cvs will not 
    break the portage tree.
  </ti>

  <ti><c>ccache</c></ti>
  <ti>dev-util/ccache</ti>
  <ti>
    Tool that keeps pre-processed files so that recompilation gets done 
    <e>much</e> faster.  Be sure to add <c>ccache</c> to the <c>FEATURES</c> 
    variable in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>!
  </ti>

  <ti><c>sandboxshell</c></ti>
  <ti>app-shells/sandboxshell</ti>
  <ti>
    Launch a shell that creates a sandbox environment.  Useful for entering the
    same environment that portage builds packages inside of and debugging 
    things by hand.
  </ti>
