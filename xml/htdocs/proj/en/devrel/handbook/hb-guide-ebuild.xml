<title>The Portage tree</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The Portage tree is typically found at <path>/usr/portage</path> and is 
organized in a hierarchical structure consisting of category directories, 
followed by specific package directories.  Here's an example; you can find
the <path>util-linux-2.11y.ebuild</path> file in the 
<path>/usr/portage/sys-apps/util-linux</path> directory.  There may be 
several other versions of <c>util-linux</c> ebuilds alongside 
<path>util-linux-2.11y.ebuild</path>.  This is because <e>all ebuilds for 
a particular package (regardless of version)</e>, share the same 
<path>mycat/mypkg</path> directory in <path>/usr/portage</path>.

<title>Checking Out the Portage Tree from CVS</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are unfamiliar with the CVS system, please read the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/cvs-tutorial.xml">CVS Tutorial</uri>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
The Portage tree can be found in the <c>gentoo-x86</c> module of the 
Gentoo Linux tree.  To check out the module (about 350 megabytes) you 
would first set up CVS via the above guide, then check out the 
<c>gentoo-x86</c> module.
</p>

<title>What (not) to put in the Portage tree</title>
<body>

<p>
Before writing any ebuild, check <uri 
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</uri> for an ebuild 
corresponding to the ebuild you want to write, but that has not yet been put 
into the Portage tree.  Go to <uri 
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, choose query; as product 
select <e>Gentoo Linux</e>, as component select <e>ebuilds</e>. In the search 
field put the name of the ebuild and as status select NEW, ASSIGNED, REOPENED 
and RESOLVED (RESOLVED is important), then submit the query.  For you lazy 
people, click <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/query.cgi?product=Gentoo%20Linux&amp;component=Ebuilds&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED">here</uri>.
</p>

<p>
In general, the Portage tree should only be used for storing 
<path>.ebuild</path> files, as well as any relatively small companion 
files, such as patches or sample configuration files.  These types of 
files should be placed in the <path>/usr/portage/mycat/mypkg/files</path> 
directory to keep the main <path>mycat/mypkg</path> directory uncluttered.  
Exceptions to this rule are for larger patch files which should be put onto 
the Gentoo mirrors so that people do not waste excessive amounts of 
bandwidth and hard drive space.  Also, in general, it's not a good idea 
for developers to add binary (non-ASCII) files to CVS.  However, if this 
is necessary (for example, if you need to add a small PNG graphic for 
whatever reason, be sure to add it to CVS by using the <c>-kb</c> option, 
like so:
</p>

<pre caption="Adding binary files to CVS">
# <i>cvs add -kb myphoto.png</i>
</pre>

<p>
The <c>-kb</c> option tells CVS that <path>myphoto.png</path> is a binary
file and should be treated specially.  For example, merging the 
differences between two different versions of this file should not be 
allowed to happen, for obvious reasons.  Also, speaking of merging 
changes, any patches you add to Portage should generally <e>not</e> be 
compressed.  This will allow CVS to merge changes and correctly inform 
developers of conflicts.
</p>

<p>
Remember, the packages that you commit must be <e>ready</e> <e>out of the 
box</e> for end users when committed as stable.  Make sure that you have a good 
set of default settings that will satisfy the majority of systems and 
users that will use your package.  If your package is broken, and you are 
not sure how to get it to work, check some other distributions that have 
done their own versions of the package.  You can check
<uri link="http://cvs.mandrakesoft.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/SPECS/">Mandrake</uri>
or <uri link="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">Debian</uri> for some 
examples.
</p>

<p>
Double-check the ebuild and cross it with the <uri
link="?part=2&amp;chap=3">Common Gentoo ebuild Mistakes</uri> section.
</p>

<p>
When committing to CVS, all developers should use <c>repoman commit</c> 
instead of <c>cvs commit</c> to submit their ebuilds.  Before committing, 
please run <c>repoman full</c> to make sure you didn't forget something.
</p>

<title>CVS Commit Policy</title>
<body>

<ul>
<li>Always run <c>repoman scan</c> before you commit.</li>
<li>Please run <c>repoman full</c> before you commit.</li>
<li>Always test that <path>package.mask</path> is okay by doing 
<c>emerge --pretend mypkg</c> before you commit and check 
that it doesn't contain any conflicts.</li>
<li>Always update the <path>ChangeLog</path> before you commit.</li>
<li>Always commit the updated <path>package.mask</path> before 
the updated package, in case conflicts occur while you commit 
<path>package.mask</path>.</li>
<li>Always do atomic commits; if you commit a package with a new license, 
or that is masked, then first commit the revised <path>package.mask</path>, 
then commit the ebuild, <path>ChangeLog</path> and license all in _one_ go, 
unless you want to break the users' installations.</li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>The files Directory</title>
<body>

<p>
As noted earlier, under each package subdirectory is a <path>files/</path>
directory.  Any patches, configuration files, or other ancillary files 
your package might require should be added to this directory. You may want 
to consider naming patches you create yourself just to get your package to 
build with a version-specific name, such as <path>mypkg-1.0-gentoo.diff</path>, 
or more simply, <path>1.0-gentoo.diff</path>.  Also note that the 
<path>gentoo</path> extension informs people that this patch was created 
by us, the Gentoo Linux developers, rather than having been grabbed from a 
mailing list or somewhere else.  Again, you should not compress these 
diffs because CVS does not play well with binary files.
</p>

<p>
Consider prefixing or suffixing (such as <path>mypkg-1.0</path>) every file 
you put into the <path>files/</path> directory, so that the files used for 
each individual version on an ebuild are distinguishable from one another, and 
so that the changes between different revisions are visible.  This is generally 
a really good idea :).  You may want to use a different suffix if you wish to 
convey more meaning with the patch name.
</p>

<p>
If you have many files that should go into the <path>files/</path> directory, 
consider creating subdirectories such as <path>files/1.0/</path> and putting the
relevant files in the appropriate subdirectory.  If you use this method, 
you do not need to add version information to the names of the files, 
which is often more convenient.

<section>
<title>Ebuild scripts</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Ebuild scripts are the basis for the entire portage system.  They contain 
all the information required to download, unpack, compile and install a 
set of sources, as well as how to perform any optional pre/post 
install/removal or configuration steps.  While most of Portage is 
written in Python, the ebuild scripts themselves are written in bash, 
since using bash allows us to call commands as we would from the 
command-line.  One of the important design principles behind ebuild scripts 
is to have the commands therein be analogs of those one would type on the 
command-line if installing the package manually.  For this purpose, using 
bash syntax is a very good thing.
</p>

<p>
Ebuild scripts are interpreted by the <c>ebuild</c> and <c>emerge</c> 
commands.  Think of the <c>ebuild</c> command as a low-level building 
tool.  It can build and install a single ebuild, but no more.  It will 
check to see if dependencies are satisfied, but it will not attempt to 
auto-resolve them.  On the other hand <c>emerge</c> is a high level engine 
for <c>ebuild</c>, and has the ability to auto-merge dependencies if 
needed, perform <e>pretend</e> merges so that user can see what ebuilds 
would be merged, and more.  Generally, <c>emerge</c> blows 
<c>ebuild</c> out of the water except in one area.  With <c>ebuild</c>, 
you can incrementally step through the various parts of a package 
emerge (fetching, unpacking, compiling, installing and merging) one at a 
time.  For developers, this is an invaluable debugging tool, because it 
allows you to isolate ebuild problems to a specific portion of the ebuild.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Naming ebuild files</title>
<body>

<p>
Ebuild file names consist of four logical sections:
</p>

<p>
The first section is the package name, which should only contain
lowercase letters, the digits 0-9, and any number of single hyphen
('-'), underscore ('_') or plus ('+') characters.  Some examples
are <c>util-linux</c>, <c>sysklogd</c>, <c>mod_php</c>,
and <c>gtk+</c>.
</p>

<p>
The second section is the version of the package, which should normally be
same as the version on the main source tarball. The version is normally 
made up of two or three numbers separated by periods, such as <c>1.2</c> 
or <c>4.5.2</c> (although very long period-separated number sequences 
<e>are</e> supported), and may have a single letter immediately following 
the last digit; e.g., <c>1.4b</c> or <c>2.6h</c>.  The package version is 
joined to the package name with a hyphen; for example: <c>foo-1.0</c>, 
<c>bar-2.4.6</c>, etc.
</p>

<impo>
If you're thinking of using a trailing letter in your version string, note 
that the trailing letter should <e>not</e> be used to signify alpha or beta 
status for the package, since alphas and betas are <e>prereleases</e> and 
letter revisions are <e>newer versions</e>.  This is an important 
distinction because Portage uses an ebuild's version number to determine 
if it is newer or older than other packages with the same category and 
name.  It's very important that version numbers faithfully represent the 
version of the package so that Portage properly performs its dependency 
checking duties.
</impo>

<p>
The third (optional) section contains a special suffix; either 
<c>_alpha</c>, <c>_beta</c>, <c>_pre</c> (pre-release), <c>_rc</c> (release 
candidate), or <c>_p</c> (patch).  Any of these suffixes may be immediately 
followed my a number; e.g., <c>linux-2.4.0_pre10</c>; Assuming identical 
version parts, an <c>_alpha</c> package is older than <c>_beta</c>, <c>_beta</c>
older than <c>_pre</c>, <c>_pre</c> older than <c>_rc</c>, and <c>_rc</c> older
than no suffix, no suffix older than any <c>_p</c>. This section is meant to 
reflect upstream versions only.
</p>

<note>
An <c>_rc</c> package is older than a package without an underscore suffix 
(i.e. <c>linux-2.4.0</c>), and <c>linux-2.4.0</c> is older than a package 
with a single letter suffix, i.e. <c>linux-2.4.0b</c>.  As you would 
expect, the <c>linux-2.4.0b</c> package is considered older than 
<c>linux-2.4.0c</c>.  Again this version information is important, as 
Portage uses it internally to determine whether one package or ebuild is 
newer than another with the same category and name.
</note>

<p>
The fourth (optional) section of the package name is the Gentoo 
Linux-specific <e>revision</e> number, which is specified by <c>-r#</c>, 
where <c>#</c> is an integer, e.g. <c>package-4.5.3-r3</c>.  This revision 
number is independent of the version of the source tarball and is used to 
inform people that a new and improved Gentoo Linux rev of a particular 
package is available.
</p>

<p>
If you make non-trivial improvements to an existing ebuild file, you 
should copy the ebuild file to a new file with the revision number 
incremented by 1.  Initial releases normally have no revision number, e.g.
<path>package-4.5.3</path>, and are considered by Portage to have a a 
revision number of zero.  This means that counting goes as follows: 
<c>1.0</c> (initial version), <c>1.0-r1</c>, <c>1.0-r2</c>, etc.  Remember 
to <e>always</e> make mentions of your changes in the <path>ChangeLog</path>. 
You are in serious trouble if you do not do this, your CVS access may be 
revoked.
</p>

<p>
... and I suppose that we actually have a <e>fifth</e> section of the 
ebuild name -- the <c>.ebuild</c> extension itself.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Contents of an ebuild file</title>
<body>

<note>
This section is an introduction to ebuilds.  For the full listing of everything 
possible in an ebuild, there is a manpage which talks about the internal 
format, variables, and functions in an ebuild script: <c>man 5 ebuild</c>.
</note>

<p><b>Variables</b></p>

<p>
The first part of every ebuild file is made up of a number of variables.  
They fall under 3 categories (and are marked below with these numbers):
</p>

<ul>
<li>READ: variables you can utilize but <e>never set</e></li>
<li>MUST: variables you <e>must always set</e></li>
<li>OPT: variables that you should set</li>
</ul>

    <path>/tmp</path> directory while processing the ebuild.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>D</c></ti>
  <ti>READ</ti>

    The root directory that the package is installed to, treat it as the 
    virtual <path>/</path>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>SLOT</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    Portage handles different versions of the same installed programs.  If you 
    would want, say GCC 2.95 and GCC 3.2 installed at the same time, you would 
    specify the <c>SLOT</c> in each ebuild.  Here we would set the <c>SLOT</c> 
    of GCC 2.95 to <c>2</c> while we would set the <c>SLOT</c> of GCC 3.2 to 
    <c>3</c>.
    <br/>
    <b>Note</b>: Using <c>0</c> as the <c>SLOT</c> value signifies that this
    package only has 1 <c>SLOT</c> setting (in other words, this package is not
    SLOTable).
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>LICENSE</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    This variable specifies what license the program is covered under, i.e. 
    GPL-2, BSD, etc...  This field must be set to a valid license (which is 
    any license found in <path>/usr/portage/license/</path>).  If the license 
    does not already exist there, it must be added before the ebuild can be 
    added to the portage tree.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>KEYWORDS</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    This variable now supports a couple of different functions.  First of all, 
    this variable specifies what architecture the ebuild is meant for.  These 
    keywords include: <e>x86, ppc, sparc, mips, alpha, arm, hppa, amd64, 
    ia64</e>. Obviously, you would set this to reflect the architecture of the 
    target machine.  Portage will not allow an x86 machine to build anything 
    but x86, as specified by the <c>KEYWORDS</c> variable.  Packages that do 
    no support the native architecture are automatically masked by Portage.  
    If the <c>KEYWORDS</c> flag has a preceding <e>~</e>, then that indicates 
    that the particular ebuild works, but needs to be tested in several 
    environments before being moved to the stable profile with the given 
    keyword.  If the <c>KEYWORDS</c> flag has a preceding <e>-</e>, then 
    the package does not work with the given keyword.  If there is nothing 
    leading <c>KEYWORDS</c>, then the package is considered stable.  You can 
    allow installation of these different types of packages through the 
    <c>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</c> variable in <path>make.conf</path>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>DESCRIPTION</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>A <e>short</e>, one line description of your package.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>SRC_URI</c></ti>
  <ti>MUST</ti>
  <ti>
    The URLs for every source file in your package, separated by whitespace.  
    Normally the first one is something like 
    &quot;ftp://ftp.company.com/pub/somepackage/${P}.tar.bz2&quot;
  </ti>

    tracking site.

<p><b>Functions</b></p>

<p>
There are a number of different functions that you can define in ebuild 
files that control the building and installation process of your package.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Function</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>pkg_setup</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to perform any miscellaneous prerequisite
    tasks. This might include checking for an existing configuration
    file. If it is necessary to add users here, you must also do this
    check in <c>pkg_preinst()</c> before the package gets installed.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>pkg_nofetch</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Inform the user about required actions if for some reason (such as 
    licensing issues) the sources may not be downloaded by Portage 
    automatically.  Use this in conjunction with 
    <c>RESTRICT=&quot;fetch&quot;</c>.  
    You only should display messages in this function, never call <c>die</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_unpack</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to unpack your sources, apply patches, and run 
    auxiliary programs such as the autotools.  By default, this function 
    unpacks the packages listed in <c>A</c>.  The initial working directory is 
    defined by <c>WORKDIR</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_compile</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function to configure and build the package.  The initial working 
    directory is <c>S</c>.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_install</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Use this function install the package to an image in <c>D</c>.  If 
    your package uses automake, you can do this simply with 
    <c>make DESTDIR=${D} install</c>.  <e>Make sure your package installs all 
    its files using <c>D</c> as the root!</e>  The initial working directory is
    <c>S</c>. 
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>src_test</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Executed only when <c>FEATURES="maketest"</c> is set
    and <c>RESTRICT="maketest"</c> is unset, the default of this
    function executes an available testing function from any Makefiles
    in the <c>${S}</c> directory, running either "make test" or "make
    check" depending on what is provided. It can be overriden to
    create a custom test setup.
  </ti>

  <ti><c>pkg_config</c></ti>
  <ti>
    You use this function to setup an initial configuration for the package 
    after it's installed.  All paths in this function should be prefixed with

<p><b>Helper Functions</b></p>

<p>
You can also use the following helper functions in your ebuilds.
</p>

<table>

  <ti><c>use</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Check if one or more given USE-flags are defined.  If so, the
    function will echo the flags that exist in <c>USE</c>. This
    behaviour will soon change, with <c>use</c> not creating output,

    you only use one argument, that argument is both use-flag and 
    with(out)-string.  Otherwise the first argument is the use-flag and the 
    second argument the with(out)-string. For instance <c>use_with truetype

<title>Rules for writing an ebuild file</title>
<body>

<p>
Since ebuild files are really just shell scripts, you should
use your editor's shell-script mode for editing them.  You should use
proper indentation, using only tab characters -- <e>no spaces</e>.  Make sure
you set up your editor to put tab stops at 4 spaces.  Always make sure
you use braces around your environment variables; e.g. <c>${P}</c>
instead of just <c>$P</c>.
</p>

<p>
Long lines are wrapped with ' \', thus:
</p>

<pre caption="Wrapping lines in ebuilds">
./configure \
--prefix=/usr || die "configure failed"
</pre>

<p>
For further details, refer to <path>skel.ebuild</path> (usually 
residing in <path>/usr/portage</path>).
</p>

<p>
If you're using Vim, you can put the following snippet at the bottom
of your .vimrc to make sure you're using the right settings when editing
anything Gentoo-related.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring vimrc for ebuild-editing">
if (getcwd() =~ 'gentoo-x86\|gentoo-src\|portage')
  set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 noexpandtab
endif
</pre>

<p>
If you're using Emacs, you can put the following snippet at the bottom of 
.emacsrc file (for GNU Emacs) or init.el (for XEmacs) to make sure your using 
the correct settings when editing anything Gentoo-related.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring emacsrc for ebuild-editing">
(defun ebuild-mode ()
  (shell-script-mode)
  (sh-set-shell "bash")
  (make-local-variable 'tab-width)
  (setq tab-width 4))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ebuild$" . ebuild-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.eclass$" . ebuild-mode) auto-mode-alist))
</pre>

<p>
If you're using nano, then you're in luck!  Just edit <path>/etc/nanorc</path> 
and uncomment the section referring to ebuild's.

<subsection>
<title>USE Variables</title>
<body>

<p>
The purpose of USE variables is to allow you to configure Portage to globally
and automatically enable or disable certain <e>optional build-time</e>
features.  Here's an example.  Let's say you're a GNOME fan, and you'd like any
ebuild that has the option of compiling-in optional GNOME support to do
so.  In this case, you'd add <c>gnome</c> to the <c>USE</c> variable in
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>, and then Portage will automatically add optional
GNOME functionality to packages if it is available.  Likewise, if you don't
want optional GNOME features to be added to your ebuilds if they are available,
simply edit <path>/etc/make.conf</path> and make sure that <c>gnome</c> is
<e>not</e> set in the <c>USE</c> variable.  Gentoo Linux has an almost
overwhelming number of USE options, allowing you to have your system configured
exactly the way you want it.
</p>

<note>
If you unset a USE variable (for example, removing <c>gnome</c> from
<c>USE</c>), this will only instruct Portage to disable <e>optional</e>
build-time support for GNOME.  However, if you <c>emerge</c> an ebuild that
<e>requires</e> GNOME, the package will obviously have GNOME support enabled, 
as you would expect.  This also means that GNOME will be automatically 
installed (as a dependency) if it hasn't been already.  That's why it's always 
a good idea to do an <c>emerge --pretend</c> before doing the &quot;real&quot; 
<c>emerge</c>; that way, you'll always know exactly what you're going to get!
</note>

<p>
In your own ebuilds, you can check whether a USE variable is set by using the 
<c>use &lt;variable&gt;</c> command.  The <c>use</c> command prints out 
<c>&lt;variable&gt;</c> if it is present in the user's <c>USE</c>.  You would 
normally use this command as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="Finding out if a USE-flag is set">
if use X; then
  # Commands specific to X...
fi
</pre>

<p>
USE variables can also be used to set dependencies.  For example, you may
only want to require a package if a certain USE variable is set.  This is done
by using the syntax <c>variable? ( mycat/mypackage )</c> in the <c>DEPEND</c>
variable for your ebuild.  In this example, <c>mycat/mypackage</c> will
only be required if <c>variable</c> is present in <c>USE</c>.  It is also
possible to specify what dependency should be used if some useflag is
set, and what dependency to use if it is <e>not</e> set: <c>variable? ( 
mycat/mypackage) : ( othercat/otherpackage )</c>.  In this case, if 
<c>variable</c> is not set, <c>othercat/otherpackage</c> is used instead 
of <c>mycat/mypackage</c>.  Finally, you can also specify a dependency in 
case a certain variable is <e>not</e> set.  Just prefix the variable with
&quot;!&quot;, like this: <c>!variable? ( mycat/mypackage )</c>.  Make sure 
that your ebuilds use this syntax and not Bash IFS.  Bash conditionals 
interfere with Portage's dependency caching, and the use of them will 
ultimately break your ebuild.
</p>

<p>
Here's an important tip about how to use <c>USE</c>.  Most of the time,
a package will have a <c>./configure</c> script used to perform configuration
steps.  Generally, if your ebuild uses <c>./configure</c>, any optional 
build-time functionality will be enabled or disabled by passing the appropriate
arguments to the <c>./configure</c> command.  Here's the best way to handle 
this:
</p>

<pre caption="Conditionals based on USE-settings">
DEPEND="X? ( &gt;=x11-base/xfree-4.3 )
mysql? ( &gt;=dev-db/mysql-3.23.49 )
apache2? ( &gt;=net-www/apache-2 ) : ( =net-www/apache-1* )"

src_compile() {
  econf \
    `use_enable X x11` \
    `use_enable mysql` \
    || die "configure failed"
  emake || die "emake failed"
}
</pre>

<p>
This approach has a very nice result.  We don't have to worry about what the 
default setting is for mysql or X (enable/disabled), we explicitly tell 
<c>econf</c> what we want it to do based upon the <c>USE</c> variable.  Not to 
mention it's quite clean in terms of readability :).

<title>File system Locations</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction to the FHS</title>
<body>

<p>
The file system layout standards used in Gentoo Linux closely follow the FHS,
short for <e>File system Hierarchy Standard</e>.  A simplified
description of the standard is given here; for a complete
specification go to <uri>http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</uri>.
</p>

<note>
The <path>/opt</path> hierarchy is addressed in section 3.12 of the FHS.
Section 4.4 deals with the <path>/usr/X11R6</path> directory.  KDE and GNOME are
not specifically addressed, and are in fact not even mentioned in the current
version of the FHS.
</note>

<subsection>
<title>How to fit your packages into the file system</title>
<body>

<p>
Usually, if the package uses autoconf and automake, the 
default installation destinations are mostly correct, with a few exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you're installing a program into <path>/bin</path>, <path>/sbin</path>,
<path>/usr/bin</path>, or <path>/usr/sbin</path>, then the program's
corresponding man page should be installed into the <path>/usr/share/man</path>
tree.  This can often be accomplished by specifying a <c>./configure
--mandir=/usr/share/man</c> in the ebuild.
</li>
<li>
GNU info files should always be installed to <path>/usr/share/info</path>,
<e>even if the info files are about X11, GNOME or KDE-specific programs or
tools</e>.  Make a note: <path>/usr/share/info</path> is the <e>only</e>
official location for GNU info files.  Since many <c>./configure</c> scripts
default to installing GNU info files in <c>/usr/info</c>, it's often necessary
to call <c>./configure</c> with the <c>--infodir=/usr/share/info</c> argument.
</li>
<li>
Documentation files are installed in <path>/usr/share/doc</path>, into a
subdirectory reflecting the name, version, and revision of the particular
program.  This applies to all programs: GNOME, KDE, X11 and console alike.  
However, some programs may install additional documentation and support files
into a <path>/usr/share</path> hierarchy for their own purposes.
</li>
<li>
X11-specific programs and libraries should always be installed into 
<path>/usr</path>, not directly into <path>/usr/X11R6</path>.  We reserve the 
<path>/usr/X11R6</path> hierarchy for the X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 
<e>itself</e>.  This is perhaps a more to-the-letter interpretation of the FHS 
than some other distributions have made.
</li>
<li>
GNOME and KDE programs, similarly, should always be installed into 
<path>/usr</path>.
</li>
</ul>

<impo>
Some distributions choose to install GNOME and KDE into <path>/opt</path>. There
exists no standard for these desktop environments in terms of where to actually
install their files. In the interests of simplicity and consistency, we elect to
install all KDE and GNOME packages into the <path>/usr</path> hierarchy.
</impo>

<p>
In general, you should have ebuilds install their files into the 
<path>/usr</path> tree.  <e>Some</e> programs can be compiled and linked with 
or without GNOME, KDE, and X11 libraries, which can cause confusion.  Our 
solution is to install everything into <path>/usr</path> which avoids ambiguity 
and needless complexity for ebuild authors.  The location in which to install 
a program's files should <e>not</e> depend on the presence or absence of 
specific <c>USE</c> variables.  Therefore, the ebuilds in the portage tree 
<e>almost always</e> install into the <path>/usr</path> hierarchy exclusively.
</p>

<note>
The <path>/opt</path> directory is reserved in Gentoo Linux for binary-only 
packages. Examples include mozilla-bin, acroread, netscape and realplayer.  
Packages that get installed here will usually require a 
<path>/etc/env.d/foo</path> stub file.  This is so that paths and additional 
variables can be included into the environment.  For more information on 
<path>/etc/env.d</path>, please visit <uri 
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=6">this</uri>

<title>Package Dependencies</title>
<subsection>
<title>Why dependencies are important</title>
<body>

<p>
Portage is more than just a convenience script that gives you a unified
way to build any one project (program, library) from source.  It will also
fetch and install any necessary dependencies if you take care to specify
these in your ebuild.
</p>

<p>
In the official ebuilds, all dependencies have already been specified,
so when you issue <c>emerge net-www/mozilla/mozilla-1.0</c>, Portage will
insure that all libraries necessary for Mozilla to build and run are
properly installed before Mozilla itself is built.
</p>

<p>
Portage even distinguishes between build-time dependencies and run-time
dependencies. (Caveat: Currently, Portage installs all build-time and run-time
dependencies and leaves it at that. At a later stage, it will be possible to
trim your installation so that only the run-time dependencies are left 
installed).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>How to Specify Dependencies in Your ebuild Files (a.k.a. DEPEND Atoms)</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>DEPEND</c> variable inside your <path>foo-x.y.z.ebuild</path> tells 
Portage about which packages are needed to build <path>foo</path>.  The 
<c>RDEPEND</c> variable specifies which packages are needed for <path>foo</path>
to run.
</p>

<pre caption="Depend example">
DEPEND="virtual/glibc
        sys-libs/zlib"
RDEPEND="virtual/glibc"
</pre>

<p>
This tells Portage that to build <path>foo-x.y.z</path>, the packages
<path>virtual/glibc</path> (more on  virtuals in a bit) and 
<path>sys-libs/zlib</path> are needed.  It does not say anything about which 
version of glibc or zlib that are needed, which means "anything goes".
</p>

<p>
The "anything goes" is of course a bit scary, and will not work in the general 
case. But for central libraries like glibc, which strives very hard to be 100% 
binary compatible all the time, it actually works. For other libraries, we can 
of course specify version dependencies.
</p>

<pre caption="Version example">
&gt;=sys-apps/bar-1.2
=sys-apps/baz-1.0
</pre>

<p>
&gt;= and = do what you would expect; sys-apps/bar version 1.2 or newer is okay
(this means that sys-apps/bar-2.0 is okay), while sys-apps/baz version 1.0 is 
the only version that is accepted. For more information on the version schema of
packages, see the section above on <uri link="#doc_chap2_sect2">Naming ebuild 
Files</uri>. 
</p>

<p>
Other methods of specifying version dependencies are as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="Specifying version dependencies">
~sys-apps/qux-1.0
=sys-apps/foo-1.2*
!sys-libs/gdbm
</pre>

<p>
~sys-apps/qux-1.0 will select the newest portage revision of qux-1.0.
</p>

<p>
=sys-apps/foo-1.2* will select the newest member of the 1.2 series, but will 
ignore 1.3 and later/earlier series.  That is, foo-1.2.3 and foo-1.2.0 are both
valid, while foo-1.3.3, foo-1.3.0, and foo-1.1.0 are not.
</p>

<p>
!sys-libs/gdbm will prevent this package from being emerged while gdbm is 
already emerged.
</p>

<note>
For all the latest details about these DEPEND Atoms, please see the section 5 
manpage on ebuilds: <c>man 5 ebuild</c>.

<title>Testing and deploying</title>
<subsection>
<title>ChangeLog</title>
<body>

<p>
Whenever you update a (or write a new) ebuild, you must also update its (or
create a new) ChangeLog.  The <path>skel.ChangeLog</path> contains a sample
ChangeLog that you can use as a basis.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the ChangeLog is to document <e>what</e> is being done, 
<e>why</e> it is being done, and by <e>whom</e>.  This allows both 
developers and users to trace the changes made in an easy way.
</p>

<p>
The ChangeLog is primarily targeted at users, so be sure to keep your
writing short, to the point, and avoid getting verbose about the internal
technical details.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Storing your own ebuilds locally</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to be able to test your ebuilds and let Portage know about them, you 
must place those in a known directory.  Portage will use the 
<c>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</c> variable which you can define in 
<path>/etc/make.conf</path>.  You should set this variable to your directory 
(e.g. <path>/usr/local/portage</path>).
</p>

<p>
In that directory, you must use the same structure (and categories) as in 
<path>/usr/portage</path>. 
</p>

<p>
Using this <c>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</c>, your ebuilds remain on your system, even
after an <c>emerge sync</c>, and they are still known to Portage.
</p>
