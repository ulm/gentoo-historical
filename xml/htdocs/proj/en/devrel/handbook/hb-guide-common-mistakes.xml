<title>Common Ebuild Writing Mistakes</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Here is a list of common ebuild mistakes that are common in
user-submitted ebuilds. Please make sure the ebuilds you submit don't
violate any of these. Before submitting any ebuilds, make sure you
read the <uri link="?part=3&amp;chap=1">Gentoo ebuild Development
Policy</uri> and the <uri link="?part=2&amp;chap=1">Gentoo
ebuild HOWTO</uri>. Also, make sure you read a couple (eg. more than
one or two) of the ebuilds in the tree to make sure you know the style
that ebuilds are written in.
</p>

<p>
Also it would be useful to read a couple of ebuilds that use eclasses and
understand how to use them by reading the <uri
link="?part=2&amp;chap=2">Eclass HOWTO</uri>. Finally, you must read the
<uri link="/doc/en/ebuild-submit.xml">Contributing Ebuilds Guide</uri> carefully
before submitting your ebuild(s).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Missing/Invalid/Broken Header</title>
<body>

<p>
When you submit your ebuilds, the header should be <e>exactly</e> the same as
the one in <path>/usr/portage/skel.ebuild</path>. Most importantly, do not
modify it in anyway and make sure that the <c>&#36;Header: &#36;</c> line is 
intact.
</p>

<p>
The first three lines <e>must</e> look like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Valid Header">
# Copyright 1999-2004 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# &#36;Header: &#36;
</pre>

<p>
Only if you are submitting a patched or version bumped ebuild, should you not
need to modify the <c>&#36;Header: &#36;</c> line. But the line must be present.
When we check the ebuild into CVS, it will modify that header with the 
appropriate version and date information. So there is no need for you to 
manually modify it.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>IUSE Missing</title>
<body>

<p>
By far the most common omission is the IUSE variable. You must (according to the
<uri link="?part=2&amp;chap=1">Gentoo ebuild HOWTO</uri>) include the IUSE
variable even if there are no USE flags in use. If there are no USE flags
supported, then just add the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Empty IUSE">
IUSE=""
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Redefined P, PV, PN, PF</title>
<body>

<p>
You should never redefine those variables. Always use MY_P, MY_PN, MY_PV,
P0, etc. See other ebuilds that do it in portage for more information. Most
ebuilds use bash "Parameter Expansion". Please read the man page for bash to
understand how "Parameter Expansion" works.
</p>

<p>
By the way, if you find a package that re-defines it, don't copy it. Submit a
bug about that ebuild.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Including version numbers in SRC_URI and S</title>
<body>

<p>
You should try not to include version numbers in the SRC_URI and S. Always try
to use ${PV} or ${P}. It makes maintaining the ebuild much easier. If a version
number is not consistant with the tarball/source, then use MY_P. An example
dev-python/pyopenal fetches a tarball called PyOpenAL, so we redefine it like:
</p>

<pre caption="Example versioning redefinition">
MY_P=${P/pyopenal/PyOpenAL}
SRC_URI="http://oomadness.tuxfamily.org/downloads/${MY_P}.tar.gz"
S=${WORKDIR}/${MY_P}
</pre>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>DEPEND has syntactical errors</title>
<body>

<p>
There are many things that go wrong with user submitted DEPEND and RDEPEND
fields. Here are some important points to follow when you write the dependency
part.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <e>Always include the CATEGORY.</e><br />
    For example, use <c>&gt;=x11-libs/gtk+-2</c> and not <c>&gt;=gtk+-2</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Do not put an asterisk (*) for &gt;= dependencies.</e><br />
    For example, it should be <c>&gt;=x11-libs/gtk+-2</c> rather than
    <c>&gt;=x11-libs/gtk+-2*</c>.
  </li>
  <li><e>GTK specific. Always use =x11-libs/gtk+-1.2* for GTK+1 apps.</e></li>
  <li>
    <e>Never depend on a meta package.</e><br />
    So don't depend on gnome-base/gnome, always depend on the specific
    libraries like libgnome.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>One dependency per line.</e><br />
    Don't put multiple dependency on the same line. It makes it ugly to read 
    and hard to follow.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>DEPEND is incomplete</title>
<body>

<p>
This is another very common error. The ebuild submitter submits and ebuild
that "just works" without checking if the dependencies are correct. Here are
some tips on how to find the correct dependencies.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <e>Look in configure.in or configure.ac</e><br />
    Look for checks for packages in here. Things to look out for are pkg-config
    checks or AM_* functions that check for a specific version.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Look at included .spec files</e><br />
    A good indication of dependencies is to look at the included .spec files
    for relevant deps. However, do not trust them to be the definitive complete
    list of dependencies
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Look at the application/library website</e><br />
    Check the application website for possible dependencies that they suggest
    are needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Read the README and INSTALL for the package</e><br />
    They usually also contain useful information about building and installing
    packages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <e>Remember non-binary dependencies such as pkg-config, doc generation
    programs, etc.</e><br />
    Usually the build process requires some dependencies such as intltool,
    libtool, pkg-config, doxygen, scrollkeeper, gtk-doc, etc. Make sure those
    are clearly stated.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>LICENSE Invalid</title>
<body>

<p>
Another common mistake users make when submitting ebuilds is supplying an
invalid license. For example, <c>GPL</c> is not a valid license. You need to 
specify <c>GPL-1</c> or <c>GPL-2</c>. Same with <c>LGPL</c>. Make sure the 
license you use in the <c>LICENSE</c> field is something that exists in 
<path>/usr/portage/licenses</path>. As a tip, check the <path>COPYING</path> 
in a source tarball for the license. If a package does not specify it
uses <c>GPL-1</c> or <c>GPL-2</c>, it is very likely it uses <c>GPL-2</c>.
</p>

<p>
If the license for the package you submit is unique and not in
<path>/usr/portage/licenses/</path>, then you must submit the new license in a 
separate file.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Untested ARCHs in KEYWORDS</title>
<body>

<p>
Please do not add other ARCHs into KEYWORDS unless the ebuild has been tested on
that ARCH. Also all new ebuilds should be ~x86 or whatever architecture it is.
Make sure when you bump a version, the stable KEYWORDS are all marked as
<c>~</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>SLOT missing</title>
<body>

<p>
Make sure you have the SLOT variable in the ebuild. If you don't plan to use it,
don't remove it. Put in:
</p>

<pre caption="Default SLOT variable">
SLOT="0"
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>DESCRIPTION and HOMEPAGE wrong</title>
<body>

<p>
Please check the if the HOMEPAGE variable is right and leads users to the right
page if they want to find out more about the package. And make sure the
DESCRIPTION is not overly long. Good descriptions will describe the main
function of the package in a sentence.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Wrongfully used spaces instead of TABS</title>
<body>

<p>
It is no fun reformatting lines of ebuilds because the submitter did not follow
the guidelines to use TABS rather than spaces. So <e>please</e> use tabs!
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Trailing whitespace</title>
<body>

<p>
I'm often guilty of this. Remember to run repoman over your ebuilds so it can
tell you if there is trailing whitespace at the end of lines or on empty lines.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Adding redundant S=${WORKDIR}/${P}</title>
<body>

<p>
If <c>S=${WORKDIR}/${P}</c>, then you should not add it to your ebuild. This is 
implied already, you should only add it if it is something other than 
<c>${WORKDIR}/${P}</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Documentation missing</title>
<body>

<p>
If your package has documentation, make sure you install it using <c>dodoc</c> 
or in <path>/usr/share/doc/${PF}</path>. Remember to check for errors when 
running <c>dodoc</c>/<c>doins</c>.
</p>

</body>

<title>Common Ebuild Submission Mistakes</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Please submit ebuilds properly by following the <uri
link="/doc/en/ebuild-submit.xml">Contributing Ebuild HOWTO</uri> on the <uri
link="/doc/en/index.xml">Gentoo Docs Page</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Tarball'ing an ebuild</title>
<body>

<p>
Please please please do not attach ebuilds as tarballs. Attach patches
seperately as well so we can easily examine them.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Inlining Ebuilds</title>
<body>

<p>
Don't cut and paste an ebuild into bugzilla's comment field.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>No description on what the package is</title>
<body>

<p>
Please let us know what the package is, and fill in the URL with the home page
of the application, if any exists.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Package updates without changing the description</title>
<body>

<p>
If you submit a package update, then make sure you explain what changes you made
to the ebuild. For example if a package introduces a new features/option and you
use a USE flag, list it in your bug. Don't make us hunt for it.
</p>

<p>
It is wise to submit a diff for a package update rather than the whole ebuild.
The best way to generate it would be:
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a diff">
$ <i>diff -u some-package-0.1.0.ebuild some-package-0.2.0.ebuild &gt; ~/some-package-0.2.0.diff</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Submitting unchanged ebuilds for version bumps</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are submitting a new version for a package in portage, make sure the
existing ebuild works and make sure changes are incorporated in the new ebuild
(such as added documentation.) If there are no required changes to the ebuild
from the previous version, then don't attach the ebuild. Just say so in the bug
report that you copied the ebuild over and verified that the package works and
installs properly.
