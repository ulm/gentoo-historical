		The Gentoo ombudsman mediates disputes between Gentoo Linux Developers.

		<p>
			Given the impressive number of Gentoo developers, it is inevitable
			that occasional clashes will occur between developers and managers
			and between developers and developers.  Establishment of an official
			ombudsman--one who has been assigned to <e>impartially</e> 
			investigate complaints and settle disputes--is one mechanism to
			prevent such disputes from escalating out of control.  Developers
			who need to voice a concern (anything from technical disagreements
			to worries about developer burn-out) are welcome and encouraged to
			do so by sending an e-mail to 
			<mail link="ombudsman@gentoo.org">ombudsman@gentoo.org</mail>.
		</p>
		<p>
			An additional, and perhaps even more important, job of the ombudsman
			is to look for sources of interpersonal friction, and then to 
			attempt to ameliorate matters well before tempers begin to flare.

			Establishment of a Gentoo Ombudsman was first proposed in
