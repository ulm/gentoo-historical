This guide documents the GWN release process, from authoring individual
articles to posting the finished product on the website. The guide's primary 
purpose is to ensure continuous GWN releases independent of possible fall-offs 
and hiatuses.

<section>
<title>The GWN manifesto</title>
<body>
<p>
The <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/gwn.xml">Gentoo Weekly Newsletter 
(GWN)</uri> was founded in December 2002 with the purpose of reporting news from the 
Gentoo project, and to provide a two-way communication conduit between the developers 
and the Gentoo community.
</p>
<p>
As an official PR subproject, the GWN has two main roles to fulfill. It's a 
propaganda instrument with the aim of promoting Gentoo as a whole, by forming a 
public image of a highly dynamic, technologically advanced, ambitious project. The
second role, equally important, is its community-building aspect, by making Gentoo 
accessible to users, transparent in its movements, and eventually attractive enough 
to facilitate the recruiting of new developers.
</p>
<p>
While being an official publication, the GWN doesn't necessarily reflect opinions
of the Gentoo Foundation trustees, or the Gentoo Council, or a majority of developers, 
or any other steering committee. It's an independent voice within the boundary of its 
voluntary adherence to the Gentoo Social Contract and the ethics of journalism.
</p>
<p>
The GWN is written by Gentoo developers, users, amateurs or sometimes even external
authors not affiliated with Gentoo in any way other than by submitting an article
to the GWN. The editor is responsible for keeping contributions within the guidelines,
and looks after ethical and/or legal implications. The newsletter is published under the 
same Creative Commons license as the documentation on the website.

<section>
<title>Best practices</title>
<body>
<p>
There never was much in terms of rules set forth by the editors of the GWN. The GWN 
authors have always based their contributions on implicit understanding rather than 
explicit editorial guidelines. However, some of the best practices that have proven their 
usefulness can be summarized in a few bullet points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The GWN has been published in American English since its first issue. Purely 
for consistency reasons, we continue to write "favorite" rather than "favourite", 
prefer to "organize" and not "organise" things, and would probably call a "jumper"
a "sweater."
</li>
<li>Punctuation also follows American typography rules. Readers 
outside the US may not feel entirely comfortable with a period to the <e>left</e>
of an end-of-quotation mark, but that's how it's done in American English, even when 
it's only a single word that's being quoted.
</li>
<li>
"Gentoo" is a generic term to be used in a number of combinations. As of 
itself, it's encompassing everything that's being done in and around the project, 
and can be used to refer to the "Gentoo community," the "Gentoo subprojects," the "Gentoo 
fan clubs," the "Gentoo metadistribution," the "Gentoo way of life." Then we have 
distinct projects that take a name of their own, like the legal bodies and a few
tangible or political manifestations, e.g. Gentoo {Linux|*BSD|for Mac
OS X} etc., Gentoo {Foundation|Inc.} or Gentoo {Forums|Council}. Only those 
proper names are capitalized.</li>
<li>
Speaking of which, capitalization inside headlines is generally frowned upon. We Don't Do That.
</li>
<li>
Pictures need to be related to the article they appear inside. Their size is 
limited to 600x450 pixels and a maximum of 100KB. If the copyright of an image
lies not with the Gentoo Foundation, a note naming the photographer or the 
copyright holder is added below.
</li>
<li>
ISO standards are followed wherever we can, including currencies ("USD" rather than
"dollars" or "$", "JPY" not "Yen" and so on), dates are always written in day 
(numerical), month (spelt out), year (numerical) order: "12 November 2005," not 
"11/12/05" or "Nov 12, 2005."
</li>
<li>
Names are always given in first name, last name order. This includes Japanese, Korean or 
Chinese names.
</li>
</ul>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>The GWN sections</title>
<section>
<title>First section: main Gentoo news</title>
<body>

<p>
The top section of each GWN contains news contributions from inside the entire 
Gentoo project. This includes status updates from projects and subprojects, 
release information, important changes to the Portage tree, infrastructure 
heads-ups, Gentoo-related news from sponsors, reports from major public events 
like international trade fairs and developer conferences - in essence a wide 
variety of things of significant importance to readers. 
</p>
<p>
Contributions to this chapter are often sensitive in nature, sufficient time
before publication should be allowed for, in order to cross-check information 
with Gentoo developers directly involved.
</p>
<p>
A special case of main news items are the project updates to be submitted by
the project leads. Sending a weekly reminder to the various project leads 
asking for an update (if available) helps assuring input for this category. 
</p>
<p>
If need be, errata and corrections to items in earlier GWNs are appended to 
the end of the main section, regardless of which chapter they've actually occurred in.
</p>
<p>
Once finalized, all information should be bundled in XML excerpts following the
syntax described in <uri link="#syntax">GWN XML Syntax</uri>.
</p>

<p>
These snippets of XML code should be concatenated and sent to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail> (let us
assume with the name <path>news.xml</path>).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Second section: feature rotation</title>
<body>

<p>
The second section is designed to rotate through different
categories, including: developer portraits (dev of the week), user
stories and interviews (practical application of Gentoo in external
projects, companies etc.), and the "Future zone" that deals with
Gentoo-related development not entirely fit for release yet, but
interesting enough to receive advance coverage:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Future zone</b> - New developments inside existing projects and entirely 
new projects alike can brag about what they're currently doing, and where their 
efforts will eventually lead. The Future zone is not limited to projects
entirely governed by Gentoo developers, we occasionally open this space to 
outside development -- provided it shows sufficient relevance for Gentoo, or 
at least a promise to end up in the Portage tree at some point.
</li>
<li>
<b>Developer of the week</b> - A standardized questionnaire is sent to developers
who agree to be portrayed in this section. The monography is compiled from their
answers and additional information at the discretion of the author. A photo is
added at the top.
</li>
<li>
<b>User stories</b> - Often contributed by people who use Gentoo professionally
in a corporation or campus, this feature finds unusually interesting applications
of Gentoo and exposes them to the public.
</li>
<li>
<b>Interviews</b> - Same as above, except that it's conducted as a written interview.
Answering questions is often easier for a busy CTO than writing a whole article
all by him- or herself. A note at the top explains who is answering, the questions 
are marked by emphasizing them ("<e>Who are you?</e>", see <uri link="#syntax">GWN 
XML Syntax</uri> for details)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of these categories have in common that they go into much detail about a single
topic, either portraying an individual or describing a project or product. They
don't carry an explicit limit to their length, but in general shouldn't exceed a 
third of the entire length of the GWN.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Third section: "Heard in the community"</title>
<body>

<p>
There are various community sources. To distinguish them we use the following
construction:
</p>

<pre caption="Community coverage">
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;title&gt;<i>Community Source</i>&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Title of community information 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
<i>Summary</i>
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;uri link="<i>location of source</i>"&lt;<i>Name/Title of referenced source</i>&lt;/uri&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Title of community information 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
<comment>...</comment>

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This construct should be repeated for every source. Possible sources are (just
to name a few - more are always better):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web Forums - <uri>http://forums.gentoo.org</uri></li>
  <li>gentoo-devel - <uri link="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel">archive</uri></li>
  <li>gentoo-user - <uri link="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.user">archive</uri></li>
  <li>gentoo-server - <uri link="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.server">archive</uri></li>
  <li>alt.os.linux.gentoo - <uri link="http://http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.gentoo">archive</uri></li>
  <li>Planet Gentoo - <uri link="http://planet.gentoo.org">Planet</uri></li>
</ul>

<p>
For each of those sources, no more than three items per week should get 
coverage in this section. The main purpose of this section is to point readers
to possible sources of community information, not duplication of content. If
several threads are dealing with the same topic, they can be appended to a 
common abstract, with links to Howtos or additional information from 
different sources if appropriate. Coverage per item should fit in a few lines 
and link to either a Forum or mailing list thread, the newsgroup via Google 
groups, or archived blog entries (permanent links only, please).
</p>
<p>
The combined information (for instance <path>community.xml</path>) should be
sent to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail>).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Fourth section: Gentoo international</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo international gets news from around the globe, mostly regional activities 
of Gentoo user groups, but also limited releases of Gentoo-related products, for 
example, like a South-African web hoster switching to Gentoo on their server farm 
etc. To prevent any misunderstanding: US activities belong here, too. International 
news should be written as if it was generic news, it only needs to be bundled in a 
different file (for instance <path>international.xml</path>).
</p>

<p>
Titles are standardized to the extent that they start with the name of the country 
and a colon, e.g. "Canada: " followed by the actual headline: 
</p>

<pre caption="Possible title for an Italian event">
&lt;title&gt;<i>Italy:</i> Catalyst conference in Milano&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Again, <path>international.xml</path> should be sent to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Fifth section: Gentoo in the press</title>
<body>
<p>
The press clippings section gathers references to Gentoo being mentioned in 
other media. This includes newspapers and magazines, but also books, radio and
TV coverage, PR websites that carry Gentoo-related press releases. Some sites
are deliberately avoided, like Slashdot threads that only get coverage here when 
there's an original debate about Gentoo, not just Gentoo mentioned five times in
comments on some thread. Others are treated with a certain predilection, like 
Distrowatch articles about Gentoo and its spin-offs, for example.
</p>
<p>
Titles have the name of the media followed by the published date in brackets. 
For every non-English publication (there's no limit to languages used in the
press clippings) the language is added in the title, right after the publication
date. 
</p>
<pre caption="Title for press clipping">
&lt;title&gt;<i>Diario del Gentooista</i> (12 November 2005, in Spanish)&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The abstract always quotes a couple of ideas from the article, but it's 
also supposed to put things into perspective for readers with a stronger Gentoo 
affiliation than the average public. If an article (or video or any other trace)
is available on the Internet, a link should be included in the abstract, not in 
the title. Sites that require registration before allowing access to the content
that's referenced here should best be avoided altogether, or, if that's impossible, 
clearly marked as such.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Tips and Tricks</title>
<body>

<p>
Tips and tricks can be constructed using regular sections (see <uri
link="#syntax">GWN XML Syntax</uri>). Send the tips to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail> in a
single file (<path>tips.xml</path>).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Moves, Adds, and Changes</title>
<body>

<p>
The following XML construction should be used:
</p>

<pre caption="Moves construction">
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Moves&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The following developers recently left the Gentoo team:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;<i>Some developer, or &lt;e&gt;None this week&lt;/e&gt;</i>&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Repeat for <c>Adds</c> and <c>Changes</c> and change accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The result should be combined and sent to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail>
(<path>teamchanges.xml</path>).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Gentoo security</title>
<body>

<p>
The <uri link="glsa2gwn.py">glsa2gwn.py</uri> script should be used to create
the necessary sections for the GLSAs. Just run the following command for each
GLSA issued in the last week:
</p>

<pre caption="Running glsa2gwn.py">
$ <i>glsa2gwn.py /path/to/some/glsa.xml &gt;&gt; security.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
Then send <path>security.xml</path> to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail>.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Bugzilla</title>
<body>

<p>
The bug statistics section of the GWN is entirely driven by a script called 
<uri link="bugs2gwn.py">bugs2gwn.py</uri>. Written by AJ Armstrong and modified only slightly 
since its initial version, it dumps various information directly from <uri 
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, performs calculations over a seven day
period and concatenates the output for use in the GWN. Run the script:
</p>
<pre caption="Bugzilla section script">
# <i>bugs2gwn.py &gt; bugsYYYYMMDD.xml</i>
</pre>
<p>
and send the resulting file to <mail
link="gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org</mail>.

</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Creating the GWN</title>
<section>
<title>Combining all chapters</title>
<body>

<p>
This is the job of the <e>editor</e>. Make sure you have all the appropriate files 
that were sent to gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org in your vicinity -- you'll need them.
</p>

<p>
We start off with a <uri link="template.txt">template</uri> for the GWN. Copy it
to <path>YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml</path> with of course YYYYMMDD the release date
of the GWN. The file is commented heavily, but I'll give an overview for 
completeness sake:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fill in the release date under <c>subtitle</c></li>
  <li>
    Fill in the appropriate authors for this week's GWN. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the <c>abstract</c> of the GWN. If you need an example, check the 
    news items on Gentoo's main page
  </li>
  <li>
    Increase the volume/issue inside <c>version</c>
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the release date in <c>date</c>, the correct format is yyyy-mm-dd.
  </li>
  <li>
    Include the various files sent to gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org
  </li>
  <li>
    Double-check the list of available translations
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Verifying the GWN</title>
<body>

<p>
Store the file inside your <uri link="#testing">testing ground</uri>. At the
same time, store the image of the developer (of the "Featured Developer of the
Week") inside <path>gwn/images/gwn</path>.
</p>

<p>
Now verify and test your GWN edition.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Proofreading the GWN</title>
<body>
<p>
Time permitting, you should always send a draft of the upcoming issue to two mailing
lists, gentoo-gwn-admin@gentoo.org and gentoo-core@gentoo.org. Try to aim for a time
of day when sufficient numbers of native English speakers are available, six to 
eight hours ahead of publication are good practice, albeit seldom practical. Proofreaders
aren't bound to any particular format, they can send fully-fledged patches, <c>sed</c> style
"<path>s/foo/bar</path>" sniplets or other corrections to the text.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Publishing the GWN</title>
<body>

<p>
The publication date of the GWN is set to 0:00 UTC on Monday of each week. Try to conform
to this as much as possible, there are automatic scripts in the wild that trigger on the 
GWN's publication, for example to reference the new issue in other media. If the deadline
is missed by too much of a delay, we risk dropping out of those backtracks.
</p>
<p>
Publishing the GWN is done in steps. First, create the text version of the GWN.
A script called gwnproc.py is used for this, with a separate xsl file that
provides the formatting for plain text output.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the text version of the GWN">
$ <i>gwnproc.py YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml &gt; YYYYMMDD-newsletter.txt</i>
</pre>

<p>
Edit the resulting <path>YYYYMMDD-newsletter.txt</path> file so that it reads
fluently. Pay attention to the links in the Bugzilla statistics section, the 
script folds lines after 75 characters, which is a nuisance to mail clients
if you don't put those links back on a single line.
</p>

<p>
Next, commit the image(s) and the GWN files to CVS:
</p>

<pre caption="Committing to CVS, part I">
<comment>(The image(s))</comment>
$ <i>cp gwn/images/gwn/YYYYMMDD-nickname.jpg cvs/gentoo/xml/images/gwn</i>
$ <i>cd cvs/gentoo/xml/images/gwn</i>
$ <i>cvs -ko add YYYYMMDD-nickname.jpg</i>
$ <i>cvs commit -m 'Image of nickname' YYYYMMDD-nickname.jpg</i>
$ <i>cd</i>
</pre>

<p>
The GWN overview page references the current issue of the GWN separately. You
need to duplicate the <path>YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml</path> file as 
<path>current.xml</path> and submit both to CVS.
</p>
<pre caption="Committing to CVS, part II">
$ <i>cp gwn/YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/news/en/gwn</i>
$ <i>cd cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/news/en/gwn</i>
$ <i>cvs add YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml</i>
$ <i>cp YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml current.xml</i>
$ <i>cvs commit -m 'GWN release for YYYYMMDD' YYYYMMDD-newsletter.*</i>
</pre>

<p>
Add an entry for the current issue to the GWN overview file, <path>gwn.xml</path>
in the same directory. This is a list of the main news items inside the newsletter
conforming to the format found in the table, and very important because the RSS
feed uses this entry as its title.
</p>
<pre caption="Committing to CVS, part III">
$ <i>vi cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/news/en/gwn</i>
<comment>Edit the table and add an entry for the current issue</comment>
$ <i>cd cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/news/en/gwn</i>
$ <i>cvs commit -m 'GWN overview updated' gwn.xml</i>
</pre>
<p>
Write a news item for this week's GWN. You can use this <uri
link="template-news.txt">template</uri>. Rename to
<path>YYYYMMDD-gwn.xml</path>, edit and then commit it to CVS to publish it
online:
</p>

<pre caption="Committing the news item">
$ <i>cp gwn/template-news.txt cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/news/YYYYMMDD-gwn.xml</i>
$ <i>cd cvs/gentoo/xml/htdocs/news</i>
$ <i>cvs add YYYYMMDD-gwn.xml</i>
$ <i>cvs commit -m 'GWN YYYYMMDD is available' YYYYMMDD-news.xml</i>
$ <i>cd</i>
</pre>

<p>
After committing all xml files and images to CVS, the synchronization to the 
web mirrors takes up to one hour. You should wait for this to happen before
sending out the plain text version of the current GWN through the 
<path>gentoo-gwn@gentoo.org</path> mailing list. Open your
favorite mail client and put the text <e>inside</e> the body of your e-mail.
Subject it with the appropriate date (modeled after this: "Gentoo Weekly 
Newsletter 12 November 2005") and send it out. The mailing list is moderated, so 
you need to reply to the moderation request it sends to you before the GWN is 
finally dispatched to the list's subscribers.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations; you have now successfully released a GWN :)
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter id="syntax">
<title>GWN XML Syntax</title>
<section>
<title>Single sections</title>
<body>

<p>
Single sections, such as used by news items, should be constructed like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Syntax for news items">
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;title&gt;<i>Title of the News Item</i>&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
<i>One paragraph.</i>
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
<i>Multiple paragraphs are of course encouraged :)</i>
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Inside &lt;p&gt; constructs one can use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;e&gt;...&lt;/e&gt; for <e>emphasised text</e></li>
  <li>&lt;c&gt;...&lt;/c&gt; for <c>commands</c> users can type</li>
  <li>&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; for <b>bold text</b></li>
  <li>
    &lt;uri link="http://www.gentoo.org"&gt;some link&lt;/uri&gt; for 
    <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org">some link</uri>
  </li>
  <li>
    &lt;mail link="some@address.com"&gt;name of person&lt;/mail&gt; is used for
    e-mail addresses
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Apart from &lt;p&gt; one can also use lists like the above. This is accomplished
through &lt;ul&gt; (unnumbered) or &lt;ol&gt; (numbered) constructs:
</p>

<pre caption="Using a list construct">
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    <i>Inline text like with &lt;p&gt; constructs</i>
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    <i>Another bullet</i>
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Using code listings</title>
<body>

<p>
A code listing can be put wherever one would be able to place &lt;p&gt;
constructions - <e>not inside them!</e>. Code listings provide <e>no</e> word
wrapping - if you place everything on a single line the result will be a
document that forces the user to scroll horizontally!
</p>

<p>
Inside a code listing, the following XML constructs are allowed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;comment&gt;...&lt;/comment&gt; color the text in red</li>
  <li>&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt; color the text in blue (used for commands)</li>
</ul>

<p>
A code listing is created with the &lt;pre&gt; tag:
</p>

<pre caption="Example pre">
&lt;pre caption="Example pre"&gt;
# &lt;i&gt;some command&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Adding illustrations to articles</title>
<body>
<p>
Pictures (only .jpg or .png, please) accompany articles or interview according 
to the following syntax. Again, &lt;figure&gt; constructs can be put wherever 
one would be able to place &lt;p&gt; constructions.
</p>
<pre caption="XML Syntax for adding a picture">
&lt;figure link="<i>/images/gwn/YYYYMMDD_nickname.jpg</i>"
        short="<i>Full Name</i>"
	caption="<i>Full Name</i>" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The naming convention for images in the GWN is <path>YYYYMMDD_name.jpg</path> (or .png) with
<path>YYYYMMDD</path> the year-month-day of the GWN release and
<path>name</path> a single word best describing the picture, i.e. the nickname of a developer,
a trade fair acronym etc.

<p>
Create a directory <path>~/gwn</path>. Inside that directory, create the
<path>dtd/</path>, <path>css/</path>, <path>xsl/</path> and 
<path>/images</path> directories.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the directories">
$ <i>mkdir -p gwn/css gwn/dtd gwn/xsl gwn/images/gwn</i>
</pre>

<p>
Execute the following downloading instructions to download the specific XSL
file, DTD, CSS and images:
</p>

<pre caption="Storing the required files">
$ <i>wget -P gwn/dtd/ http://www.gentoo.org/dtd/guide.dtd</i>
$ <i>wget -P gwn/css/ http://www.gentoo.org/css/main.css</i>
$ <i>wget -P gwn/images/  http://www.gentoo.org/images/gbot-s.gif \
  http://www.gentoo.org/images/gridtest.gif \
  http://www.gentoo.org/images/gtop-s.jpg \
  http://www.gentoo.org/images/line.gif \
  http://www.gentoo.org/images/netraverse-gentoo.gif</i>
$ <i>wget -P gwn/xsl/ http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/local/guide.xsl</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now edit <path>/etc/xml/catalog</path> on your system and add the following
line:
</p>

<pre caption="Addendum to catalog file">
&lt;rewriteURI uriStartString="/dtd" rewritePrefix="<i>/home/you/gwn/dtd</i>"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Of course make sure that the <c>rewritePrefix</c> points to your created
<path>gwn/dtd</path> directory.

<title>Testing a GWN</title>
<body>

<p>
To test a GWN, we first verify it's XML accuracy. Go to the <path>gwn/</path>
directory and run:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the XML accuracy">
$ <i>xmllint --valid --noout YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
If the <c>xmllint</c> application gives no output, your GWN is fine. To view
the result of the XML, run <c>xsltproc</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Running xsltproc">
$ <i>xsltproc xsl/guide.xsl YYYYMMDD-newsletter.xml &gt; test.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
Point your browser to the <path>gwn/test.html</path> file on your disk - it
should render the GWN correctly.
