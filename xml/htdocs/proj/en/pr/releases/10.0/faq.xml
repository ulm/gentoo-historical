The 10th anniversary Gentoo hybrid media is made by the community for the
community. It was created with the help of gentoo developers from  around the
world and users alike. Thank you all for your contributions and suggestions!

<chapter>
<title>Getting Started</title>

<section id="arch">
<title>Download the correct iso for your hardware</title>
<body>

<p>
The livedvd-x86-x86_64 will work on x86 or x86_64. If your arch is x86 boot with
the default. If your arch is amd64 boot with gentoo64. 
</p>

<p>
The livedvd-amd64 is for x86-64 specification. Boot with the default. 
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="options">
<title>Boot options for the LiveDVD</title>
<body>

<p>
This <uri
	link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~dabbott/pr/livedvd-readme.txt">README</uri> lists
the possible command line options that can be used to tweak the boot process of
this DVD.  This lists the Gentoo-specific options, along with a few options that
are built-in to the kernel, but that have been proven very useful to our users.
Also, all options that start with "do" have a "no" inverse, that does the
opposite.  For example, "doscsi" enables SCSI support in the initial ramdisk
boot, while "noscsi" disables it.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="default">
<title>Default root and user password</title>

<body>

<p>
The default user is gentoo and the password is the same.
</p>

<pre caption="How do I become root?">
$ <i>sudo su -</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can use <c>passwd</c> to change the password for the user you are logged 
into. As root, you can change any user password by issuing the command
<c>passwd username</c> For extra options and setting, please <c>man passwd</c>.
</p>

<section id="usb">
<title>Can I copy the image to a usb stick?</title>

<body>

<p>
Yes, to determine your device before you plug it in open a terminal and tail
/var/log/messages.
</p>
<pre caption="Determine Device">
# <i>tail -f /var/log/messages</i>
</pre>
<note>
You will need at least a 4GB device!
</note>
<pre caption="Copy the image">
# <i>dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdb</i>
</pre>
<impo>
Do not point to a partition number!
</impo>

</body>
</section>

<section id="autologin">
<title>Can I resume the autologin?</title>
<body>

<p>
To resume the KDM autologin, you need to press the ESC key and wait for the
timeout to pass or just hit the enter key to login.  
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section id="wireless">
<title>Can I install firmware for my wireless card?</title>
<body>

<p>
Sure, you just need to copy the firmware to /lib/firmware and reload your
wireless cards modules. In the example below I install the firmware for a Ralink
RT2501USB wireless LAN chipset, that requires non-free firmware for their
operation, which can not be included on the Live DVD because of license issues.
I copy the firmware from a 2GB usb stick.
</p>

<pre caption="Install the firmware">
<comment>First lets mount the usb stick</comment>
# <i>mkdir /mnt/pin</i>
# <i>mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/pin</i>
# <i>cp /mnt/pin/firmware/rt73.bin /lib/firmware</i>
<comment>Reload modules so the firmware is included.</comment>
# <i>modprobe -r rt73usb  rt2x00usb  rt2x00lib</i>
<comment>Time to insert modules amd load firmware.</comment>
# <i>modprobe rt73usb</i>
<comment>Lets restart wicd to pickup wlan0</comment>
# <i>/etc/init.d/wicd restart</i>

<title>Trouble Shooting</title>

<section id="xorg-server">
<title>Xorg</title>
<body>

<p>
The LiveDVD uses xorg-server-1.6.3 and hal-0.5.13. X.Org is well on its way to
getting rid of lots of xorg.conf magic and moving it into obscure elements of
HAL. We currently use a blank /etc/X11/xorg.conf and let the magic of hal do its
thing. Most hardware is supported but not all.  
</p>
 
<p>
If you can not start X then it is useful to paste /var/log/Xorg.0.log so others
can view it for trouble shooting.  
</p>

<p>
You can paste the log like this from the command line.
</p>

<pre caption="Paste log from command line">
# <i>curl -F file=@/var/log/Xorg.0.log  nopaste.com/a</i>
</pre>

<p>
Some people have reported success by creating an xorg.conf file generated from X
-configure and renaming from xorg.conf.new and copy to /etc/X11 and hand
editing. I would suggest removing all keyboard and mouse sections plus removing
the references to modules as this is handled by xorg and hal automatically.
Below is an edited xorg.conf with the driver changed to "vesa" which should work
for most.  </p>

<pre caption="Create /etc/X11/xorg.conf">
$ <i>sudo su -</i>
# <i>X -configure</i>
# <i>cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/</i>
# <i>cd /etc/X11/</i>
# <i>cp xorg.conf.new xorg.conf</i>
# <i>nano -w xorg.conf</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/xdm restart</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once edited it should be similar to the one I created below.
</p>

<section id="xdm">
<title>Restart kdm</title>
<body>
<p>
On some graphic chipsets it may become necessary to restart kdm if you
experience a blinking cursor in the top left of the screen or xorg-server
appears to have frozen.
</p>

<pre caption="Restart kdm">
<comment>First lets return to the command line.</comment>
# <i>Ctrl+Alt+F1</i>
<comment>Now we can restart kdm.</comment>
# <i>/etc/init.d/xdm restart</i>
</pre>

<section id="sound">
<title>Raise PCM volume</title>
<body>
<p>
On some chipsets (snd-hda-intel) it may be necessary to raise the PCM volume.

First lets check current values.
