<title>Interview with David Gallo and Cassius Adams from SevenL Networks, a
	sponsor of Gentoo for 6 years running.</title>

<body>

<p>
<b>1. Introduction: Who you are, and what is your role at SevenL Networks
	Inc.?</b>
</p>

<p>
I will start off by introducing myself. My name is David Gallo (<uri
	link="http://twitter.com/davidgallo">@DavidGallo</uri>), and I was born and
raised in Toronto, Canada. I have an athletic and musical background, ranging
from golfing to violin playing. My passion for technology has resided in me for
as long as I can remember. I have always been intrigued with the idea of using
technology to optimize the lives of people and organizations. I hold a strong
belief in customer service and personal relationships. At SevenL, we have very
little bureaucracy and we are not people of flash or title. At the company, I
"technically" hold a position as Managing Partner, but am currently practicing a
role in Business Development. In this position, I am in charge of the business
side of things, as well as providing the overall vision for the organization…
with the help of our team of course! =) 
</p>

<p>
And I'm Cassius Adams, also born and raised in Toronto. I hold the positions of
Co-Founder &amp; Senior Account Exec at SevenL. Like David, I strongly believe
in providing good customer service. I have always found that it helps me to
understand customers’ needs better, build better relationships with them,
negotiate win-win scenarios, and keep them happy as a customer overall. Ever
since my TRS-80, computers and technology have always been a major part of my
life, both for the purposes of work and play.

<b>2.What is 7L (including founding, scale of operations, etc.)</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>David:</b> SevenL was originally established as LabattRacks.Net Managing
Services Inc. in 1999. The company owned the Data Center which is located at the
east side of Toronto, surrounded by 100 000 sqft. of industrial/commercial
office space. Daniel Gallo, the founding director, has an extensive background
in the Real Estate industry and has been a tremendous help and mentor over the
years. LabattRacks.Net leased the full data center floor to an ISP that was
eventually bought out. In the spring of 2003, the DC floor became vacant, and
SevenL was born with the help of Cassius Adams, Carey McLelland and Todd Berman.
Within a few months of inception, SevenL began donating dedicated servers to
Gentoo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cassius:</b> SevenL provides <uri
	link="https://www.sevenl.net/vps-hosting">VPS Hosting</uri>, <uri
	link="https://www.sevenl.net/dedicated-server">Dedicated Servers</uri>, <uri
	link="https://www.sevenl.net/managed-hosting">Managed Hosting</uri> solutions,
and <uri link="https://www.sevenl.net/colocation">Server Colocation</uri> space
to businesses and professionals. At the risk of sounding like a sales guy, our
affordable prices, network quality, and customer support, or "Relentless Support
&trade;", are the largest factors contributing to our continually growing
worldwide customer base. 
</p>

<p>
<b>3. What services do you provide for Gentoo?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>David:</b> Currently we host condor.gentoo.org, corvid.gentoo.org, and
pigeon.gentoo.org. Gentoo is widely used on our network between internal servers
and client servers! Match made in heaven =)
</p>

<p>
<b>4. How do you use Gentoo in your environment?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>David:</b> Gentoo is primarily used in a Server environment. The servers are
configured as Web/mail or as EDGE routers on test networks. Maintaining our
systems is primarily done by using Portage. Gentoo has been used on various
machines for many purposes within our organization. It has enabled us to test
several different branches of software, as well as mix software branches for
development and experimentation. Gentoo servers are pretty easy to maintain.
Once they are up and configured, emerge and portage can take care of a variety
of issues when and if they arise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>5. Why choose Gentoo?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cassius:</b> Actually, the choice of using Gentoo for our production servers
was initially by association. When SevenL first began we had a developer on
staff that contributed significant code to Gentoo Linux. It was his relationship
with the OS and the Gentoo Organization that lead us to use it internally and we
haven't looked back since! 
</p>

<p>
Gentoo was chosen as an alternative to Slackware Linux. We liked the fact that
Gentoo had a package management system which allowed the user to update a series
of system/user packages in an automated fashion which even included compiling
missing dependencies. The advantage of using Gentoo over other flavors of Linux
is that it allows the user to only install/compile specific packages and
features specially configured for their architecture. Any issues encountered
were either solved by the experience of our team or by using the various Gentoo
forums and wiki’s. We find the support programs and irc channels very helpful.
</p>

<p>
<b>6. Any concluding remarks?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>David:</b> Working with the Gentoo community has been such a positive
experience for SevenL. You guys know what the heck you’re doing (clearly), and
because of your allowance of our donations over the years, we have built up a
strong brand recognition being a Gentoo supporter and Gentoo dedicated hosting
company. We look forward to the ongoing relationship with Gentoo, and are
excited for the future.
</p>

<p>
On behalf of the Gentoo Project and Foundation, we extend a <b>huge thanks</b>
to David and Cassius for taking the time to talk with us, and for the excellent
infrastructure support SevenL has provided Gentoo over the past several years.
