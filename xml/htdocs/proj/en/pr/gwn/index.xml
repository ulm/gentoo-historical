<longname>Gentoo Weekly Newsletter</longname>
<date>2007-03-05</date>

<description>
The Gentoo Weekly Newsletter informs the Gentoo userbase (and other interested
parties) about the latest evolvements in Gentoo with a weekly publication.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
The Gentoo Weekly Newsletter is intended to give users of Gentoo one source of
information about Gentoo. The GWN summarizes the key events in the Gentoo Linux
project each week and presents them in a clear, concise format. With sections
covering general news, security, bugs, portage and other topics, the GWN should
offer something for everyone. The current version of the GWN can always be found
<uri link="/news/en/gwn/current.xml">here</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the GWN is distributed via web and mailing list formats, with
additional formats being considered based on your feedback. To subscribe to the
GWN mailing list, send a blank email to <mail 
link="gentoo-gwn-subscribe@gentoo.org">gentoo-gwn-subscribe@gentoo.org</mail>. 
The GWN will also be available in other languages, as volunteers step forth to
translate.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we'd like to thank the many volunteers who make the GWN possible on a
weekly basis. From the contributors to the translators to the people behind the
scenes, all these people help bring you the GWN. If you're interested in joining
the GWN team, please send an email to <mail
link="gwn-feedback@gentoo.org">gwn-feedback@gentoo.org</mail>.
