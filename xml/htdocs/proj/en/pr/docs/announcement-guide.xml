    <title>Creating announcements</title>
    <section>
      <title>Initial setup</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          To start, you'll need to go through all the setup you would need to do other documentation. This is already well documented <uri link="/proj/en/gdp/doc/doc-tipsntricks.xml">here</uri>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Announcements live in <path>xml/htdocs/news/</path>, relative to the root of the 'gentoo' CVS module. To create a new announcement, just create a new XML file in this directory. Typically, this is of the form <path>YYYYmmdd-some-title-here.xml</path>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The order of announcements is determined by the contents of <path>/dyn/news-index.xml</path>. This file gets generated by a cron job, which does something like <c>ls -r</c>. This means that something like ZZ.xml would always show up first.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to publish <b>several items on the same day</b> with a specific order, <b>add an extra letter</b> to the data, like <path>20080211a-foo.xml</path> and <path>20080211b-bar.xml</path> (the latter will appear above the former).
        </p>
      </body>

      <title>File format</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Announcements are of a variation of your typical <uri link="/doc/en/xml-guide.xml">GuideXML</uri>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best to teach by example, so here's a basic one:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Announcement example"><![CDATA[<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE news SYSTEM "/dtd/guide.dtd">
<news gentoo="yes" category="linux">
  <poster>your_nick_here</poster>
  <date>YYYY-mm-dd</date>
  <title>First post!</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Here there be content!
    </p>
  </body>
</news>
]]></pre>
        <p>Here's what's really important:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gentoo equals very yes</li>
          <li>
            Category should be specified. Eventually XSL uses this to generate an image tag for the announcement. Some valid categories include:
            <ul>
              <li>gentoo</li>
              <li>kde</li>
              <li>main</li>
              <li>linux</li>
              <li>moo</li>
              <li>plans</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Poster... that's you, the one writing the announcement</li>
          <li>Date of the announcement</li>
          <li>Full title of the announcement</li>
          <li>Body of the announcement. You can use the same XML you would be able to in an body tag for GuideXML</li>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Discussion link</title>
      <body>
        <p>The announcement should contain a link to <b>discuss it on the forums</b>. Regretfully, this <b>not automated</b> so you will need to create a thread before posting the announcement.</p>
        <p>You'd add a snippet like so:</p>
        <pre caption="Discussion link"><![CDATA[<p>
  <uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-657125.html">Discuss this!</uri>

    <title>Writing effective announcements</title>
    <section>
      <body>
        <p>
          Now that you have the basics of creating an announcement, we can focus on <b>writing effective announcements</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, at the most basic level we want to <b>inform our audience of something</b>. We also want to make it <b>easy to understand</b> what we're trying to say. We want to explain things in a way that they see <b>why they should care</b> about the announcement. And lastly, we want to <b>engage the audience</b>. Community has always been an important part of Gentoo, and we hope that well-written, timely announcements can help maintain and improve our sense of community.
        </p>

      <title>Tips</title>
      <body>
        <ul>
          <li>Bold key words and phrases.</li>
          <li>
            Avoid over-emphasizing unimportant thing. Doing so takes away from things that are important.
            <ul>
              <li>Example: including specific dates. For things in the recent past, does it matter which day it specifically happened?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be specific about what you are talking about, and avoid ambiguity
            <ul>
              <li>Before: "Here are some stats before and after removing the digest files"</li>
              <li>After: "Here are some stats showing the size of the tree before and after removing the digest files"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid overly long paragraphs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use bullet points and tables when appropriate. It is a lot easier to read a list of bullet point list, than an equivalent sentence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speak directly to the user.
            <ul>
              <li>Use "You" instead of "a user"</li>
              <li>Trying to have a conversation with the audience</li>
              <li>This is supported by having a forum thread go along with an announcement</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Include relevant links whenever possible. Try to integrate them into the text, and avoid having 'here' links.
          </li>
          <li>
            If that's not possible, list references at the end.
            <ul>
              <li>List items most relevant to the user first</li>
              <li>
                Use appropriate text to encourage the user to want to read the reference
                <ul>
                  <li>Explain why the user should care</li>
                  <li>Before: "DevManual entry on Digest and Manifest"</li>
                  <li>After: "Understanding digest and manifest files"</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Explanations are key.
            <ul>
              <li>Think about every word or concept you use. Try to anticipate what the audience might not be familar with.</li>
              <li>This is crucial if you want your announcements to be valuable to the audience.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
