As with any project, the PR project uses a clearly defined roadmap to guide its
decisions.

<title>What is this roadmap for?</title>
<body>

<p>
A roadmap provides people (both members and interested parties) with a
description to where a project is heading. Such a roadmap should be seen as the
official "Where are we going tomorrow?" answer that some people might ask.
</p>

<section>
<title>Why are there 4 roadmaps?</title>
<body>

<p>
The PR project has four subprojects witch each its own roadmap declaration.

<title>Create an Official Presentation Style</title>
<body>

    A couple of styles have been finished and are waiting to be uploaded to an

<p>
Simon P. Hough has been very active lately in the development of a graphical
style that can be used for Gentoo presentation templates. The main efforts that
need to go in this direction is to improve those styles so they all match and
can be used with any possible Gentoo presentation.
</p>

<p>
This means that the styles must be broad enough so that they can be used with
any subject (for instance history, development, documentation, future, ...).
</p>

<title>Create a Presentation-HOWTO</title>

<p>
As Gentoo becomes more mature every day, it is vital that the presentations we
give about Gentoo use a consistent layout and are professional-looking. Although
we don't want to force developers into using our presentation styles (and
possibly content) they are advised to read up on a guide that explains them how
professional presentations are made.
</p>

<p>
This guide should not only contain pointers to succesful presentation tips, but
also provide a technical rundown on the requirements we give in order to accept
a presentation as "Gentoo official". This means that the used fonts, styles,
content separation, structure, ... should be all well-defined.
</p>

<title>Maintain a Presentation Repository</title>

  <th>Contributors</th>
  <ti></ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In many cases developers are interested in giving presentations but don't find
the necessary resources to create a presentation themselves. We should be able
to provide "off the shelf" presentations with <e>correct</e> and <e>up to
date</e> information about Gentoo or a specific Gentoo subject that developers
(or interested people) can use.

<title>Project Mission Statements and Development</title>

  <ti></ti>

</table>

<p>
Every Gentoo project is required to have a well-written Mission Statement and
sort-of roadmap. This information can be used to create presentations on each of
the available projects. As Gentoo is a volunteer-driven project it is
important that the community knows what projects are alive, what their mission
statement is, what they have achieved already and where they are heading to.
</p>

<p>
By providing presentations on each of the projects users should be able to
quickly grasp the essence of the projects. These presentations can also be used
on the various community happenings to provide Gentoo with more visibility to
the outside world.

<title>Create Hand-Outs and Press Maps</title>

</table>

<p>
For Gentoo to become (and stay) a top-level distribution we must not focus only
to the Linux community, but also to more professional institutes, companies
and other environments.
</p>

<p>
In many cases a decent press-map (which contains information about Gentoo, a
collection of the slides given at the presentation, paper on which people can
make notes, ...) is required before a presentation on Gentoo can be given at
such formal events.

<p>
An official document should be made available that lists all upcoming events
Gentoo will attend. It should also provide an overview on the developers that
will attend the event so people might meet face-to-face.
