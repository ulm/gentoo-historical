<description>
It is vital that Gentoo-presentations and -folders contain correct information
and are updated with the most recent information available. This subproject
writes and maintains presentations, folders and other material that users and
developers can safely use to promote or demonstrate Gentoo.

<longdescription>
<p>
With an escalating number of users and increasingly complex projects with
ever-tighter deadlines, Gentoo is probably one of the most actively developed
distributions available today. Keeping everybody informed about the progress
made is more than ever an interesting challenge. Users and developers should be
able to quickly grasp the essence of the project and where it currently stands.

<goals>
The presentation subproject aims to improve the project visibility by providing
all appropriate information in up-to-date, well-targeted presentations and
hand-outs. These can then be downloaded and used by developers, users and
interested parties, not only to read themselves, but also to share with others
through presentations, demonstrations and direct contact with other people.
