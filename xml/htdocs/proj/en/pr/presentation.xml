<longname>Gentoo Presentations</longname>
<date>November 24, 2003</date>

<description>
It is vital that Gentoo-presentations and -folders contain correct information
and are updated with the most recent information available. This subproject
writes and maintains presentations, folders and other material that users and
developers can safely use to promote or demonstrate Gentoo.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
Several users and developers give presentations about Gentoo, either globally or
on specific parts (such as Portage, Writing Ebuilds, Writing Documentation,
...). It is therefor vital that these presentations contain correct information
and are regularly updated. One of the goals of this subproject is to provide
correct presentations about Gentoo. 
</p>

<p>
However, presentations aren't the sole subject of this project. During events
people might be interesting in propagating Gentoo folders and flyers. These too
should contains correct information and be up to date. We should therefor design
professional-looking folders, flyers and posters and make them downloadable to
interested users.
