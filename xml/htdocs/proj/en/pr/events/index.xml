<longname>Gentoo Events</longname>
<date>21 March 2006</date>

<description>
The Free Software Community is colored with many happenings and events. Very
important on such events is the availability of the major players, including
distributions. This subproject tries to cover all events where Gentoo can
present itself.
</description>

<longdescription>
The Gentoo Events project ("events") is the official Gentoo project for
coordinating Gentoo's presence at various events hosted by the Free Software
Community. This includes trade shows and developer meetings.
</longdescription>

<goals>
The goal of the Gentoo Events project is to coordinate the Gentoo presence at
these events.  This includes things such as procuring hardware, assisting
developers in their travel and accomodations needs, obtaining printed press
materials and release media, obtaining posters and flyers, and generally
helping to ensure that our involvement in the event is a positive one that puts
Gentoo in a good light, as well as making sure we have fun doing it.

			<p>This is just a brain dump for now of the stuff that I have
			received over email regarding upcoming events. It's not going to be
			very pretty. As such, these are in no particular order.</p>
			<p>Also, I have not listed any conferences in which there is not a
			contact available. If you wish to have a conference listed here,
			there must be a contact.</p>
