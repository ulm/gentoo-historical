The Southern California Linux Expo is once again in Los Angeles for SCALE 6x. However, this time around, the expo will offer more booth space and an increased number of tutorial sessions. SCALE features an exhibit floor for vendors and attendees to meet and interact. However, the expo also invites many prominent members of the open source community to speak at the event. All of this helps make the community-run event an excellent place to learn more about open source projects.
