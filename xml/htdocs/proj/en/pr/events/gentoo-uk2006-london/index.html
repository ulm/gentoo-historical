<h1>Announcing Gentoo UK 2006</h1>

<p>
Since 2004, we have been hosting annual Gentoo UK conferences. Following on from the success of the previous two events, we are pleased to announce the Gentoo UK 2006 Conference.
</p>

<p>
This year, the conference will take place on <b>Saturday 8th July 2006</b>, in <b>Central London</b>. The appointed venue is The Resource Centre, situated on Holloway Road. <a href="venue.html">More information about the venue is available</a>.
</p>

<p>
Anyone and everyone interested in Gentoo Linux is welcome to attend. The conference will feature a series of presentations mostly given by Gentoo developers, as well as some general discussion and help sessions, not to forget social events and a chance to get to know users and developers of the distribution.
</p>

<p>
<b>Registration is now open.</b> As our numbers are limited, we require people to register before the event, by simply leaving a name and email address. The registration form can be found <a href="http://reactivated.net/gentoo-uk-2006-register.php">here</a>.
