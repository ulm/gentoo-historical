<h1>Venue</h1>

<p>
<img src="http://www.theresourcecentre.org.uk/images/firstpage_bottom.jpg" align="right" />
<b>The Resource Centre</b> is a purpose-built conference centre, offering 16 rooms for hire to the voluntary sector. The building is owned by the <b>City Parochial Foundation</b>.
</p>

<p>
We have one seminar room available, as well as a data projector and screen. Wireless internet access will be available.
</p>

<p>
The resource centre is situated near a large restaurant/pub, which we will be most likely using for lunch. There is also a small cafeteria in the resource centre.
</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
The resource centre is located in <b>Central London</b>, on Holloway Road.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that you use the London Underground train service. The nearest tube station is <b>Holloway Road</b>, located on the Picadilly line, just 2 stops from Kings Cross. After leaving the station onto the street, cross the road, turn left, and walk up the street for approximately 5 minutes. You will see a pub called <b>THE CORONET</b> with a <em>huge</em> sign. The Resource Centre is just a couple of buildings further on, on the same side of the road. The entrance is quite obvious.
</p>

<p>
The Resource Centre website includes a <a href="http://www.theresourcecentre.org.uk/map_directions.html">short directions page</a> which explains other ways of reaching the venue. You can find a more readable map <a href="map.pdf">here</a> (PDF).
</p>

<p>
James Rowe pointed out that the <a href="http://journeyplanner.tfl.gov.uk/user/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en">TFL Journey Planner</a> is an invaluable resource for planning travel around London. It allows you to plan journeys including travel by train/tube/bus/taxi/foot. Please note that there is more than one Holloway Road in London, so when using this site for travel planning, you should use the postcode of the venue: <b>N7 6PA</b>.
</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>
Some people may wish to stay in London a night or two before/after the event. London hotels are typically very expensive, so you'll want to be looking for a cheap B&amp;B or similar.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/conferences/index.asp?page_id=3">Imperial College Student Accommodation</a> is one promising candidate. The most basic accommodation starts at £42 per night (Pembridge Gardens) and is in a nice central location. 
</p>

<p>
John Mylchreest provided some other hotel details:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Travelodge in Kings Cross is £75 per night, a room normally sleeps 2.</li>
<li>The Athena Hotel charge £58 for a single, £75 for a twin, and £93 for a triple. Internet access is available at £5 per day. They are located at 110-112 Sussex Gardens, Paddington.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.generatorhostels.com/london/">Generator Hostel London</a> is really really cheap, especially if you choose to sleep in a dorm with a few strangers. Private rooms are also available.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If anyone knows of any other reasonably priced (and not too shabby) accommodation which doesn't have any hidden costs, please <a href="mailto:dsd@gentoo.org">let me know</a>.
