Annual Australian conference for Free and Open Source software lovers
</description>

<longdescription><p>
linux.conf.au is coming home for its tenth birthday. It all started in Melbourne back in 1999, with CALU: Conference of Australian Linux Users which was held at Monash University over 3 days in July 1999. Renamed to linux.conf.au in 2001 it has grown to become one of the world's best technical Linux conferences. It continues to be run by community volunteers for the community volunteers that have made Linux and Free and Open Source Software the phenomenon it is today.
