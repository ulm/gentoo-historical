<longname>Gentoo Public Relations Project</longname>

<description>
The Public Relations Team improves Gentoo's visibility towards the rest of the
world.

<!-- What is the PR project -->
<longdescription>
<p>
Extending and improving a distribution such as Gentoo isn't possible without the
involvement of the users. Apart from the bugreporting, enhancement requests,
mailinglist/irc activity and other important aspects, the motivation of the
users is one, perhaps even the most influential facet of distribution activity.
Such motivation can be brought to the users by well-coordinated public relation
efforts.
</p>

<p>
PR goes well beyond just "informing the world". It embraces research, planning,
communication and evaluation manufactured to the organisation's core values. It
does not stop with explaining the virtues of the organisation and the decisions
made, but also extends to uncovering the principles that are used to go where
the organisation wants to go.
