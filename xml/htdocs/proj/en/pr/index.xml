The Public Relations Team improves Gentoo's visibility towards the rest of the
world.

<!-- What is the PR project -->
<longdescription>
<p>
Extending and improving a meta-distribution such as Gentoo isn't possible
without the continued involvement of the users. Apart from the bug reporting,
enhancement requests, mailing list/IRC activity and other important aspects,
the motivation of the users is one of, perhaps even the most, influential facet
of distribution activity. Such motivation can be brought to the users by
well-coordinated public relation efforts.
</p>

<p>
PR goes well beyond just "informing the world". It embraces research, planning,
communication and evaluation manufactured to the organisation's core values. It
does not stop with explaining the virtues of the organisation and the decisions
made, but also extends to uncovering the principles that are used to go where
the organisation wants to go.
