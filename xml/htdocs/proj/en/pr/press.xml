<longname>Gentoo Press Coverage</longname>
<date>November 24, 2003</date>

<description>
Several sites (and other media) exist that occasionally talk about Gentoo using
(submitted or self-written) articles. This subproject maintains a list of all
available Gentoo articles and updates the several press media about Gentoo.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
As Gentoo's popularity increases, more and more sites devote articles to the
Gentoo distribution (and its community). This project aims to list all written
articles so that interested users and developers can easily know where Gentoo
has been referred from.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes (well, frequently :) Gentoo innovates and gives new and unprecedented
features to its users. This news is easily propagated amongst users, but less
frequently to the more broad media. Submitting correct and well-written articles
to well-known media can increase Gentoo's adoptation.
