<longname>Gentoo Press Coverage</longname>
<date>November 24, 2003</date>

<description>
Several sites (and other media) exist that occasionally talk about Gentoo using
(submitted or self-written) articles. This subproject maintains a list of all
available Gentoo articles and updates the several press media about Gentoo.

<p>
Any succesfull project uses its press coverage as an integral part of its
marketing campaign and public relations. Gentoo is not different.
Well-structured press coverage informs people about Gentoo's evolutions and 
keeps issues and/or events before the public eye. Properly distributed press
releases build credibility and expand the Gentoo user base and opportunities.

<goals>
The press coverage project aims to maintain an up-to-date list of all press
coverage of the Gentoo project, and provides well-written information to
third-party press media.
