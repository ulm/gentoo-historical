	<title>Mono FAQ</title>

		<title>Why isn't mono-1.0.x marked stable yet?</title>
		<body>
		<p>
Being a source based distribution, which isn't "officially supported" by mono, we face many challenges getting things truly ready for being "stable".  I'm working ahrd to get the last few bugs filed against mono-1.0.x resolved, so we can finally ahve a stable mono.

		<title>How can I help?</title>
		<body>
		<p>
There are several things you can do to help.  First check out our <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugzilla</uri> and search for all bugs assigned to <mail link="dotnet@gentoo.org">dotnet@gentoo.org</mail>.  Check out some of the bugs and see if you can contribute fixes/ebuilds to the bugs.  Secondly, you can check out my <uri link="howtohelp.xml">How To Help</uri> page, which includes the lastest things I need testing on by other people before I can deem then stable, un-package.mask them, etc.

		<title>I've install mono-1.0.x on my AMD64 box, but I still can't get gtk-sharp to compile. Help!</title>
		<body>
		<p>
Mono did not have JIT support for the AMD64 architecture in the 1.0.x series of mono.  Support was added in the 1.1.x series, so we highly suggest you use that version of mono on any AMD64 machines.  Until mono-1.1.x is added to portage, you can get an overlay tarball of it from Latexer's dev space <uri link="http://dev.gentoo.org/~latexer/">here</uri>

		<title>I've installed gtk-sharp from portage, but when compiling some application, it fails to find gnome-sharp/gtkhtml-sharp/etc. What's wrong?</title>
		<body>
		<p>
Starting with gtk-sharp-1.0.4, the optional components of gtk-sharp have been split into seperate packages.  This is to facilitate having proper dependancies for gtk-sharp consuming applications, while not forcing lots of libs like libgnomedb, etc on people.  You can probably solve your problem by installing the seperate component package that matches the version of gtk-sharp you have installed.

		<title>But .NET stuff is microsoft!  This is linux!</title>
		<body>
		<p>
Yes, that's a fact, but it doesn't mean the technology is 100% horrible.  Further more, any sort of harrasment towards me about it will be ignored.
