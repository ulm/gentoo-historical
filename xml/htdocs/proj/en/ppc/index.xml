     <p>heya, If you're reading this that means you've found the new Gentoo for PowerPC page. The purpose of 
     this page is to provide ppc users with fine grained usefull information about Gentoo/PPC. I could fill 
     an entire newspaper with Gentoo powerpc related news, but I'll try to list the most important current news 
     first. This page will be update on a regular basis. All information regarding gentoo on powerpc or subprojects
     will be availabe from this page or pages linked from this page.</p>

     <p>Gentoo/PPC 1.4 will be released on Linux World Expo. On the expo a 2 disc GRP PPC install disc will be 
     presented to the public. Also a new KDE/GNOME livecd will be available. The kde/gnome livecd presented by
     the ppc team will be a bugfix release compared to the previous livecd released a few weeks ago. We feel 
     that everyone should be able to build his/her own ppc livecds, so we're currently writing documentation for 
     the livecd scripts. These livecds will be sold trough the gentoo store and will spice gentoo/PPC budget which 
     will be managed in a transparant way to the user community.</p>

     <p>Gentoo on the PowerPC G5 *will* be available after the 1.4 release. G5 machines can be delivered to us on the 
     11th of august, but we're lacking funds to buy one. So, if you are able to lend us such a machine or to sponsor us 
     in buying one, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

     <p>A new subproject was announced today, called gentoo-ppc-stable. We're currently setting up mailinglists etc. The 
     purpose of this project is to ensure the ppc stable profile is stable, up to date and well tested. As a lead for this 
     project, blabla aka DarkSpecter presented himself. Ferdinand Klinzer will be helping him out on this. Feel free to join 
     this team to ensure a high quality of all ports marked stable on Gentoo/powerpc.</p>

     <p>As Gentoo moves to a non-profit and well-structured organization, ppc also needs to get organized. We're currently 
     in the process of doing that. Subprojects will be announced on this page, each with their own homepage.</p>

     <p>If you're interested in helping out wrt to ppc, don't hesitate contacting us using ppc@gentoo.org, or any of the 
     ppc mailinglists.</p>
