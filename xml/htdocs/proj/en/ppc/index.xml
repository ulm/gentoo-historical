	<longname>Gentoo Linux PowerPC Development</longname>

	<description>
		The PowerPC Development Project is devoted to keeping
		Gentoo in good shape on the PowerPC architecture.
	</description>

	<longdescription><p>
		The Gentoo/PPC Project works to keep Gentoo the most up to date and fastest
		PowerPC distribution available. We are responsible for the maintainance of
		all powerpc specific meta-data and the testing of all other non powerpc specific 
		meta-data on the PowerPC architecture to ensure portability. Portability implies 
		reuseable meta-data.
		
		Bugs are tracked and resolved from the 
		<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">Gentoo bug tracker</uri> and
		correspondence is maintained on the various PowerPC related mailinglists.
		(gentoo-ppc-user, gentoo-ppc-dev and those belonging to the sub-projects).</p>
	</longdescription>

	<goals>
		<p>
		The goal of the Gentoo PowerPC development project is to guarantee
		that the PowerPC packages build using Gentoo meta-data are up to date.
		By continuously enhancing the meta-data, we provide the PowerPC user with
		the Gentoo community feeling, performance, freedom and up to dateness. 
		The meta-distribution notion allows for a user to to be 
		as bleeding edge as he/she wants:
		</p>
		
		<p>Gentoo is unique because of its interpretation of the Meta-Distribution 
		notion: all architectures share the same 'generic' meta-data (information
		about how to build packages - how to build a distribution). The PowerPC 
		developers are responsible for building and testing packages using this meta-data.
		The meta-data gets marked 'tested' or 'stable' afterwards, depending on the building 
		and testing expierience. Our users can use (but don't have to use) this information 
		to build a system that suits their needs.

	<extraproject name="LiveCD/DVD" lead="pvdabeel">
		<p>The development and maintenance of LiveCD related tools. A livecd is a
		bootable wrapper around a live gentoo environment. A live gentoo environment
		is applied meta-data. This project gives people an opportunity to build 
		and create their own bootable Gentoo LiveCD or LiveDVD. A liveCD/DVD primary
		purpose is to showcase what a concrete realisation of the meta-data will look 
		like. Often Specialized livecds are build; automated distributed cross compile 
		no livecds, Livecds that allow people working on PowerPC hardware development
		to write and test drivers without having to install...
		</p>
		<p>
		The livecd project works closely together with other architectures, developing 
		a generic multi-architecture and multi-platform liveCD/DVD building tool.
		</p>
	</extraproject>

	<extraproject name="Stages" lead="pvdabeel">
		<p>The development and maintenance of 'stage' tarballs. A stage tarball is a
		live environment, packed and compressed into a UNIX tarball. A live environment 
		is applied meta-data. (some packages forming a concrete Gentoo system).
		</p>
		<p>
		The Stages project works closely together with other architectures, developing 
		a generic multi-architecture and multi-platform live environment building tool.
		</p>
		<p>
		This project has a GLEP pending:
		<ul>
		<li>Portage enhancement: allow users to create their own virtual stage 
		    (for instance a desktop stage or a server stage ... ). This functionality
		    will be demo-ed in the portage-ng prototype core.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</extraproject>

	<extraproject name="Stable-profile" lead="darkspecter">
		<p>Maintenance of the profile of packages the PPC team calls 'stable'. The transition 
		from tested to stable meta-date is this team's responsability. If you want to have 
		something listed as stable or report a bug for a stable package, these people are the
		ones to contact. If you have ambitions to become a Gentoo developer, this might be 
		the ideal place to start.

<p>
Can you make computers do amazing things? Are you excited about exploring areas of computing
never explored before? We are continuously looking for volunteers willing to spend some of 
their free time on this project. In return for your work, you get the respect of the PPC 
community.</p>
<p>
If you are interested in helping, but don't have a niche that you are
interested in filling, you can always look through
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>. There
are many many bugs waiting to be found and fixed and many enhancements
looking to find someone to code them. Figure out a fix, implement it,
test it, and then keep trying to make the patch smaller. Post it for
review on <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs.gentoo.org</uri>, and
keep working on it. If it seems ignored, make a new comment in the bug
and/or mention it in #gentoo-ppc.
