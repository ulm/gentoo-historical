                <p>
                  Leadership should be an intuitive process and heavily depends on the people
                  putting their emotions, experiences and expectations in this process.
                </p>

                <p>
                  True and good leadership makes a significant difference to the atmosphere in a project.
                  The positive output of a project increases when leadership is taking place in a structured manner.
                  It should also be noted that the power of a decision making process should not be overloaded
                  with project management tasks like time scheduling, task scheduling and workload balancing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Project leads should concentrate on communication with their team.
                  Most of the time should be spent on consulting and effective
                  skill management of their project members.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This does not mean a project lead cannot work in the team he is leading,
                  it should mean that she or he should be expecting and willing to spend
                  more than 80% of their time coordinating contacts and human relations
                  among the members of the project and also consider this an important task.
                </p>
