			<p>The Gentoo Linux eXtreme Security Project supports the research,
engineering, prototyping and integration of advanced state-of-the-art security
technology.
			</p>

			<p>The technology developed under the umbrella of this project is specifically
aimed at professional environments where system administrators
and security principals of big corporate server landscapes
know how to deal with security incidents, absolutely know their requirements and
are searching for technological challenges and new fields of experience for extending their knowledge about
how to utilize and integrate full-fledged advanced security technologies in order to protect the digital assets of their company.
			</p>
		</longdescription>

		<goals>
			<p>The goal of this project is to provide a friendly, customizable, open, stable, reliable, flexible, security-oriented,
maintainable and extensible development environment for designing and developing security technologies
which can provide a meta-model and a basic foundation for security consultants and technology architects.
			</p>

			<p>The mission will be to successfully design a productive component framework
that can serve as a launchpad for technologies covering a whole suite
of typical information technology security scenarios
which can be found in todays multi-faceted and heterogenous corporate service infrastructures.
