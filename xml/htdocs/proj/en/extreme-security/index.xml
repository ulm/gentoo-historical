        <p>The Gentoo Linux eXtreme Security Project supports the research,
            engineering, prototyping and integration of advanced state-of-the-art
            security technology.
        </p>
        
        <p>The technology developed under the umbrella of this project is specifically
            aimed at professional environments where system administrators
            and security principals of big corporate server landscapes
            know how to deal with security incidents, absolutely know their requirements and
            are searching for technological challenges and new fields of experience for extending their knowledge about
            how to utilize and integrate full-fledged advanced security technologies
            in order to protect the digital assets of their company.

        <p>The mission of this project is to provide a friendly,
            customizable, open, stable, reliable, flexible, security-oriented,
            maintainable and extensible development environment for
            designing and developing security technologies
            which can provide a meta-model and a basic foundation
            for security consultants and technology architects.
        </p>
        
        <p>The mission will be to successfully design a productive component framework
            that can serve as a launchpad for technologies covering a whole suite
            of typical information technology security scenarios
            which can be found in todays multi-faceted and heterogenous
            corporate service infrastructures.
