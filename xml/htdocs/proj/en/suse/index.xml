    <p>The Gentoo SUSE project is the official Gentoo project for the
    maintenance and development of SUSE related products, like
    the Open Build Service. Apart from that, the project members
    will try to make the SUSE technologies Gentoo-compatible. The
    team consists of Gentoo developers who are also SUSE employees,
    but everyone is welcome to join.</p>
