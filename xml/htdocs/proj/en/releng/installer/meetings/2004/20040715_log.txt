Jul 15 19:02:11 <homer> :PP
Jul 15 19:03:25 <cshields> :)
Jul 15 19:03:36 <cshields> let me track down samyron
Jul 15 19:04:45 <cshields> who else is around?
Jul 15 19:04:47 <cshields> esammer?
Jul 15 19:04:51 <cshields> spyderous?
Jul 15 19:06:19 ! samyron [~scott@lateralus.ussg.indiana.edu] has joined #gentoo-installer
Jul 15 19:06:20 <homer> don't worry, i can wait
Jul 15 19:06:28 <samyron> sorry guys, was in the lab, lost track of time
Jul 15 19:07:14 <esammer_> pong
Jul 15 19:08:39 <cshields> esammer_, just a ping on the meeting
Jul 15 19:08:41 <esammer_> i'm working like crazy at the moment, but i'm here
Jul 15 19:08:51 <esammer_> cshields: yea, no problem.
Jul 15 19:09:20 <codeman> i'm lurking at work as well
Jul 15 19:12:04 <samyron> anyone other than the people who spoke already(homer, esammer_ and codeman), ya here?
Jul 15 19:13:58 <cshields> so who is in charge of the meeting?
Jul 15 19:14:20 <esammer_> i believe samyron was the one who called it, correct?
Jul 15 19:14:22 <samyron> yeah
Jul 15 19:14:24 <samyron> it was me
Jul 15 19:14:30 <cshields> you're the man now, dog!
Jul 15 19:14:41 <esammer_> on the other hand, i think if npm, spy, tseng, and klieber are not here, it might be worth waiting
Jul 15 19:14:50 <cshields> true..
Jul 15 19:14:59 <samyron> yeah
Jul 15 19:15:13 <cshields> klieber is here, you just have to kick him a few times before he squeals
Jul 15 19:15:18 <esammer_> heh
Jul 15 19:16:28 <samyron> basically, i want to talk about: What we've done thus far, what needs to get done in the short term, and what long term projects are.
Jul 15 19:16:45 <samyron> IIRC, there hasn't been a cvs commit in a while
Jul 15 19:17:47 <esammer_> samyron: yes. where we are is rather simple and what is left to do is also easy to define (relatively speaking)
Jul 15 19:18:54 <esammer_> we've completed a basic design, implemented profile objects, controller skeleton, utility functions and classes, and done research into some of the more difficult topics such as partitioning.
Jul 15 19:18:59 <samyron> basically, from what I can see, we're stuck on the partitioning
Jul 15 19:19:11 <samyron> here is an idea
Jul 15 19:19:22 <codeman> we can try to work around it
Jul 15 19:19:26 <samyron> because we're currently 'stuck' on partitioning.. lets back burner it for now. I know it's important
Jul 15 19:19:27 <samyron> but
Jul 15 19:19:35 <samyron> we can always partition by hand, then start the installer
Jul 15 19:19:38 <samyron> not optimal
Jul 15 19:19:42 <samyron> but it WOULD work for now
Jul 15 19:19:50 <esammer_> samyron: this is true.
Jul 15 19:19:51 <codeman> and it would allow us to test other things
Jul 15 19:19:56 <samyron> codeman: exactly
Jul 15 19:20:04 <samyron> so basically, let's figure out what else we NEED to do
Jul 15 19:20:07 <samyron> to get SOMETHING working
Jul 15 19:20:11 <samyron> w/o the partitioning
Jul 15 19:20:47 <esammer_> we need to finish the controller with networking setup, routing setup, misc file generation (/etc/hosts, /etc/conf.d/*, etc...)
Jul 15 19:21:22 <samyron> ok
Jul 15 19:21:25 <samyron> that's a start
Jul 15 19:21:37 <samyron> (now there is something to do)
Jul 15 19:21:52 <samyron> Other things that I consider important: a way to download the profile from a given URI
Jul 15 19:21:59 <samyron> that should be simple
Jul 15 19:23:50 <samyron> some sort of profile generator would also be nice, we can probably use "dialog" for that
Jul 15 19:24:17 <esammer_> right. cshields also was thinking of / working on a php web based profile generator which could be neat.
Jul 15 19:24:19 <codeman> we can just make  that by hand
Jul 15 19:24:21 <esammer_> (sorry - phone rang)
Jul 15 19:24:25 <samyron> no prob
Jul 15 19:24:28 <esammer_> codeman: or that, yea. :)
Jul 15 19:24:36 <samyron> codeman: yeah, that's not a problem
Jul 15 19:24:42 <homer> i can, easily, do a profile generator via web, PHP
Jul 15 19:24:49 <codeman> it would be nice if someone could throw up a complete sample profile to CVS
Jul 15 19:24:56 <esammer_> samyron: in short, i agree with what you're saying.
Jul 15 19:25:11 <esammer_> codeman: that may be good, yes. i can probably work that up.
Jul 15 19:25:54 <samyron> codeman: alright
Jul 15 19:26:00 <samyron> codeman: i have a good profile
Jul 15 19:26:19 <esammer_> samyron: maybe check it in as sample_profile.xml or something
Jul 15 19:26:29 ! Netsplit niven.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: mathiaz
Jul 15 19:26:29 <samyron> esammer_: alright, not a problem
Jul 15 19:26:31 ! cshields [~cshields@cshields.developer.gentoo] has quit [Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)]
Jul 15 19:26:46 ! cshields [~cshields@cshields.developer.gentoo] has joined #gentoo-installer
Jul 15 19:26:52 <cshields> ugh..  sorry
Jul 15 19:26:57 <esammer_> ;)
Jul 15 19:27:08 <esammer_>  /kick cshields "Get a real connection, sucka"
Jul 15 19:27:09 <cshields> esammer, yeah..  I can work up a php interface anytime.
Jul 15 19:27:19 <codeman> there were a bunch of little mistakes/typos i found when going through the code, who should i send those to?
Jul 15 19:27:35 <esammer_> codeman: file a bug at bugs.gentoo.org (the GLI module)
Jul 15 19:27:52 <codeman> i've done that b4.
Jul 15 19:28:36 <esammer_> :( i haven't been tending to those bugs as i should. ::raises right hand:: i swear to get on the ball abotu those bugs.
Jul 15 19:28:46 <samyron> hehe
Jul 15 19:28:53 <samyron> not a huge problem at the moment
Jul 15 19:29:53 <samyron> at the moment, GLIInstallProfile is pretty much done
Jul 15 19:29:57 <samyron> except for the partitioning
Jul 15 19:30:02 <samyron> but we'll get to that when we do
Jul 15 19:30:16 <samyron> There are a few things in there that might need to be in GLIClientConfiguration
Jul 15 19:30:24 <samyron> such as set_dns_servers_post
Jul 15 19:30:33 <samyron> (I might have already taken that out)
Jul 15 19:31:34 <samyron> We also need something to "drive" the installer
Jul 15 19:31:48 <samyron> something to open a profile, use it to create a template, etc
Jul 15 19:31:58 <esammer_> samyron: that should be relatively simple (which was hte idea)
Jul 15 19:32:13 <samyron> esammer_: yep, definately, but it's still something that needs to be done :-)
Jul 15 19:32:14 ! cshields [~cshields@cshields.developer.gentoo] has quit [Connection reset by peer]
Jul 15 19:32:17 <samyron> or at least started
Jul 15 19:32:19 <esammer_> samyron: yes
Jul 15 19:32:23 <samyron> so we can start to test various parts of the installer
Jul 15 19:34:10 <codeman> i have really stupid test scripts i can send to someone to build off of
Jul 15 19:34:43 ! cshields [~cshields@cshields.developer.gentoo] has joined #gentoo-installer
Jul 15 19:34:44 <samyron> i'll have quite a bit of time this weekend(my girlfriend is going to be out of town)
Jul 15 19:34:48 <samyron> so feel free to send me stuff
Jul 15 19:34:50 <samyron> samyron@gentoo.org
Jul 15 19:35:29 <codeman> k, will do when i get home tonight
Jul 15 19:36:49 <samyron> *thinks*
Jul 15 19:38:37 <samyron> anything anyone want to bring up?
Jul 15 19:38:38 <samyron> issues?
Jul 15 19:38:39 <samyron> ideas?
Jul 15 19:38:42 <samyron> requests?
Jul 15 19:38:50 <codeman> what else can i do to help?
Jul 15 19:39:03 ! mathiaz [~mathiaz@207.35.88.98] has joined #gentoo-installer
Jul 15 19:39:12 <samyron> at this point, anything  you want, if we need it done
Jul 15 19:39:13 <homer> i want to work with the php profile generator
Jul 15 19:39:20 <esammer_> unfortunately, i'm too wrapped up in work to really think about it, but i'm quite sure there's other stuff we should discuss... my feeling is more feedback and contributions would be helpful.
Jul 15 19:39:55 <samyron> homer, codeman: feel free to email me at ANY time to bring up an idea or whatever
Jul 15 19:39:56 <esammer_> homer: speak with cshields - he was working something out that i'm sure you can get in on
Jul 15 19:41:31 ! cshields [~cshields@cshields.developer.gentoo] has quit [Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)]
Jul 15 19:41:52 <samyron> cshields is having some trouble with gnomemeeting
Jul 15 19:44:12 <homer> i need to learn more english :S
Jul 15 19:44:46 <samyron> it's not that hard :-)
Jul 15 19:44:47 <samyron> lol
Jul 15 19:45:04 <samyron> actually, english is a bitch, as i'm learning (and I'm from the USA... studying for the GRE's)
Jul 15 19:45:26 <codeman> only the chinese do well on the english part of the GREs
Jul 15 19:45:40 <samyron> yeah, because they memorize all of the words...
Jul 15 19:45:43 <codeman> they study
Jul 15 19:45:57 <homer> what is GRE??
Jul 15 19:46:10 <samyron> graduate record exam... to get into graduate school
Jul 15 19:49:28 ! mathiaz [~mathiaz@207.35.88.98] has left #gentoo-installer ["Leaving"]
Jul 15 19:50:18 ! mathiaz [~mathiaz@207.35.88.98] has joined #gentoo-installer
Jul 15 19:52:30 <samyron> well, this meeting was short, but i think it was a bit productive
Jul 15 19:52:35 <samyron> know i know what areas need work
Jul 15 19:52:43 <samyron> and what area we can avoid, for now
Jul 15 19:53:13 <codeman> how much work does the kernel config need?
Jul 15 19:53:37 <codeman> iirc, the kernel modules was being a pain
Jul 15 19:53:47 <homer> yes
Jul 15 19:54:10 <samyron> codeman: what do you mean?
Jul 15 19:54:47 <codeman> well i couldn't test it, but it didn't look close to done
Jul 15 19:57:39 <homer> i will speak with cshields, bye
Jul 15 19:57:47 <homer> good luck
Jul 15 19:57:47 ! homer [~homer@173.Red-80-32-161.pooles.rima-tde.net] has quit ["Leaving"]
Jul 15 19:58:23 <samyron> codeman: test it in what?
Jul 15 19:59:47 <codeman> my test scripts
Jul 15 19:59:53 <samyron> ah
Jul 15 20:05:13 <klieber> sorry I missed the meeting folks.  I had a work meeting that pre-empted it
Jul 15 20:05:27 <samyron> klieber: no prob
Jul 15 20:05:35 <samyron> klieber: any ideas, suggestions, requests?
Jul 15 20:05:39 <klieber> read the backlog -- we can provide hosting stuffs for testing/developing that php profile generator as needed
Jul 15 20:06:17 <samyron> k
Jul 15 20:06:17 <klieber> also, we kind of have GSX Server up and running to where we can provide VMWare environments to folks for testing purposes
Jul 15 20:06:21 <samyron> cool cool
Jul 15 20:06:36 * samyron was playing w/ the GSX server w/ jrinkovs
Jul 15 20:06:38 <klieber> samyron: I stress the "kind of" because you need to beat on jrinkovs to get it fully working.
Jul 15 20:06:55 <samyron> lol
Jul 15 20:06:56 <samyron> ok
