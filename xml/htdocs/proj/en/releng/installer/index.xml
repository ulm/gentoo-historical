  The Gentoo Installer project aims to create an widely extensible install
  engine that allows for a diverse set of attended and un-attended install
  options. All functionality will exist in the backend, exposed through a stable
  API. Planned front ends include text, gtk2, fully automated, and web-based
  interfaces.

    <title>2005-08-08: GLI 0.1 (a.k.a "the alpha") released</title>
    <body>
      <p>We are happy to announce GLI 0.1 (a.k.a "the alpha") along with a
        <e>real</e> LiveCD (usable X environment with goodies) as opposed to the
        normal minimal or universal "LiveCD". It will hit the mirrors under
        <c>/experimental</c> at the same time as the 2005.1 release.</p>

      <p>The LiveCD contains most of the standard GRP set as usable packages.
        This includes (but isn't limited to):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>GNOME</li>
        <li>fluxbox</li>
        <li>enlightenment</li>
        <li>Xfce4</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <li>Thunderbird</li>
        <li>OpenOffice.org (Ximian goodness)</li>
        <li>sylpheed</li>
        <li>xmms</li>
        <li>gaim</li>
        <li>xchat</li>
        <li>mplayer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Obviously, the installer will also be included. In GNOME, there is even
        a handy desktop launcher for the GTK frontend! We have strived to allow
        you to do anything with the installer that you could do if installing
        with the current method. Keep in mind that this is only a first release,
        and there is a lot of room for improvement. Here are some known
        limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>no /etc/portage support in the frontends</li>
        <li>no way to modify runlevels in the frontends</li>
        <li>only supports x86 and probably amd64 (other arches are in the
          works)</li>
        <li>the GTK frontend's make.conf screen only offers a few options</li>
        <li>no way to custom configure a kernel without a premade .config</li>
        <li>no lvm or software raid support</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Of course, to offset these bad things, we have a few features that are
         available with the installer that were not available previously:</p>

       <ul>
         <li><e>livecd-kernel</e> - the installer will install the kernel from the
           LiveCD into the new install so that you don't have to wait for
           genkernel to do its thing. It is installed as a package with emerge
           so that certain dependencies are satisfied (virtual/alsa for
           example)</li>
         <li><e>GRP w/o an extra CD</e> - the installer will <c>quickpkg</c> and
           <c>emerge -K</c> packages from the LiveCD instead of using prebuilt
           binary packages.  This obsoletes the GRP CD, which will probably
           disappear in the next release.</li>
         <li><e>dynamic stage3</e> - the installer can build a stage3 equivalent in the
           chroot directory from the packages on the CD. This will be useful
           down the road for networkless installs.  Currently, there is no
           snapshot on the LiveCD for space reasons, but play with it
           anyway.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Along with the GTK frontend, there is also a dialog-based frontend.
         This is useful for doing remote installs via SSH. <c>gli-dialog</c>
         also supports some things that the GTK frontend doesn't and vice versa.
         If not using gnome, the installer can be started by running
         '<c>installer</c>' from a terminal. This will try to launch the GTK
         frontend first with the '<c>installer-gtk</c>' script. If this fails,
         it will fall back to the dialog installer with the
         '<c>installer-dialog</c>' script.  If you wish to use the dialog
         frontend, you can run '<c>installer-dialog</c>' directly.</p>

       <p>Now, for the <e>most</e> important part...reporting bugs. Gentoo's
         bugzilla has a special sub-section for the installer. When you click
         the link to enter a new bug report, select "Gentoo Linux" and then
         "GLI" from the "Component" list.  Please search for the bug you're
         reporting <e>before</e> creating a new bug.  We would much rather see
         "me too" comments, or even the much more silent act of adding yourself
         to the bug's CC, than having to deal with tons of duplicate bugs.  When
         you do encounter an error in the installer, try to grab
         <c>/tmp/installprofile.xml</c> and <c>/var/log/install.log</c> from the
         LiveCD environment.  We may request them when you file a bug.</p>

       <p>If you've actually made it this far, congratulations for having an
         attention span greater than that of the average 3 year old!  Happy
         installing :)</p>
