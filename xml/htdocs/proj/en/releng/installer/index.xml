The <b>deprecated</b> Gentoo Installer project aimed to create an widely
extensible install engine that allowed for a diverse set of attended and
unattended install options. All functionality existed in the backend, exposed
through a stable API. Planned front ends included text, gtk2, fully automated,
and web-based interfaces. The project was <b>abandoned in 2009</b> when the
Gentoo Release Engineering team profoundly changed the way releases are done,
automating and simplifying the process in many ways, making distinct livecd
releases obsolete.

<title>2009-01-13: GLI Officially Deprecated</title>
<body>
<p>
A few months ago the Gentoo Release Engineering team changed the way that
releases are done to simplify, automate, and provide more current release media
on a more regular basis.  One of the consequences of this is that the
livecds are no longer being released.  This leaves the installer with no place
or function.  The installer developers have all moved on to other 
projects, leaving GLI in an unmaintained state.  We can no longer offer support
for the 2008.0-r1 LiveCDs for x86 and amd64, though we expect it to work for 
those that use it.  During this project's five year existence, it has been both
a pride for Gentoo and a source of controversy.  The Gentoo Handbook is still 
the official installation method for Gentoo.  For those still seeking 
to do automated gentoo installs, please see the 
<uri link="http://agaffney.org/quickstart.php">Quickstart</uri> 
project.

<title>2008-07-07: GLI 0.6.6 released</title>
<body>
<p>
The Gentoo Linux Installer team has released version 0.6.6 of the installer
on the 2008.0-r1 LiveCDs for x86 and amd64.  The improvements in this release
are intended to improve the stability and simplicity of the installation
(yes, we know, at the expense of customizability).  For more details,
please see the <uri link="release-0.6.txt">full release announcement</uri>.
You can get the latest LiveCD from your local <uri
link="/main/en/where.xml">mirror</uri> or <uri
link="http://torrents.gentoo.org">bittorrent</uri>.

<title>2007-05-07: GLI 0.5 released</title>
<body>
<p><b>Update: We are aware of networkless issues on the amd64 livecd. A -r1
release is in the works to fix this issue.  Please avoid trying networkless
installations using the amd64 livecd for the time being.</b></p>
<p>
Along with the release of Gentoo Linux 2007.0, the Gentoo Linux Installer 
team is accouncing version 0.5[.4] of GLI. 
This release marks the first step in a larger overhaul of how the installer
works.  Whereas before it was automated, it is now interactive and does the
installation as you progress through the frontends.  For automated installations,
see the quickstart project mentioned in the release announcement.
You can get the latest LiveCD from your local <uri
link="/main/en/where.xml">mirror</uri> or <uri
link="http://torrents.gentoo.org">bittorrent</uri>.
