  The Gentoo Installer project aims to create an widely extensible install
  engine that allows for a diverse set of attended and un-attended install
  options. All functionality will exist in the backend, exposed through a stable
  API. Planned front ends include text, gtk2, fully automated, and web-based
  interfaces.

		<title>2005-11-21: GLI 0.2 released</title>
		<body>
			<p>The installer team is proud to announce the release of version 0.2 of the
				Gentoo Linux Installer. There have been many improvements over the 0.1 ("alpha")
				release including many new features and many annoying bugs squished.</p>
			<p>As always, you can get the LiveCD from the <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>
				under <c>/experimental</c>.</p>
			<p>New Features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sub-progress bar (shows the progress of the individual install step)</li>
				<li>Tarball extraction progress (shows how far along it is extracting a tarball)</li>
				<li>New code for dynamic-stage3 that cuts the time in half along with not cluttering up your new install with binary packages.</li>
				<li>Optional verbose logging for debug purposes.</li>
				<li>Notification of which packages are available in GRP form (gli-dialog only)</li>
				<li>More graceful failure cleanup (now unmounts mounted partitions) (gtkfe only)</li>
				<li>Pre-configured xorg.conf is now copied to the new system when xorg-x11 is installed.</li>
				<li>If selecting a graphical desktop xdm is set to boot automatically in standard mode (prompt in advanced) (gli-dialog only)</li>
				<li>Automatic snapshot/make.conf screens for dynamic stage3 installs (this is necessary to prevent b0rkage)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Bugs fixed since 0.1</p>
			<ul>
				<li>NTFS/FAT32 code problem that left you with an empty partition table</li>
				<li>Attempting to mount unallocated space</li>
				<li>Various bootloader bugs</li>
			</ul>

    <title>2005-08-08: GLI 0.1 (a.k.a "the alpha") released</title>
    <body>
      <p>We are happy to announce GLI 0.1 (a.k.a "the alpha") along with a
        <e>real</e> LiveCD (usable X environment with goodies) as opposed to the
        normal minimal or universal "LiveCD". It is currently available from the 
		<uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri> under <c>/experimental</c>.</p>

      <p>The LiveCD contains most of the standard GRP set as usable packages.
        This includes (but isn't limited to):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>GNOME</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <li>Thunderbird</li>
        <li>OpenOffice.org (Ximian goodness)</li>
        <li>sylpheed</li>
        <li>xmms</li>
        <li>gaim</li>
        <li>xchat</li>
        <li>mplayer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Obviously, the installer will also be included. In GNOME, there is even
        a handy desktop launcher for the GTK frontend! We have strived to allow
        you to do anything with the installer that you could do if installing
        with the current method. Keep in mind that this is only a first release,
        and there is a lot of room for improvement. Here are some known
        limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>no /etc/portage customization support in the frontends</li>
        <li>no way to modify runlevels for services in the frontends</li>
        <li>only supports x86 and probably amd64 (other arches are in the
          works)</li>
        <li>the GTK frontend's make.conf screen only offers a few options</li>
        <li>no way to custom configure a kernel without a premade .config</li>
        <li>no lvm or software raid support</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Of course, to offset these bad things, we have a few features that are
         available with the installer that were not available previously:</p>

       <ul>
         <li><e>livecd-kernel</e> - the installer will install the kernel from the
           LiveCD into the new install so that you don't have to wait for
           genkernel to do its thing. It is installed as a package with emerge
           so that certain dependencies are satisfied (virtual/alsa for
           example)</li>
         <li><e>GRP w/o an extra CD</e> - the installer will <c>quickpkg</c> and
           <c>emerge -K</c> packages from the LiveCD instead of using prebuilt
           binary packages.  This obsoletes the GRP CD, which will probably
           disappear in the next release.</li>
         <li><e>dynamic stage3</e> - the installer can build a stage3 equivalent in the
           chroot directory from the packages on the CD. This will be useful
           down the road for networkless installs.  Currently, there is no
           snapshot on the LiveCD for space reasons, but play with it
           anyway.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Along with the GTK frontend, there is also a dialog-based frontend.
         This is useful for doing remote installs via SSH. <c>gli-dialog</c>
         also supports some things that the GTK frontend doesn't and vice versa.
         If not using gnome, the installer can be started by running
         '<c>installer</c>' from a terminal. This will try to launch the GTK
         frontend first with the '<c>installer-gtk</c>' script. If this fails,
         it will fall back to the dialog installer with the
         '<c>installer-dialog</c>' script.  If you wish to use the dialog
         frontend, you can run '<c>installer-dialog</c>' directly.</p>
		 
	   <p>Other features of the dialog frontend include "standard" and "advanced"
	     installation modes, where in the "standard" mode the default input for
		 common steps will be automatically given.  The dialog frontend also includes
		 a detailed explanation of all steps for those not as experienced with installing
		 Gentoo.  It also supports custom kernel uri's and will load a list of mirrors for
		 the stage tarball selection.  Internationalization support is almost complete for
		 this frontend.</p>

       <p>Now, for the <e>most</e> important part...reporting <uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugs</uri>. Gentoo's
         bugzilla has a special sub-section for the installer. When you click
         the link to enter a new bug report, select "Gentoo Linux" and then
         "GLI" from the "Component" list.  Please search for the bug you're
         reporting <e>before</e> creating a new bug.  We would much rather see
         "me too" comments, or even the much more silent act of adding yourself
         to the bug's CC, than having to deal with tons of duplicate bugs.  When
         you do encounter an error in the installer, try to grab
         <c>/tmp/installprofile.xml</c> and <c>/var/log/install.log</c> from the
         LiveCD environment.  We may request them when you file a bug.</p>
