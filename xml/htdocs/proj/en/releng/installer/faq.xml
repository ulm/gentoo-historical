<title>General</title>

<section id="livecds">
<title>
  Will the installer run from the 2005.1 minimal/universal CD?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. At the minimum, the installer requires parted, pyparted, and pythondialog
which are not on the official release CDs.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="done">
<title>
  Is the installer done?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No, it will be done when it's done.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="usable">
<title>
  Can I use it yet?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, but it's only at version 0.1 and still has many bugs. You can obtain an
experimental ISO with X and the installer at /experimental/x86/livecd/x86/ on
your favorite mirror. The file is called livecd-x86-2005.1, however the name is
subject to change.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="archsupport">
<title>
  Does/will the installer support architecture X?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The first release of the installer is only planned to support x86 and amd64.
There are plans to support sparc, hppa, and ppc in the future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="reiser">
<title>
  Why can't I create a ReiserFS filesystem with the installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The backend of the installer currently supports <e>creating</e> a reiser3
filesystem, but the GTK frontend does not currently offer it as a choice.
Mainly, this is because libparted doesn't support it very well. Also, we have
very little experience with it. The "final" version of the installer will
support creating and resizing reiserfs. Be patient. The installer will
<e>not</e> support reiser4 until it is much more stable (filesystem tools work
on more architectures and it doesn't eat data).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="raid">
<title>
  Does/will the installer support LVM/RAID?
</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are using true hardware RAID, the installer will see the array as a
normal drive (because the kernel sees it this way too). As for LVM and fake
RAID/md, the installer does not currently support them, but it will in the
future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="feature">
<title>
  Why doesn't the installer do such and such?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The installer is currently under heavy development and is only in its alpha
stage. Our intention is to support everything you can do from the commandline
in the installer itself. If you have time and are willing to help on a feature,
see the section titled "How can I help?"
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="force">
<title>
  I like the manual install. Why are you forcing me to use a graphical
  installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The current install method will always be an option. The installer will be
distributed on a true LiveCD that contains xorg, Gnome, fluxbox, mozilla, and
other goodies. There will still be a minimal LiveCD that has just enough stuff
to boot and install by hand.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="hard">
<title>
  Gentoo is too hard to install and I feel like whining.
</title>
<body>

<p>
See question 1.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="autoconfigure">
<title>
  Will the gentoo installer configure my such and such hardware for me?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. The installer will only do what is covered in the install guide.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="info">
<title>
  Where can I find more information about the installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
On the project pages.  Currently, there is no documentation. You can either read
the source or ask in #gentoo-installer. If you ask any questions covered by this
FAQ, you will most likely be ignored.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="wrong">
<title>
  What's wrong with the current installation method?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Absolutely nothing. The goal of the installer is to make installations faster,
not easier. The original intention was to make an installer for doing automated
deployments. While we still have this in mind, the end user aspect took
precedence (mainly because it's prettier).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="language">
<title>
  What language is the installer written in?
</title>
<body>

<p>
COBOL, of course! (it's actually python)
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="localization">
<title>
  Does the installer have localization support?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Some basic code for localization of the frontends has been written, but it has
not been integrated yet.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="assistance">
<title>
  How can I help?
</title>
<body>

<p>
At the current time, we need testers. If you are good with python, take a look
at the various TODO lists in the latest CVS snapshot. Otherwise, we'll accept
good bug reports (/tmp/installprofile.xml and /var/log/install*log included
from failures). In the near future, we will also need people to write
documentation.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="bugs">
<title>
  Where do I file bugs?
</title>
<body>

<p>
It depends on if it's a bug with the installer itself or the LiveCD that it's
on. If it's an installer bug, file it under Gentoo Linux in the GLI component
on bugs.gentoo.org. If you had an install failure, include the
/tmp/installprofile.xml and /var/log/install*log files from the LiveCD (you'll
need to grab these before you reboot). If it is a bug with the LiveCD, file it
under "Gentoo LiveCD (all flavors)", choose 2005.1 from the version list, and
put "X LiveCD" or "installer LiveCD" somewhere in the summary.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="newerversion">
<title>
  Can I update the installer on the LiveCD?
</title>
<body>

<p>
There is a script provided that will download the latest CVS snapshot and
extract it into the current directory. To get the latest version and start the
GTK frontend, do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>open a terminal</li>
  <li>xhost +</li>
  <li>sudo su -</li>
  <li>/opt/installer/misc/getgli</li>
  <li>export DISPLAY=:0.0</li>
  <li>cd installer/src/fe/gtk</li>
  <li>./gtkfe.py</li>
</ul>
<p>To update the dialog frontend, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>open a terminal</li>
  <li>sudo su -</li>
  <li>/opt/installer/misc/getgli</li>
  <li>cd installer/src/fe/dialog</li>
  <li>./gli-dialog.py</li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section id="foundbug">
<title>
  I found a bug. What should I do?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Since this is still alpha software, there are bound to be bugs. Since the
initial release, we have fixed many bugs that testers have reported. Among them
are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>install hangs at "Mounting local partitions" if there is unallocated
      space in your partition layout</li>
  <li>install hangs at "Mounting local partitions" if you have 2 drives and
      the second one contains no partitions</li>
  <li>"iteration over non-sequence" error when using lilo</li>
  <li>http/ftp_proxy being set incorrectly</li>
  <li>choosing anything other than livecd-kernel in GTK frontend causes the
      bootloader to fail to install</li>
  <li>partitioning fails when leaving NTFS partition intact</li>
  <li>choosing "none" for cron daemon tries to 'emerge none'</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are also some commonly reported errors that are <e>not</e> installer
bugs. The most common one is the install failing when trying to sync the
portage tree when using the normal sync option. This is actually a portage bug.
This bug has been fixed in later portage versions, but not in any of the
released stage tarballs. For now, it can be worked around by using the snapshot
or webrsync options.
</p>
<p>
If you've found a bug that isn't mentioned above, the first thing you should do
is follow the directions above for grabbing and running the latest CVS
snapshot. If you can reproduce the bug there, you should go to
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org">bugzilla</uri> and do a search for the
problem that you're running into. If there isn't an existing bug (open or
closed), you can file a new bug under in the "Gentoo Linux" section in the GLI
component. Be sure to save /tmp/installprofile.xml and /var/log/installer.log
from the livecd after your installer run. These files are essential for us to
be able to debug the problem properly.

<section id="voice">
<title>
  How can I get voice in #gentoo-installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Asking a question covered in this FAQ will get you kicked and possibly banned
from the channel. If you are trying to use the installer without first having
successfully completed an install using the existing method, go away. At this
point, we are looking for bug testers. We only want meaningful bug reports, and
it's hard to get to those through the flood of "what is a stage tarball URI?"
and similar questions. We also do not care that you think the installer is
stupid, will ruin Gentoo, etc. Once you have read through this FAQ, just join
the channel and '/msg gibot voiceme' to get voice.
