<section id="installproblem">
<title>
  I'm installing Gentoo (not using the installer) and I have a problem...
</title>
<body>

<p>
What does this have to do with the installer? Oh, that's right, nothing. Go to
#gentoo or bugs.gentoo.org.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="livecds">
<title>
  Will the installer run from the 2005.0 LiveCD?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. At the minimum, the installer requires parted, pyparted, and pythondialog
which are not on the official LiveCDs.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="done">
<title>
  Is the installer done?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No, it will be done when it's done.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="eta">
<title>
  When will the installer be done?
</title>
<body>

<p>
See question 3.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="usable">
<title>
  Can I use it yet?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, it is usable but not without a custom LiveCD. There will be an alpha
version available very soon along with an experimental X LiveCD.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="archsupport">
<title>
  Does/will the installer support architecture X?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The first release of the installer is only planned to support x86 and amd64.
There are plans to support sparc, hppa, and ppc in the future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="reiser">
<title>
  Why can't I create a ReiserFS filesystem with the installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Because reiserfs == teh suck...and libparted doesn't support it very well.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="raid">
<title>
  Does/will the installer support LVM/RAID?
</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are using true hardware RAID, the installer will see the array as a
normal drive (because the kernel sees it this way too). As for LVM and fake
RAID/md, the installer does not currently support them but it will in the
future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="feature">
<title>
  Why doesn't the installer do such and such?
</title>
<body>

<p>
It's an alpha for crying out loud.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="force">
<title>
  I like the manual install. Why are you forcing me to use a graphical
  installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The current install method will always be an option. The installer will be
distributed on a true LiveCD that contains xorg, Gnome, fluxbox, mozilla, and
other goodies. There will still be a minimal LiveCD that has just enough stuff
to boot and install by hand.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="hard">
<title>
  Gentoo is too hard to install and I feel like whining.
</title>
<body>

<p>
See question 1.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="autoconfigure">
<title>
  Will the gentoo installer configure my such and such hardware for me?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. The installer will only do what is covered in the install guide.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="info">
<title>
  Where can I find more information about the installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
On the project pages.  Currently, there is no documentation. You can either read
the source or ask in #gentoo-installer. If you ask any questions covered by this
FAQ, you will most likely be ignored.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="wrong">
<title>
  What's wrong with the current installation method?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Absolutely nothing. The goal of the installer is to make installations faster,
not easier. The original intention was to make an installer for doing automated
deployments. While we still have this in mind, the end user aspect took
precedence (mainly because it's prettier).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="language">
<title>
  What language is the installer written in?
</title>
<body>

<p>
COBOL, of course! (it's actually python)
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="localization">
<title>
  Does the installer have localization support?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Some basic code for localization of the frontends has been written, but it has
not been integrated yet.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="assistance">
<title>
  How can I help?
</title>
<body>

<p>
At the current time, we need testers (an alpha will be available shortly). If
you are good with python, take a look at the various TODO lists in the latest
CVS snapshot. In the near future, we will also need people to write
documentation.
