<section id="installproblem">
<title>
  I'm installing Gentoo (not using the installer) and I have a problem...
</title>
<body>

<p>
What does this have to do with the installer? Oh, that's right, nothing. Go to
#gentoo or bugs.gentoo.org.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="livecds">
<title>
  Will the installer run from the 2005.1 minimal/universal CD?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. At the minimum, the installer requires parted, pyparted, and pythondialog
which are not on the official release CDs.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="done">
<title>
  Is the installer done?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No, it will be done when it's done.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="eta">
<title>
  When will the installer be done?
</title>
<body>

<p>
See the previous question.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="usable">
<title>
  Can I use it yet?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Yes, but it's only at version 0.1 and still has many bugs. You can obtain an
experimental ISO with X and the installer at /experimental/x86/livecd/x86/ on
your favorite mirror. The file is called livecd-x86-2005.1, however the name is
subject to change.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="archsupport">
<title>
  Does/will the installer support architecture X?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The first release of the installer is only planned to support x86 and amd64.
There are plans to support sparc, hppa, and ppc in the future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="reiser">
<title>
  Why can't I create a ReiserFS filesystem with the installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Because reiserfs == teh suck...and libparted doesn't support it very well.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="raid">
<title>
  Does/will the installer support LVM/RAID?
</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are using true hardware RAID, the installer will see the array as a
normal drive (because the kernel sees it this way too). As for LVM and fake
RAID/md, the installer does not currently support them but it will in the
future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="feature">
<title>
  Why doesn't the installer do such and such?
</title>
<body>

<p>
It's an alpha for crying out loud.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="force">
<title>
  I like the manual install. Why are you forcing me to use a graphical
  installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
The current install method will always be an option. The installer will be
distributed on a true LiveCD that contains xorg, Gnome, fluxbox, mozilla, and
other goodies. There will still be a minimal LiveCD that has just enough stuff
to boot and install by hand.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="hard">
<title>
  Gentoo is too hard to install and I feel like whining.
</title>
<body>

<p>
See question 1.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="autoconfigure">
<title>
  Will the gentoo installer configure my such and such hardware for me?
</title>
<body>

<p>
No. The installer will only do what is covered in the install guide.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="info">
<title>
  Where can I find more information about the installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
On the project pages.  Currently, there is no documentation. You can either read
the source or ask in #gentoo-installer. If you ask any questions covered by this
FAQ, you will most likely be ignored.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="wrong">
<title>
  What's wrong with the current installation method?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Absolutely nothing. The goal of the installer is to make installations faster,
not easier. The original intention was to make an installer for doing automated
deployments. While we still have this in mind, the end user aspect took
precedence (mainly because it's prettier).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="language">
<title>
  What language is the installer written in?
</title>
<body>

<p>
COBOL, of course! (it's actually python)
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="localization">
<title>
  Does the installer have localization support?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Some basic code for localization of the frontends has been written, but it has
not been integrated yet.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="assistance">
<title>
  How can I help?
</title>
<body>

<p>
At the current time, we need testers. If you are good with python, take a look
at the various TODO lists in the latest CVS snapshot. Otherwise, we'll accept
good bug reports (/tmp/installprofile.xml and /var/log/install*log included
from failures). In the near future, we will also need people to write
documentation.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="voice">
<title>
  How can I get voice in #gentoo-installer?
</title>
<body>

<p>
Asking a question covered in this FAQ will get you kicked and possibly banned
from the channel. If you are trying to use the installer without first having
successfully completed an install using the existing method, go away. At this
point, we are looking for bug testers. We only want meaningful bug reports, and
it's hard to get to those through the flood of "what is a stage tarball URI?"
and similar questions. We also do not care that you think the installer is
stupid, will ruin Gentoo, etc. Once you have read through this FAQ, just join
the channel and '/msg gibot voiceme' to get voice.
