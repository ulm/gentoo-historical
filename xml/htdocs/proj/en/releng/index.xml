<longdescription>
Release Engineering ("releng") is the official Gentoo top-level project focused
on coordinating and improving the creation of official releases of Gentoo Linux.
</longdescription>

<goals>
The goal of Release Engineering is to continually improve the quality,
timeliness and overall procedures for creating official Gentoo Linux releases,
as well as acting as the official coordinators for creating new Gentoo Linux
releases. This project is very much focused on ensuring that the initial
quality of every official release is as high as possible, and that the "from
CD" experience is as positive for as many of our users as possible.

The <uri link="http://store.gentoo.org">Gentoo Store</uri> is not an official Release Engineering sub-project, but the Store and
Release Engineering coordinate very closely. All official Gentoo Linux releases are made available
in the Gentoo Store. In addition, all maintenance releases are made available in the Gentoo Store as
soon as possible, so that customers can benefit from the latest fixes and improvements.

<extraproject name="build/research hardware" lead="drobbins">
Release Engineering maintains its own set of hardware for development, testing and release-building, as well as the
porting of Gentoo Linux to new architectures. Currently, this hardware consists of a dual-CPU 900Mhz zx6000 Itanium 2 system with 10GB of
RAM on extended loan from HP, an NForce3-based AMD64 system donated by NVIDIA, and a G4-based Mac. All systems are running Gentoo Linux, and
access is provided to these systems for those interested in assisting the <e>amd64</e>, <e>ppc</e> and <e>ia64</e> ports, as well as those in the
general Linux/free software community who need access to these architectures to perform porting/QA work. If you are a developer
(Gentoo Linux or otherwise) who could benefit from access to these boxes, please contact <mail link="drobbins@gentoo.org">Daniel Robbins</mail>.</extraproject>

<p>Releng uses a quarterly release schedule, with planned 2004
releases in:</p>
	
<table>
<tr><th>Release name</th><th>Release date</th></tr>
<tr><ti>Gentoo Linux 2004</ti><ti>January 2004</ti></tr>

<p>We may release more often than this, depending on the need for maintenance
releases. After the initial release of the year (2004), each subsequent release
will be labeled with an ".1," ".2," ".3," suffix. This means that it is
possible that we may have a 2004.4 or 2004.5 release.</p>
