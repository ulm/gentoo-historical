<goals>
The goal of Release Engineering is to continually improve the quality,
timeliness and overall procedures for creating official Gentoo Linux releases,
as well as acting as the official coordinators for creating new Gentoo Linux
releases. This project is very much focused on ensuring that the initial
quality of every official release is as high as possible, and that the "from
CD" experience is as positive for as many of our users as possible.

			Every release consists of an offical version number, such as "1.4", and a number of architectures
			that are officially supported. Part of the Gentoo Linux release policy is generally not hold up a
			release if certain less-popular architectures are not quite ready; therefore, an official release
			of Gentoo Linux may not offer builds for all the architectures for which there are ongoing development
			efforts. In addition, every architecture that is part of an official release includes the following
			components:
