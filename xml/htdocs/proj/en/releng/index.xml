The <uri link="http://store.gentoo.org">Gentoo Store</uri> is not an official Release Engineering sub-project, but the Store and
Release Engineering coordinate very closely. All official Gentoo Linux releases are made available
in the Gentoo Store. In addition, all maintenance releases are made available in the Gentoo Store as
soon as possible, so that customers can benefit from the latest fixes and improvements.

<extraproject name="build/research hardware" lead="drobbins">
Release Engineering maintains its own set of hardware for development, testing and release-building, as well as the
porting of Gentoo Linux to new architectures. Currently, this hardware consists of a dual-CPU 900Mhz zx6000 Itanium 2 system with 10GB of
RAM on extended loan from HP, an NForce3-based AMD64 system donated by NVIDIA, and a G4-based Mac. All systems are running Gentoo Linux, and
access is provided to these systems for those interested in assisting the <e>amd64</e>, <e>ppc</e> and <e>ia64</e> ports, as well as those in the
general Linux/free software community who need access to these architectures to perform porting/QA work. If you are a developer
(Gentoo Linux or otherwise) who could benefit from access to these boxes, please contact <mail>drobbins@gentoo.org</mail>.</extraproject>

<goals>
The goal of Release Engineering is to continually improve the quality,
timeliness and overall procedures for creating official Gentoo Linux releases,
as well as acting as the official coordinators for creating new Gentoo Linux
releases. This project is very much focused on ensuring that the initial
quality of every official release is as high as possible, and that the "from
CD" experience is as positive for as many of our users as possible.

	<title>What consititutes a release?</title>
		<section>
		<body>
		<p>
			Every release consists of an offical version number, such as "1.4", and a number of architectures
			that are officially supported. Part of the Gentoo Linux release policy is to generally not hold up a
			release if certain less-popular architectures are not quite ready; therefore, an official release
			of Gentoo Linux may not offer builds for all the architectures for which there are ongoing development
			efforts.
		</p><p>
			In addition, every architecture that is part of an official release includes the following
			components:
		
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>stage tarballs</li>
			<li>portage snapshot</li>
			<li>livecd runtime environment</li>
			<li>pre-built packages</li>
			<li>installation documentation</li>

	<title>Gentoo Linux 2004 Overview (draft)</title>
		<section>
		<body>
		
<p>For the next release of Gentoo Linux, we will be transitioning to a date-based
versioning scheme. The next Gentoo Linux release will be named "Gentoo Linux
2004."</p>

<p>Releng will be moving to a quarterly release schedule, with planned 2004
releases in:</p>
	
<table>
<tr><th>Release name</th><th>Release date</th></tr>
<tr><ti>Gentoo Linux 2004</ti><ti>January 2004</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>Gentoo Linux 2004.1</ti><ti>April 2004</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>Gentoo Linux 2004.2</ti><ti>July 2004</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>Gentoo Linux 2004.3</ti><ti>October 2004</ti></tr>
</table>

<p>We may release more often than this, depending on the need for maintenance
releases. After the initial release of the year (2004), each subsequent release
will be labeled with an ".1," ".2," ".3," suffix. This means that it is
possible that we may have a 2004.4 or 2004.5 release.</p>

<p>
The release of Gentoo Linux 2004 will mark a number of important transitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Our transition to Gentoo Handbook install documentation for all architectures.
 The Gentoo Handbook is designed to provide a comprehensive guide covering all
 aspects of Gentoo Linux installation and, as it continues to be developed,
 usage.
</li>
<li>
 The use of catalyst to build all stages, packages and LiveCDs for all
 architectures. The build process for Gentoo Linux 2004 will be fully scripted
 and automated for improved consistency, repeatability, maintainability, and to
 allow users to rebuild any release of Gentoo Linux using catalyst.
</li>
<li>
 The introduction of official Release Notes for each architecture. The Release
 Notes will contain information related to the specific arch release, including
 improvements since last release, system requirements and compatibility
 information, errata and security fixes. The release notes will be actively
 maintained for each architecture until the next official Gentoo Linux release
 for this architecture is made, at which point they will be superceded by
 the new release notes.
</li>
<li>
In addition to Release Notes, we will also be implementing an XML-based GLSA
system with XSL for HTML rendering of this data on our Web site. This will allow
GLSAs to be referenced by URL from Release Notes.</li>

 <li> 2.6 kernels will be supported as an option on architectures that are ready
 to make this transition. In addition, updated 2.4 kernels will be offered
 where possible.
</li>
<li>
 The XFCE4 desktop environment will be added to our official pre-built package
 offerings, bringing the number of desktop environments (other than window
 managers) offered by Gentoo to three (GNOME, KDE, XFCE4)
</li>
<li>
 An OpenOffice 1.1 .tbz2 package will be included on all architectures that
 are able to support it. Gentoo Linux 1.4 provided an openoffice-bin package
 that did not function properly.
 </li>
 <li>
 We will attempt to offer an official release for the AMD64 architecture.
</li>
<li>
 We will mirror .tbz2s for each release on our mirrors, and document and
 support Portage's new "install packages from network" functionality.
</li>
<li>
 We will have an active, coordinated release testing effort organized by the QA
 top-level project and the respective arch leads.
</li>
</ul>
