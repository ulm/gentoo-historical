<longdescription>
This project develops the catalyst tool, which is used to build official Gentoo
stage tarballs, packages and LiveCDs. This tool is designed to be easy to
use, customize, extend and maintain.
</longdescription>

<goals>
<p>The goal of the catalyst project is to provide a single multi-faceted tool that
can reliably build all aspects of a Gentoo Linux release: stage tarballs, GRP package
sets and LiveCDs.</p>

<p>Our specific development goals for <c>catalyst</c> include the following: ensuring it
provides high-quality builds of Gentoo Linux, and for the tool to be easy to use, customize,
extend and maintain. The catalyst tool is intended to be used by those who wish to
create their own customized versions of Gentoo Linux, or their own customized LiveCDs.
Our goal is to make catalyst a powerful tool that's a pleasure to use, and to ensure
that the code we write is maintainable and of high-quality.

	<title>Catalyst Installation and Usage Documentation</title>
	<section>
	<title>Installation</title>
	<body>
	<p>Here's how to use catalyst. First, either check it out of CVS (at <path>gentoo/src/catalyst</path>) or download a snapshot from <uri>http://dev.gentoo.org/~drobbins/catalyst</uri>. Unpack the directory, and then create an <path>/etc/catalyst.conf</path> that looks like this:</p>

	<pre caption="Example /etc/catalyst.conf">
distdir="/mnt/misc/distfiles"
options="ccache pkgcache"
sharedir="/home/drobbins/cvs/gentoo/src/catalyst"
	</pre>
	
	<p>The <c>sharedir</c> variable tells catalyst where to find its various
	plugins, and should point to the main catalyst directory that you
	created. the <c>options</c> variable is used to turn on <c>.tbz2</c> package
	caching, which is off by default (you'll likely want it on, however.)
	Also, <c>distdir</c> is used here to tell catalyst where to look/store
	distfiles. The default is <path>/usr/portage/distfiles</path>. If you wish to use
	the default setting, simply omit the line from your config file.
	</p>

	<p>Here are other variables you can set, and their default values.
	Please remember that <b>strings must be quoted</b>, as <path>/etc/catalyst.conf</path>
	uses python syntax:</p>

	<table>
	<tr><th>variable</th><th>default value</th><th>description</th></tr>

	<tr><ti><c>storedir</c></ti><ti><path>/var/tmp/catalyst</path></ti><ti>Parent directory for all building and storing of completed builds</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>sharedir</c></ti><ti><path>/usr/share/catalyst</path></ti><ti>Where the main directory for catalyst is located</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>distdir</c></ti><ti><path>/usr/portage/distfiles</path></ti><ti>Where catalyst should look for distfiles</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>portdir</c></ti><ti><path>/usr/portage</path></ti><ti>Portage tree that catalyst will use for creating Portage tree snapshots</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>options</c></ti><ti><c>ccache</c></ti><ti>Catalyst options/extensions that are enabled. Others: <c>pkgcache</c></ti></tr>
	</table>

	<p>You may also want to create a <path>/usr/bin/catalyst</path> symlink that points to the
	real location of your catalyst executable script.</p>

	<title>First Steps -- Creating a Portage Tree Snapshot</title>
	<body>
	<p>Catalyst works by using Portage tree snapshots, which are nothing more than tarballs containing
	an entire Portage tree. Portage tree snapshots are used so that catalyst can deliver consistent results -- using the same Portage tree snapshot and catalyst settings, two different people on two different machines should be able to build identical stages. This is an important design characteristic of catalyst.</p>

	<p>Before you generate a Portage tree snapshot, first make sure that the Portage tree you'll be
	snapshotting meets these basic requirements. Your snapshot should be from 06 Nov 2003 at the earliest,
	and <path>portage-2.0.49-r15</path> or later should be unmasked for the architecture for which you
	will be building.</p>

	<p><b>IMPORTANT (for Gentoo developers only):</b> If you are a Gentoo
	arch lead, make sure that the <c>GRP_STAGE23_USE</c> variable is
	defined in your profile's <path>make.defaults</path> file.
	<c>GRP_STAGE23_USE</c> will tell catalyst what <c>USE</c> variables
	should be enabled when stage2 and stage3 are built. Without
	<c>GRP_STAGE23_USE</c> defined in your <path>make.defaults</path> file,
	your stages may not work properly. <c>GRP_STAGE23_USE</c> is necessary
	to prevent packages like <path>db</path> from pulling in a JDK as a dependency
	simply because <c>java</c> is enabled in <c>USE</c> in your profile, and <c>db</c>
	recognizes the <c>java</c> USE variable.</p>

	<p>To create a snapshot of your Portage tree, type:</p>

	<pre caption="Generating a snapshot with catalyst">
# catalyst target=snapshot version_stamp=20031102
</pre>

	<p>Assuming you are using the default <c>storedir</c> setting of <path>/var/tmp/catalyst</path>,
	the following file will be created:</p>

	<pre>
/var/tmp/catalyst/snapshots/portage-20031102.tar.bz2
	</pre>

	<p>Now that you have a snapshot, you can prepare catalyst to build a stage, GRP set, LiveCD,
	or do a tinderbox build for QA purposes.</p>

	<title>Targets, Architectures and Sub-Architectures</title>
	<body>
	<p>Catalyst supports a variety of targets, architectures and sub-architectures. I'll explain
	what each of these terms mean. A "target" is an end-product that catalyst can build for you.
	For example, a stage1 tarball is a target. A Portage tree snapshot is a target. A LiveCD is
	also considered to be a target. Here is a complete list of all the targets that catalyst supports,
	as of 20031228:</p>

	<table>
	<tr><th>Target name</th><th>Description</th><th>Requirements to build (besides snapshot)</th></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>snapshot</c></ti><ti>Portage tree snapshot tarball</ti><ti>A valid Portage tree</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>stage1</c></ti><ti>A stage1 tarball (used for bootstrapping)</ti><ti>A "generic CPU" stage2 or stage3 tarball for your architecture (ie. <c>x86</c> rather than <c>pentium4</c>)</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>stage2</c></ti><ti>A stage2 tarball (used for <c>emerge system</c>)</ti><ti>An available stage1 tarball for your architecture</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>stage3</c></ti><ti>A stage3 tarball (complete Gentoo base system)</ti><ti>An available stage2 tarball with a sub-architecture that matches that of the target stage3 (ie. use a <c>pentium4</c> stage2 to build a <c>pentium4</c> stage3)</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>tinderbox</c></ti><ti>QA build engine -- for testing ebuilds</ti><ti>A stage3 tarball</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>livecd-stage1</c></ti><ti>First stage of LiveCD building</ti><ti>A stage3 tarball</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>livecd-stage2</c></ti><ti>Second stage of LiveCD building</ti><ti>A livecd-stage1 tarball</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>livecd-stage3</c> (not yet implemented)</ti><ti>A tarball that can be used to create LiveCD ISOs</ti><ti>A livecd-stage2 tarball</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>livecd-iso</c></ti><ti>A bootable, burnable LiveCD ISO</ti><ti>A livecd-stage3 tarball</ti></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Catalyst also supports a number of architectures. In catalyst-speak, an "architecture" is a
	general type of CPU platform. Here is a complete list of architectures supported by catalyst as
	of 20031228:</p>

	<table>
	<tr><th>Architecture</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>x86</c></ti><ti>Intel-compatible PC, ranging from i386 to Pentium 4 and Athlon XP</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>amd64</c></ti><ti>AMD's 64-bit platform, also known as "Opteron" or "x86-64"</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>alpha</c></ti><ti>The Alpha processor (all flavors)</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>hppa</c></ti><ti>HP's PA-RISC systems</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>ia64</c></ti><ti>Intel's Itanium 64-bit platform (Itanium Classic and Itanium 2)</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>ppc</c></ti><ti>Apple's PowerPC platform, including original PowerPC systems, G3, G4 and G5 in 32-bit mode</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>sparc</c></ti><ti>32-bit Sparc-based systems from Sun</ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>sparc64</c></ti><ti>64-bit UltraSparc-based systems</ti></tr>
	</table>

	<p>For each architecture, catalyst supports a number of "sub-architectures." A sub-architecture is a specific
	variant of the architecture. For example, <c>pentium4</c> is a sub-architecture of the <c>x86</c> architecture.
	Here is a list of all sub-architectures supported by catalyst as of 20031228:</p>

	<table>
	<tr><th>Architecture</th><th>Sub-architectures</th></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>x86</c></ti><ti><c>x86 i386 i486 i586 i686 pentium-mmx athlon athlon-xp athlon-mp pentium3 pentium4</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>amd64</c></ti><ti><c>amd64</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>alpha</c></ti><ti><c>alpha ev4 ev45 ev5 ev56 pca56 ev6 ev67</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>hppa</c></ti><ti><c>hppa</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>ia64</c></ti><ti><c>ia64</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>ppc</c></ti><ti><c>ppc power-ppc g3 g4</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>sparc</c></ti><ti><c>sparc</c></ti></tr>
	<tr><ti><c>sparc64</c></ti><ti><c>sparc64</c></ti></tr>
	</table>

	<p>You'll notice that all architectures have a sub-architecture with the same name as the architecture. This
	sub-architecture is meant to represent a "generic" build that should work on all systems in that architecture.
	Each sub-architecture has an associated set of <c>CFLAGS</c>, <c>CXXFLAGS</c>, as well as a <c>CHOST</c> and
	set of <c>USE</c> variables that are enabled on that sub-architecture. The <c>USE</c> settings are intended
	to enable any CPU-specific options, such as <c>mmx</c> or <c>altivec</c>.</p>

	<title>From stage1 to stage3</title>
	<body>
	<p>I will now guide you through the process of building your own stage1, stage2 and stage3 tarball,
	in that order.
	To begin, you'll first need to create a Portage tree snapshot as explained above. If you haven't
	done this already, type:</p>

<pre caption="Generating a snapshot with catalyst">
# catalyst target=snapshot version_stamp=20031102
</pre>
	<p>Next, you'll need to grab a "seed" stage2 or stage3 that will be used to build your new stage1.
	Stage1 tarballs are always built for a "generic" CPU sub-architecture, and should use a "generic"
	stage2 or stage3 as a "seed." For example, if you are building for the <c>x86</c> architecture,
	grab a stage2 or stage3 tarball built for the <c>x86</c> sub-architecture, not the <c>pentium4</c>
	subarchitecture. A stage2 or stage3 tarball for the <c>x86</c> sub-architecture will allow you
	to build a proper generic <c>x86</c> stage1.</p>

	<p>Stage2 and stage3 tarballs are available from our mirrors. They typically have the following
	naming format: <c>stage[X]-[subarch]-[version_stamp].tar.bz2</c>. Download a generic stage2 or
	stage3 for your architecture, and then place it in the proper location in <path>/var/tmp/catalyst</path>:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>"x86" stages should be placed in <path>/var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default-x86-1.4/</path></li>
	<li>"ppc" stages should be placed in <path>/var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default-ppc-1.4/</path></li>
	</ul>

	<p>If the target directory doesn't exist, create it first by typing <c>install -d [directoryname]</c>.</p>

	<p>The target directory path is determined as follows: <c>[storedir]/builds/[rel_type]-[mainarch]-[rel_version]</c>.
	The substring <c>[rel_type]-[mainarch]-[rel_version]</c> should expand to match the name of the profile (from <path>/usr/portage/profiles</path> you are
	going to use for building. <c>[mainarch]</c> is catalyst's keyword for the "architecture" of the build. Variable
	names that we haven't introduced yet, such as <c>[rel_type]</c> and <c>[rel_version]</c>, will be passed to <c>catalyst</c> as arguments in just a bit.</p>
