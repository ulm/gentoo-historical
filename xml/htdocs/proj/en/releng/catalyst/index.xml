<longdescription>
This project develops the catalyst tool, which is used to build official Gentoo
stage tarballs, packages and LiveCDs. This tool is designed to be easy to
use, customize, extend and maintain.
</longdescription>

<goals>
<p>The goal of the catalyst project is to provide a single multi-faceted tool that
can reliably build all aspects of a Gentoo Linux release: stage tarballs, GRP package
sets and LiveCDs.</p>

<p>Our specific development goals for <c>catalyst</c> include the following: ensuring it
provides high-quality builds of Gentoo Linux, and for the tool to be easy to use, customize,
extend and maintain. The catalyst tool is intended to be used by those who wish to
create their own customized versions of Gentoo Linux, or their own customized LiveCDs.
Our goal is to make catalyst a powerful tool that's a pleasure to use, and to ensure
that the code we write is maintainable and of high-quality.
