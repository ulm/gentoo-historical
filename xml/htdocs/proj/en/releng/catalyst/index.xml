<longname>Catalyst</longname>

<description>
This project develops the catalyst tool, which is used to build official
Gentoo stage tarballs, PackageCD and InstallCD and LiveCD images.
</description>

<longdescription>
The Gentoo catalyst project develops and supports the catalyst release building
tool. The design of catalyst is meant to be easy to use, cutomize, and
maintain. It is also used in other Gentoo projects, such as GNAP.
</longdescription>

<goals>
<p>
The goal of the catalyst project is to provide a single multi-faceted tool
that can reliably build all aspects of a Gentoo Linux release: stage tarballs,
GRP package sets, and install CDs.
</p>

<p>
Our specific development goals for <c>catalyst</c> include the following:
ensuring it provides high-quality builds of Gentoo Linux, and for the tool to
be easy to use, customize, extend and maintain. The catalyst tool is intended
to be used by those who wish to create their own customized versions of Gentoo
Linux, or their own customized LiveCDs. Our goal is to make catalyst a powerful
tool that's a pleasure to use, and to ensure that the code we write is
maintainable and of high-quality.
</p>

<p>
The catalyst <uri link="faq.xml">FAQ</uri> attempts to answer
commonly asked questions related to catalyst and its usage.
</p>

<p>
Catalyst has branched into two versions.  The current 1.x branch
will remain supported and will be used for bug-fix only until the
2.0 branch is stabilized.  No new features will be added to
catalyst 1.x after version 1.1.10.10. Catalyst 2.0 is the preferred branch
for anyone just starting with catalyst.
</p>

<p>
The catalyst Reference Manual is now available in two flavors, one
for catalyst <uri link="1.x/reference.xml">1.x</uri> and one for
catalyst <uri link="2.x/reference.xml">2.x</uri>.
</p>

<impo>
Currently the 2.x version of the reference manual is under construction, so it
is only partitally correct.  Please do not rely on it until this note is
no longer here.
</impo>

<p>
The Reference Manual is the definitive guide to
valid options for catalyst spec files and also for
<c>catalyst.conf</c>.
</p>

<impo>
The catalyst Reference Manual has not been updated in some time.
The best documentation for each catalyst option comes from
installing catalyst with <c>emerge catalyst</c> and looking through
the actual spec files used to build the last release, along with
the example templates.

<title>Supported Architectures</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Catalyst supports a number of architectures.  In catalyst-speak, an
"architecture" is a general type of CPU platform. Here is a
complete list of architectures supported by catalyst:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Architecture</th>

<ti>The Alpha processor (all flavors)</ti>

"x86-64".  This also includes Intel EM64T machines.</ti>

<ti><c>x86</c></ti>
<ti>Intel-compatible 32-bit CPU, ranging from i386 to Pentium 4 and
Athlon XP.</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
For each architecture, catalyst supports a number of
"sub-architectures."  A sub-architecture is a specific variant of
the architecture.  For example, <c>pentium4</c> is a
sub-architecture of the <c>x86</c> architecture.  Here is a list of
all sub-architectures supported by catalyst:
</p>

<ti><c>x86 i386 i486 i586 i686 pentium-mmx athlon athlon-xp

</tr>
</table>

<p>
You'll notice that all architectures have a sub-architecture with
the same name as the architecture.  This sub-architecture is meant
to represent a "generic" build that should work on all systems in
that architecture.Each sub-architecture has an associated set of
<c>CFLAGS</c>, <c>CXXFLAGS</c>, as well as a <c>CHOST</c> and set of
<c>USE</c> variables that are enabled on that sub-architecture.  The
<c>USE</c> settings are intended to enable any CPU-specific options,
such as <c>mmx</c> or <c>altivec</c>.
</p>

<note>
Catalyst currently also supports the ability to build
<c>x86</c> architecture stages on <c>amd64</c> systems.
