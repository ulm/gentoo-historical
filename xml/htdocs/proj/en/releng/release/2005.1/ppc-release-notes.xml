<chapter>
  <title>Important Changes for 2005.1</title>
  <section>
    <title>Security Updates</title>
    <body>
      <p>Gentoo Linux 2005.1 contains security updates to address GLSAs (Gentoo
        Linux Security Advisories) numbered 200503-18 to 200507-27.  </p>

      <p>Individual GLSAs can be referenced by going to
        <c>http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-$x.xml</c>, and
        substituting <c>$x</c> with the desired GLSA number. </p>

      <p>For more information, please consult the the <uri
          link="http://security.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux Security Project home
          page</uri>.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Profile Update</title>
    <body>
      <p>With Gentoo Linux 2005.1 the PowerPC team made a first step to merge
        the PowerPC 32-bit and PowerPC 64-bit development teams.  This merge
        leads also in using a common profile.  The 32-bit ppc profiles can be
        found in
        <path>/usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/ppc/2005.1/ppc</path>.  We
        support further sub-profiles for <path>G3</path>, <path>G4</path>,
        <path>G3/Pegasos</path> and <path>G4/Pegasos</path>.  Please update
        you profile as described in <uri
          link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-upgrading.xml" />.</p>

  <title>Upgrading and Installation of Gentoo Linux 2005.1</title>
  <section>
    <title>Installing Gentoo Linux 2005.1</title>
    <body>
      <p>The entire Gentoo Linux installation process is documented in the <uri
          link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml">Gentoo
          Handbook</uri>.</p>

      <p>Each architecture offers three LiveCDs. The first one being a universal
        bootable LiveCD which can be used to install with or without an Internet
        connection.  The second LiveCD is a non-bootable subarch-optimized
        Gentoo Reference Platform (GRP) LiveCD which contains precompiled
        binaries of popular programs such as X.org-x11, KDE, and GNOME. The
        third LiveCD is a bootable minimal LiveCD that is smaller in size and
        includes only the basics needed to simply boot a machine.</p>

      <p>At minimum, the universal or minimal LiveCD is required to boot the
        machine and install Gentoo.  The universal LiveCD requires an Internet
        connection to install from a stage1 installation tarball, but does not
        require an Internet connection to install from a stage3 installation
        tarball. The minimal LiveCD requires an Internet connection to install
        Gentoo Linux.</p>

      <p>There is one kernel available on both bootable cds. It will run on
        both, uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.  The kernel is based on
        linux-2.6.12 (gentoo-sources-2.6.12-r6).</p>

      <p>The LiveCDs are located on the mirrors as follows: </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>LiveCD Description</th>
          <th>Location on Mirrors</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Universal bootable LiveCD</ti>
          <ti>/releases/ppc/2005.1/ppc/installcd/install-ppc-universal-2005.0.iso</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Minimal bootable LiveCD</ti>
          <ti>/releases/ppc/2005.1/ppc/installcd/install-ppc-minimal-2005.0.iso</ti>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <ti>Non-bootable GRP-/Packages CD</ti>
          <ti>/releases/ppc/2005.1/ppc/packagecd/$subarch/packages-ppc-2005.0.iso</ti>
        </tr>

    <title>Upgrading to Gentoo Linux 2005.1</title>
    <body>
      <p> If you already have a working installation of Gentoo Linux (Version
        1.4, 2004.0 through 2005.0) there is no need to reinstall. You will
        automatically get Gentoo 2005.1 if you sync your Portage tree and run
        <c>emerge --update world</c>. If you still have an installation with a
        Gentoo 1.2 profile it might make sense -- in some cases -- that you do a
        new installation.</p>

      <p> There is also the possibility to update your system to a 1.4 profile
        from which you -- as already stated -- can easily get to Gentoo 2005.1.
        This update includes recompiling of glibc and some essential system
        packages; it will take a very long time (possibly longer as a complete
        re-installation) and it might also fail. So if you still have an
        installation with a Gentoo 1.2 profile, it's your decision whether you
        update or reinstall.</p>
