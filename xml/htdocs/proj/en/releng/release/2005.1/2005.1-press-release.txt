The Gentoo Foundation is pleased to announce the much anticipated release of
Gentoo Linux 2005.1 (Codename: El Nino). The ISO images for the release can be
found by visiting the Get Gentoo![1] page. Users may also download files from
an unofficial BitTorrent tracker[2] with full ISO images and stages. Much
thanks to Friends of Gentoo e.V.[3] for providing this tracker.
