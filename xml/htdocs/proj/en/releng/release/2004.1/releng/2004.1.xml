		<title>Main Goals</title>
		<body>
		<p>Compared to earlier releases, 2004.0 went very well, but it surely
		was not perfect. There were some key areas that could have been more
		efficient, such as infrastructure management, communication from releng
		regarding release guidelines, and a better understanding of what constitutes
		a release. 2004.1 is going to put a polish coat on our current product
		by addressing all of these issues. Although not
		publicly referred to as such, 2004.1 is going to be a maintenance release
		on 2004.0. The main goal for 2004.1 will be to fix all of the bugs
		that were encountered with 2004.0. All other goals are secondary. </p>
		
		<p>2004.1 will complete the following goals: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Clear and concise guidelines will be in place so that the
			release goes much more smoothly and enjoyably.</li>
			<li>A better use of infrastructure by revamping the current way releases
			are coordinated to be put on the mirrors.</li>
			<li>Catalyst enhancements and bugfixes.</li>
			<li>Better communication from releng to the arch release coordinators,
			and vice-a-versa.</li>
			<li>Internet based GRP for Portage's binary download and install functionality.</li>
			<li>Completion of all items on the
			<uri link="feature-request.xml">2004.1 Feature Request</uri> list.</li>
		</ul>
