		<title>Main Goals</title>
		<body>
		<p>Although 2004.0 went well for having so many "first times", there are surely
		areas which can be improved. 2004.1 is going to be a maintenance
		release on 2004.0 to address some of those areas. Although 2004.1 is not going
		to be called a maintenance release publically, internally it will
		be referred to as such. The main focus will be on the bugfixing, not
		adding technology to the release. The only technology that will be added
		is the stacked profile system. </p>

		<p>2004.1 will complete the following goals: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Clear and concise guidelines will be in place so that the
			release goes much more smoothly and enjoyably.</li>
			<li>A better use of infrastructure by revamping the current way releases
			are coordinated to be put on the mirrors.</li>
			<li>Stackable profile integration.</li>
			<li>Catalyst enhancements and bugfixes.</li>
			<li>Better communication from releng to the arch release coordinators,
			and vice-a-versa.</li>
			<li>Internet based GRP for Portage's binary download and install functionality.</li>
			<li>Any other bugfixes in the release components that did not make it
			for 2004.0.</li>
		</ul>
