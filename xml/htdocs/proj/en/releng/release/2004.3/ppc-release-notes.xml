	<title>Upgrading and Installation of Gentoo Linux 2004.3</title>
	<section>
		<title>Installing Gentoo Linux 2004.3</title>
		<body>
			<p>The entire Gentoo Linux installation process is documented 
			in the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>. </p>
			
			<p>Each architecture offers three LiveCDs. The first one being a universal
			bootable LiveCD which can be used to install with or without an Internet connection.
			The second LiveCD is a non-bootable subarch-optimized Gentoo Reference Platform (GRP)
			LiveCD which contains precompiled binaries of popular
			programs such as X.org-x11, KDE, and GNOME. The third LiveCD is a bootable minimal LiveCD
			that is smaller in size and includes only the basics needed to simply boot a machine.</p>
			
			<p>At minimum, the universal or minimal LiveCD is required to boot the machine and install Gentoo.
			The universal LiveCD requires an Internet connection to install from a stage1
			installation tarball, but does not require an Internet connection to install
			from a stage3 installation tarball. The minimal LiveCD requires an Internet connection
			to install Gentoo Linux.</p>

			<p>The Universal PPC 2004.3 livecd has a Darwin / MacOS X cross compiler on board. The minimal cd
			is not equipped with this feature. A gcc-3.4.1 linux compiler is also available on the bigger cd. 
			Distcc is enabled by default.</p>

			<p>Full Pegasos support out of the box. Thanks to Freescale Semiconductor and Genesi for donating
			Open Desktop Workstations. It is no longer required to pass arguments to the Pegasos kernel, 
			the default arguments are compiled into the kernel.</p>

			<p>Just like 2004.2/PPC , this release features a squashfs2 compressed livecd loop filesystem. An
			X-enabled live DVD/CD with automatic boottime X.org configuration will be available after the 
			2004.3 release in the /experimental directory on the mirrors and torrents.gentoo.org</p>

			<p>Livecd kernels are 2.6.9 based. ImacG5 support still experimental because of issues with cdrom
			and thermal management (fans at 100%). The ImacG5 boots to a static shell initrd prompt. The 
			pending experimental X-enabled live DVD and CD will support this machine completely.</p>

			<p>Because of size constraints, there are only 604, G3, G4, G5 and Pegasos compatible kernels on the cd. An experimental livecd for more exotic prep and chrp machines will be available in 
			the near future. Testers needed (gentoo-ppc-dev@gentoo.org)</p>

			<p>Cascading 2004.3 profile as the default profile and udev as default dev-manager. Completely 
			revamped toolchain (gcc-3.4.1, glibc 2.3.4 based). The entire ppc portage tree has been tested 
			and prepared for NPTL, linux26-headers compatibility. NPTL is not enabled by default however, 
			add NPTL to your use flags for an NPTL enabled PPC toolchain. Please note that a 2.4 kernel 
			can not boot a userland with an NPTL enabled toolchain.</p>

			<p>Bootsplash can be used on ppc. Not enabled by default on the livecd (yet). emerge bootsplash</p>

			<p>A lot of work was performed on oldworld support, feedback welcome on bugs.gentoo.org.</p>

			<p>The LiveCDs are located on the mirrors as follows: </p>

		<title>Upgrading to Gentoo Linux 2004.3</title>
		<body>
			<p>
			If you already have a working installation of Gentoo Linux (Version
			1.4, 2004.0, 2004.1) there is no need to reinstall. You will automatically get
			Gentoo 2004.3 if you sync your Portage tree and run
			<c>emerge --update world</c>. If you still have an installation
			with a Gentoo 1.2 profile it might make sense -- in some cases -- 
			that you do a new installation.</p>
			<p>
			There is also the possibility to update your system to a 1.4 
			profile from which you -- as already stated -- can easily get to
			Gentoo 2004.3. This update includes recompiling of glibc and some
			essential system packages; it will take a very long time (possibly
			longer as a complete re-installation) and it might also fail. So if
			you still have an installation with a Gentoo 1.2 profile, it's
			your decision whether you update or reinstall.
