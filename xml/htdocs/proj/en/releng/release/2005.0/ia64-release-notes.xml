		<p>
			For this release, the Itanium architecture now utilizes 2.6 kernel headers for better interoperability
			with 2.6 kernels as well as a newer 2.3.4 stable glibc branch. The GCC toolchain has not been
			changed due to known issues in newer versions and remains at 3.3.2.

		<body>
			<p>
			No LiveCDs are available at this moment, so the only supported installation method is to either boot
			a <uri link="http://www.debian.org">Debian</uri> IA/64 CD or to use an existing Linux installation to
			install.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once you have booted Linux, whether from a CD or an existing installation, you should fetch the stages
			and chroot as normal. It is <b>important</b> that you keep in mind the following considerations to
			achieve a bootable installation:

			<p>
			If you already have a working installation of Gentoo Linux (Version
			2004.3) there is no need to reinstall. You will automatically get
			Gentoo 2005.0 if you sync your Portage tree and run
			<c>emerge --update world</c>.

			<ul>
				<li>
				Use only GNU parted to create your partitions. Other
				applications such as fdisk or cfdisk do not support EFI GPT
				partition tables, so your partitions will be lost on reboot.
				</li>
				<li>
				Your system disk must have /boot as the first partition and
				/ as the secondary partition. Any free space on your system
				disk may be partitioned in any sequence as can any disks which
				are not intended to hold the system.
				</li>
				<li>
				You must use ELILO as your bootloader. Other bootloaders do not
				support IA-64.
				</li>
				<li>
				You should use a 2.6 kernel; 2.4 kernels have known issues and
				are thus not supported by us.
