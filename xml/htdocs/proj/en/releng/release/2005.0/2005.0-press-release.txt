Gentoo Linux is proud to bring you the long awaited Gentoo Linux 2005.0
release!

This release has had a few setbacks including a complete security
rebuild, but with the help of the many teams within the Gentoo developer
community, we believe that this release will be one of the best that we
have ever had.

This release includes new installation media from Alpha, AMD64, PPC,
PPC64, SPARC, and x86 and includes stages for IA64 and SPARC32. Please
check out our mirrors [1] to find the closest one to you.

As with 2004.3, you will be able to download optimized PackageCD images
for x86 and PPC via our bittorrent [2] server, and also our "unofficial"
secondary bittorrent [3] server, provided by Friends of Gentoo e.V. in
Germany.
