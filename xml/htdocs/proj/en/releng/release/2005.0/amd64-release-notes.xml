	<title>Upgrading and Installation of Gentoo Linux 2005.0</title>

		<title>Installing Gentoo Linux 2005.0</title>
		<body>
			<p>The entire Gentoo Linux installation process is documented 
			in the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml">Gentoo Handbook</uri>. </p>
			
			<p>Each architecture offers three LiveCDs. The first one being a universal
			bootable LiveCD which can be used to install with or without an Internet connection.
			The second LiveCD is a non-bootable subarch-optimized Gentoo Reference Platform (GRP)
			LiveCD which contains precompiled binaries of popular
			programs such as X.org-x11, KDE, and GNOME. The third LiveCD is a bootable minimal LiveCD
			that is smaller in size and includes only the basics needed to simply boot a machine.</p>
			
			<p>At minimum, the universal or minimal LiveCD is required to boot the machine and install Gentoo.
			The universal LiveCD requires an Internet connection to install from a stage1
			installation tarball, but does not require an Internet connection to install
			from a stage3 installation tarball. The minimal LiveCD requires an Internet connection
			to install Gentoo Linux.</p>

			<p>There is one kernel available on both bootable cds. It will run on both, uniprocessor and smp systems.
			The kernel is based on linux-2.6.11 (gentoo-sources-2.6.11-r3). The alternative kernel, <c>gentoo-em64t</c>, 
			is compiled without AMD K8 optimization and without NUMA support, but with SMP support. Press "F1" at the boot prompt to choose which kernel to boot into.</p>

			<p>The LiveCDs are located on the mirrors as follows: </p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>LiveCD Description</th>
					<th>Location on Mirrors</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<ti>Universal bootable LiveCD</ti>
					<ti>/releases/amd64/2005.0/installcd/install-amd64-universal-2005.0.iso</ti>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<ti>Minimal bootable LiveCD</ti>
					<ti>/releases/amd64/2005.0/installcd/install-amd64-minimal-2005.0.iso</ti>

		<title>Upgrading to Gentoo Linux 2005.0</title>
		<body>
			<p>
			If you already have a working installation of Gentoo Linux (Version
			1.4, 2004.0, 2004.1) there is no need to reinstall. You will automatically get
			Gentoo 2005.0 if you sync your Portage tree and run
			<c>emerge --update world</c>. If you still have an installation
			with a Gentoo 1.2 profile it might make sense -- in some cases -- 
			that you do a new installation.</p>
			<p>
			There is also the possibility to update your system to a 1.4 
			profile from which you -- as already stated -- can easily get to
			Gentoo 2005.0. This update includes recompiling of glibc and some
			essential system packages; it will take a very long time (possibly
			longer as a complete re-installation) and it might also fail. So if
			you still have an installation with a Gentoo 1.2 profile, it's
			your decision whether you update or reinstall.
