For immediate publication:

Gentoo Linux is proud to announce the release of Gentoo Linux 2004.0
for the x86, AMD64, PowerPC, Sun SPARC, and SGI MIPS architectures.
Additionally, the Gentoo Hardened team is announcing the inaugural release
of a security-enhanced Gentoo platform for the x86 architecture.

In addition to many bugfixes and security updates since the 1.4 release,
Gentoo Linux 2004.0 contains a cutting-edge development toolchain and user
environment including, but not limited to, Linux kernel 2.6.3, GCC 3.3.2,
GLIBC 2.3.2, KDE 3.2, GNOME 2.4.2, and xfce4.

We are pleased to announce the new Gentoo Store [1].  Available
at the Gentoo Store are Gentoo Linux LiveCDs that come complete
with the on-CD Gentoo Installation Handbook, 2004.0 Release Notes [2]
and optimized pre-compiled binary packages. Users who want to 
stay up-to-date for 2004 can purchase a subscription
that offers the shipment of each quarterly 2004.x release sent straight to their door.
Those wishing to donate to Gentoo Linux can now do so in an easy and secure manner
utilizing the new donation system. The Gentoo Store accepts PayPal, Visa,
Mastercard, and Discover for both orders and donations.

Gentoo Linux 2004.0 marks the debut of Catalyst, the new Gentoo release meta-tool. Using
Catalyst, developers and users can create and customize every aspect of
their Gentoo Linux system; from installation stages, to bootable LiveCDs, to
customized binary packages for the Gentoo Reference Platform (GRP). For more
information on Catalyst, please see the Catalyst project page and online
documentation [3].

Installation stages, LiveCDs, and GRP sets can be
found on our mirrors [4]. More information about the Gentoo Hardened project
can be found on its project page [5]. For more information, please consult
