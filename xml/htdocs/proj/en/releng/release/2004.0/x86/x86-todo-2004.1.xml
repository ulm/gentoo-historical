		<ul>
			<li>
				the do*-Boot-parameters need to be fixed. This has to be done in Genkernel
			</li>
			<li>
				Instead of merging 3rd-Party-modules onto the fs of the CD, they should be moved
				into the initrd.
			</li>
			<li>
				catalyst needs to set a timezone before compiling kernels - otherwise <e>uname -v</e> won't work
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>communication between releng and doc</b> : My suggestion would be (well, that's what I will do ;) ) to
				send quick reports to Swift to guarantee that handbook and release fit together.
			</li>
			<li>
				mdadm needs to be put onto the livecd
			</li>
			<li>
				3com-574 NICs should be supported by the kernels on the CD
			</li>
