<title>Release verification</title>

<section>
<title>Integrity checking</title>
<body>

<p>
There will be DIGESTS files for all release media on the Gentoo mirrors. This
file can be used to verify that the media that was downloaded was not corrupted
in transit.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Source verification</title>
<body>

<p>
All release media will have its DIGESTS file signed by the <c>Gentoo Linux
Release	Engineering (releng@gentoo.org)</c> PGP key. The public key ID is
<c>0x17072058</c>, and the key is available through the <c>subkeys.pgp.net</c>
keyserver. This can be used to verify that the media is, in fact, the media
shipped by Release Engineering and not from a potential attacker.
