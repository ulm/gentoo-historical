		<title>Installing Gentoo Linux 2006.0</title>
		<body>
			<p>
			Once you have booted Linux, whether from a InstallCD or an existing installation, you should fetch the stages
			and chroot as normal. It is <b>important</b> that you keep in mind the following considerations to
			achieve a bootable installation:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Use only GNU parted to create your partitions. Other
				applications such as fdisk or cfdisk do not support EFI GPT
				partition tables, so your partitions will be lost on reboot.
				</li>
				<li>
				You must use ELILO as your bootloader. Other bootloaders do not
				support IA-64.
				</li>
				<li>
				You should use a 2.6 kernel; 2.4 kernels have known issues and
				are thus not supported by us.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<body>
			<p>
			If you already have a working installation of Gentoo Linux there is no need to reinstall. You will automatically get
			Gentoo 2006.0 if you sync your Portage tree and run <c>emerge --update world</c>.
