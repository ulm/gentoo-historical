<title>Goals</title>

<section>
<body>

<p>
The primary goal of 2006.1 is to improve the quality of the Gentoo release
media by including more drivers. We are also looking to improve the quality of
the build over the last release, which is a recurring goal with every release.
</p>

<p>
The secondary goal of this release is to build experimental LiveCD images for
at least one architecture other than AMD64/x86 to facilitate Gentoo Linux
Installer testing.
