  <title>Test benches</title>
  <section>
    <body>
      <p>
        We need to collate, and create when necessary, test benches for each
        package. The goal is to provide arch testers and users with a way of
        checking that an application is properly working.
      </p>
      <p>
        These test benches can be anything from a set of written instructions
        to an automated script. They should be as simple as possible. A
        non-specialist must be able to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's not forget they must be maintained to work with the new versions
        of the packages.

<title>Package maintenance</title>

<section>
  <title>sci-electronics/*</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Stabilize latest versions whenever possible, and get rid of the others.
      Portage should be kept as lean as possible.
    </p>

<section>
  <title>sci-electronics/electric</title>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stabilize version 8.11. Version 9.00 is available on the tree as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        See if building versions 8 and later from sources is a good idea (it's
        java). Current decision is no, but that may change.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>

<section>
  <title>sci-electronics/geda</title>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stabilize version 1.6.2
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</section>

<section>
  <title>sci-electronics/geda-suite</title>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write a newer ebuild (than version 20050820) with updated dependencies.
      </li>
      <li> Done! See version 20110427. Please test and give feedback. TomJBE</li>
    </ul>

<section>
  <title>sci-electronics/kicad</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      Denis and Rafael should provide and document the ugly script they use to
      generate the custom tarballs.
    </p>
  </body>
</section>

<section>
  <title>sci-electronics/ngspice</title>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>
	  Investigate the use of boehm-gc. Heavy simulations can make use of 
	  better memory management.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <title>Open bugs</title>
  <section>
    <body>
      <p>
        Although the packages are in good shape, we should keep the bug list as
	minimal as possible.
