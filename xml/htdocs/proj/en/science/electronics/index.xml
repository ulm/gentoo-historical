    <description>Write test benches for all our software</description>
    <longdescription>
      <p>
      The kind of applications we're dealing with makes it difficult or even
      impossible for a non-specialist to test them. Thus we need to write test
      benches in order to verify they work properly. This is essential for arch
      testers to be able to stabilize them, but should also help keywording on
      less common architectures.

      <p>
      A number of devs contribute to the Electronics Subproject, but are not
      members of it. It would be good to have them officialy join us. In order
      not to scare them, it should be made clear that their responsibility would
      be limited to the packages they accept to maintain. This would increase
      cohesion, communication, and make our collective work more effective. At
      the same time we should look for herd testers and expert users to assist
      us in our work.
