Gentoo Miniconf 2012, Prague CZ: Bootstrapping Awesome!
</description>

<longdescription>

<impo>Some of the content was taken from the <uri
link="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/05/23/opensuse-conference-has-a-location-and-a-cfp-out/">
openSUSE announcement</uri>, with the permission of the original author, Jos Poortvliet
</impo>

<p>
Gentoo Miniconf 2012 (the first ever!) will be held in Prague, the beautiful
capital of the Czech Republic, during the weekend from October 20 to October
21. The Miniconf will be joined by no less than three other events! The local
<uri link="http://www.linuxdays.cz/">LinuxDays</uri>, a newly created event
to replace the largest Czech Free Software event, the 4th annual <uri
link="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference</uri> and the 14th
SUSE Labs conference. Having so many projects and people in one place, an
environment full of fun and creativity, a place where ideas become reality
and new friends are made, will be created! You can check out  all the other
co-hosted events from our <uri link="http://bootstrapping-awesome.org">common
landing page</uri> and make some new friends ;-)
</p>

<p>
The Miniconf conference will take place at the <uri
link="http://www.linuxdays.cz/venue">Czech Technical University</uri>, which runs
Gentoo on all its servers and desktop machines! For more information about the
venue, check the website of LinuxDays conference. Hope to see you all in Prague 
in October!!
</p>

<p>
The theme of the conference is Bootstrapping Awesome! It has a special meaning
for each of the four conferences that are going to be co-hosted. It's the
first time that the openSUSE conference will be held in another city (previous
ones have all been held in Nurnberg), but it also means the 'bootstrapping' for
our Gentoo Miniconf and the LinuxDays Conference!

<title>Type of proposals we are looking for</title>
<body>

<p>
The Miniconf is a perfect opportunity to hack together. Thus, we will try to
lean on technical topics mostly, and workshops about packaging, ebuild hacking
or other Gentoo related projects. Of course non-technical topics are welcome as
well. So if you’re unsure if your idea fits our conference, let us decide that
for you – just send it in!
</p>

<section>
<title>Collaboration</title>
<body>

<p>
Each conference will have their own Call for Papers. However, the CfP teams will
collaborate to ensure there is no overlap and that sessions relevant for multiple
audiences are planned in the right spot. It is therefor appreciated if you properly
select if your proposal also has relevance for the other communities; and what
level (beginner-intermediate-expert) it has; and what languages you’d prefer to give
the session in.

<p>
You can and you should register for attending the Gentoo Miniconf  and other conferences.
Although registration is optional, it will help us estimate number of people coming and
will get you some benefits as well. There is only one registration for all conferences
and you can register for free but there are also other registration options that will
let you support conferences financially.
</p>

<p>
Why register? Even with free registration you’ll get a badge with your name and bag full
of swag. Among other things, bag will contain plush openSUSE chameleon called Geeko.
</p>

<p>
Next option is is supporters registration which costs €40. In comparison to free
registration, you will get on top of everything unique gift (details of this gifts
are highly classified and meant as a surprise) and opportunity to attend VIP dinner
at Sunday evening with speakers and organizers.
</p>

<p>
Last option is registration as professional. Professionals will get on top of everything
previously mentioned opportunity to attend feedback session with SUSE executive management
team.
</p>

<p>
For those who will ask (independent of type of registration), organizers will try to
provide possibility to buy a lunch nearby. So if you don’t want to be hungry during
the conference, you can do something about it
