Gentoo Miniconf 2012, Prague CZ: Bootstrapping Awesome
</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
Gentoo Miniconf 2012 (the first ever!) will be held in Prague, the beautiful
capital of the Czech Republic, during the weekend from October 20 to October
21. The Miniconf will be joined by no less than three other events! The local
<uri link="http://www.linuxdays.cz/">LinuxDays</uri>, a newly created event
to replace the largest Czech Free Software event, the 4th annual <uri
link="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference</uri> and the 14th
SUSE Labs conference. Having so many projects and people in one place, an
environment full of fun and creativity, a place where ideas become reality
and new friends are made, will be created! You can check out  all the other
co-hosted events from our <uri link="http://bootstrapping-awesome.org">common
landing page</uri> and make some new friends ;-)
</p>

<p>
The Miniconf conference will take place at the <uri
link="http://www.linuxdays.cz/">Czech Technical University</uri>, which runs
Gentoo on all its servers and desktop machines! For more information about the
venue, check the website of LinuxDays conference. Be aware that Call for Papers
will start really soon. Hope to see you all in Prague in October!!
