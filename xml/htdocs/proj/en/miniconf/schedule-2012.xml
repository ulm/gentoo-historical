        <ti align="center">Gentoo has gone through a lot of changes since its start in 1999.  One
            of the changes that really affected the core working of Gentoo, was the
            departure of its founder, Daniel Robbins.  From this situation without a
            clear leader several entities within the project had to be setup to
            replace Daniel's duties. In this talk Fabian and Robin will present the roles of the
            Council and Trustees of Gentoo, and how they manage Gentoo as a whole.</ti>

            repetitive and manual tasks which could really gain in being batch
            automated with proper pre-configuration. A a first prototype of a project to automate various Gentoo based scripts,
            such as package stabilization and architecture testing, using a
            minimal virtualized tinderbox and volunteer computing will be presented.</ti>

            constant: KDE gets better and better! So, let Tomáš show you how they

            a stable version, newest releases or, for those brave or insane
            enough, even an option to always install the current Git head,
            and surf along the bleeding edge of technology.</ti>

            project, which he is still maintaining. This is a benchmarking suite
            that is capable of comparing the performance and accuracy of
            numerical libraries, even if it is modular enough to potentially
            support every type of benchmark.
            This suite makes use of the main Gentoo features -- in particular
            Portage -- and during his talk he will present some of the advantages
            of the Gentoo infrastructure  in the field of numerical computing
            (but not only) related to the ability of fine-tuning and compiling
            every software present in the Portage tree and overlays.</ti>

            for stages and ISOs. The talk will focus on 2 or 3 specific examples
            that can be used as the basis for users to create their own custom
            releases and present a configuration for catalyst to create.

            Note: The catalyst run takes sometime, so for users to be able to run
            some tests, they must have a speedy box and allocate a few hours / a
            day for the building. Instructions will be provided in advance for
            users to configure theirs systems before the talk starts.</ti>

        <ti align="center">"Gentoo Prefix allows to install many software packages on systems ""foreign"" to Gentoo, such as Solaris, Mac OS X and other Linux distributions. It does so by simply installing all software in a file-system offset, any directory chosen by the user. Being in any location brings a second virtue of Gentoo Prefix: administrative privileges are *not* required. In this workshop, Fabian will start with a brief talk about the Gentoo Prefix project, from its history up to the current state of affairs. The rest of the workshop is interactive based on questions and answering. Brave participants are encouraged to get their hands dirty by trying to install a Gentoo Prefix on their systems.</ti>

        <ti>There will be a keysigning event at the miniconf. It will happen on Sunday at 13:30. It will be held at the Gentoo room, unless the number of participants is too high. In this case we will move to the main hall or even out in the street.<br />
            There is no central key registry for this keysigning. Instead it will simply be a keyslip exchange.<br />
            What to bring:
            <ul>
                <li>Yourself</li>
                <li>Paper slips with your key id, fingerprint, name &amp; emails.</li>
                <li>Something to identify yourself. Usually government-issued identification, such as a passport. Multiple pieces of identification are preferred.</li>
                <li>If you need to make new paper slips, this generator tool is suggested: http://openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html</li>
            </ul>
            At this time, there are 50+ attendees expected at the keysigning event, so you should bring at least that number of slips. Doubling that may be advisable if the event ends up being very large.</ti>

             In this workshop attendees will get to know its declarative language, and

             setting up a server-client environment, and test it on multiple virtual
             machines running different linux distros. The overall goal is to show all the
             advantages on running puppet from a single laptop to a large datacenter.
             Attendants are requested to have the puppet package installed in their

Further goals would be to increase the interest in this area and try to get enough people involved to work on a design specification and later implementation.</ti>

        <ti align="center">Fabian has been a Gentoo developer since 2005.  His Linux adventures had
            started several years before joining Gentoo.  After using Gentoo Linux
            for 4 years, he decided to get his first Mac in a useful state for
            development when he became a developer in the Gentoo/Alt team for the
            Gentoo for Mac OS X project.  Ever since, he has worked on the successor
            of this project, what is today the successful Gentoo Prefix project.  As
            database computer scientist, he can combine the Gentoo Prefix project
            with his work to empower most of the buildfarm machines running all
            kinds of UNIX.  Currently, Fabian serves his second term on the Gentoo
        Council, a leading management body of the Gentoo project.</ti>

        <ti align="center">Robin H. Johnson (robbat2) has been a Gentoo developer for nearly 10
            years. Originally drafted because he was submitting too many patches &amp;
            ebuilds and the existing devs got tired of applying all of them. Robin
            joined multiple teams as as other developers had left, previously
            leading the PHP &amp; MySQL teams before recruiting other developers to work
            them. This later lead Robin to join the council (2006-2007 term),
            Foundation (2009-present) &amp; infrastructure (2003-present): Things were
            broken, and fixing them to scratch his own itch was the quickest way to
            make progress. He's committed to more than 25% of the tree, and
        maintains more than 2% of the tree.</ti>
