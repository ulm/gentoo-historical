<description>
	The Gentoo Virtualization Project maintains packages shared between the
	different virtualization (sub-)projects and provides documentation and
	tools to the user to make Gentoo a first choice platform as both host
	and guest system.
</description>

<longdescription>
	<p>
	With the various virtualization solutions are also tools available to
	manage more than one kind of virtual machine.  Furthermore it is
	possible to share certain knowledge on how to setup and administer
	such systems. This project exists as a general virtualization project
	to maintain common packages, to collect documentation and to give the
	user a general overview what's available on all Gentoo platforms.
	</p>

	<p>
	This includes (combination of) the following techniques:
	KVM, Qemu, Lguest, Xen, VMWare, VirtualBox, vServer, OpenVZ,
	Linux Containers, Solaris Zones, FreeBSD Jails
	</p>
</longdescription>

<goals>
	<p>
	The current goal is to bring all stakeholders together and to define
	the next steps.  Furthermore, mailinglist, irc-channel, mail-alias 
	have to be created.  Shortly after defining how the different 
	sub-projects should interact, a public announcement has to be made.
