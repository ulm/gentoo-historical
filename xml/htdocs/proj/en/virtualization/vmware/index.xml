    <summary>Team Member/Team Lead</summary>
    <details>
      A team member or the team lead is needed to package up the closed-source
      vmware packages (currently workstation, player and server) for installation
      on a Gentoo system.  The greatest part of this task is ensuring that the
      appropriate kernel modules compile with the latest kernel whilst still maintaining
      backwards compatibility with previous kernels.
    </details>
    <requirements>
      Enthusiasm for challenging positions, knowledge of kernel modules and ability
      to work with and around closed-source software.  Experience with ebuilds and eclasses
      is vital.  Also, the current installer requires a good working knowledge of python
      and standard unix tools (patch, etc).  The legacy installer requires a good working 
      knowledge of perl.
