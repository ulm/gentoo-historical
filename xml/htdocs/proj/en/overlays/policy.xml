<title>Introduction</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Here are the policies for the overlays.g.o service.  If you host an overlay on
overlays.g.o, or if you participate in the administration of overlays.g.o, you
must follow these policies.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>What Is The Overlays.g.o Service?</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
overlays.g.o provides a social workspace, for Gentoo projects and developers
to publish their Gentoo package overlays in one location, where it's easy for
devs and non-devs alike to collaborate.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Types Of Overlay</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
overlays.g.o hosts two types of overlay:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>overlays for Gentoo project teams</li>
  <li>overlays for individual Gentoo developers</li>
</ul>
<p>
overlays.g.o does *not* host overlays owned by any other individuals at this
time.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Project Overlays</title>
<body>
<p>
"Project overlays" are overlays owned by recognised Gentoo project teams.
Such teams are required to meet the definition of a project that you can find
in our metastructure document.
</p>
<p>
"Project overlays" will have the same name as the Gentoo project team.  Each
project is only allowed a single overlay.
</p>
<p>
As far as this policy is concerned, project overlays are owned by the elected
lead(s) of the project.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Developer Overlays</title>
<body>
<p>
"Developer overlays" are overlays owned by individual Gentoo developers.
These are the developers who have successfully taken the Gentoo developer
quizzes, and who have been given commit access to the main Gentoo package
tree.
</p>
<p>
Each "developer overlay" will have the same name as the developer who owns
the overlay.  Each developer is only allowed a single overlay. 
</p>
<p>
As far as this policy is concerned, developer overlays are owned by the
individual Gentoo developer who asked for the overlay to be hosted.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Responsibilities</title>
<section>
<body>
<ol>
  <li>Infra are responsible for the platform (hardware + o/s) that overlays.g.o is hosted on.</li>
  <li>The overlays project team is responsible for administering the overlays.g.o service, including responsibility for the software used to deliver the service (e.g. svn, trac).</li>
  <li>Overlay owners are responsible for the contents of their overlays, and for the conduct of anyone who has commit access to their overlays.</li>
  <li>Any individual committing to an overlay is responsible for his/her own actions.</li>
</ol>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Creating Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Overlays are created at the request of whoever will be the owner of the
overlay.
</p>
<p>Overlays are optional; no Gentoo developer or project team is required to setup an overlay.
</p>
<p>
Gentoo developers are free to host their overlays somewhere else.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Commit Access To Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
To be clear:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A "developer" is someone who has commit access to the main Gentoo package tree.</li>
  <li>A non-developer is anyone who doesn't have commit access to the main Gentoo package tree.  That includes other members of Gentoo staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Project overlays:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any developer listed on a team's project page can have commit access to that team's overlay(s).  Just ask the overlays admin team to sort you out with access.</li>
  <li>Any dev not listed on a team's project page can have commit access, with the agreement of a member of the project team.</li>
  <li>Any non-dev can have commit access to a team's overlay(s).  The request for access has to come from the owner of the overlay.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Developer overlays:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any Gentoo dev can ask for commit access, with the agreement of the overlay's owner.</li>
  <li>Any non-dev can have commit access to a developer's overlay.  The request for access has to come from the owner of the overlay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Requirements For Non-Devs</p>
<ul>
  <li>The non-dev is required to have registered their nick on Freenode IRC first, and must provide a valid email address for our records.</li>
  <li>If you're a non-dev, please don't ask the overlays team directly for access, as refusal often offends.</li>
</ul>
<note>
With trac + svn, it's possible to give commit access separately to trac (ie, the wiki), and svn.
</note>
</body>

<chapter>
<title>General Rules For Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
We're deliberately trying to keep the rules on overlays to a minimum.  Please,
don't abuse the service, and force us to add more rules :(
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>What You Can And Cannot Store On overlays.g.o</title>
<body>
<p>
overlays.g.o is for hosting package trees, their patchsets, any docs, and any downloadable tarballs that have nowhere else to be hosted.  
</p>
<p>
It's not to be $UPSTREAM for a package (unless it's a small utility like an eselect module or equivalent, required to support the packages in the overlay).  If you need $UPSTREAM hosting, look at somewhere like SourceForge, Berlios.de, or Gentoo Experimental.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Overlays Are Public</title>
<body>
<p>
There are no "secret" overlays.
</p>
<p>
All overlays are listed on the frontpage of overlays.g.o, and anyone is free to download the contents of an overlay.
</p>
<p>
If you need a secret overlay, we're not the service for you.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Bug Tracking</title>
<body>
<p>
bugs.g.o is the OneTrueBugTrackingSystem(tm), even for overlays.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Moving Contributions From Overlays To The Portage Tree</title>
<body>
<p>
Don't set up anything to automatically commit the contents of an overlay to the main Gentoo package tree.  Ever.
</p>
<p>
Any code you take from an overlay and commit to the main Gentoo package tree needs to be thoroughly reviewed first.  As the person committing the code to the main tree, it's <e>your</e> responsibility to ensure that the code meets the required standards.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Administration Of Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Only the overlays.g.o administration team (listed on the overlays project
page) have shell access into the overlays.g.o box.  At the moment, account
management (including resetting passwords) has to be done through the overlays
administration team.
</p>
<p>
If you need anything doing to your overlay (adding/removing a user f.ex),
please ask in #gentoo-overlays, and someone will help you as soon as possible.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Removal Of Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Overlays can be removed at the discretion of the overlays administration team.
Except for exceptional circumstances, we'll only remove overlays for the
following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Project overlays will be removed if the project closes down.</li>
<li>Developer overlays will be removed when its owner retires.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Exceptional circumstances may include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Complaints from other developers about the contents of an overlay causing problems for packages in the main tree.</li>
<li>Complaints from other developers about the contents of an overlay creating a security risk to our users.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All exceptional circumstances will be discussed on gentoo-dev before action is
taken.
</p>
<impo>
Overlays are places where experimental changes can be made and tested.  Please make sure you understand why things are the way they are in an overlay before you make a complaint about what's going on!
</impo>

<chapter>
<title>Restrictions On New Software</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
We're always willing to listen to requests for different software we could
offer as part of the service.  Please bear in mind that we need to keep the
amount of software offered to a minimum, to reduce the workload on the overlays
administration team.
</p>
<p>
Any new software added to the service will have to meet the following 
requirements *as a minimum*.  Please don't ask for a piece of software unless 
you've checked and made sure it meets these requirements.
</p>

<ul>
<li>There must be a working package for the software in Portage.</li>
<li>The package must have an active maintainer.</li>
<li>The package must have a "credible" security history.  In particular, packages that need regular updating to fix security holes are likely to be rejected.</li>
<li>If the package provides a bug-tracking system, it must be possible to disable the bug-tracking system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The only access to overlays.g.o is via these two mechanisms:
</p>
<ol>
<li>HTTP/HTTPS and Apache, and</li>
<li>rsync from dev.gentoo.org (coming in Phase 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>
The security mechanism for overlays.g.o is via HTTP basic auth, over SSL.  We use both htpasswd and htgroup files to manage who can commit where.
</p>
<p>A package can have finer-grained control via its own security mechanisms (e.g. trac's permissions list), but the package must be compatible with these access and security restrictions.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Errors And Omissions</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
If you find a fault with this policy, please file a bug on bugs.g.o, and
assign it to overlays@gentoo.org.
</p>

<p>
All policy changes will first be posted to gentoo-dev for discussion.
