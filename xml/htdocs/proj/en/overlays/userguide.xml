<p>This document has been written for all users of Gentoo.  If you are a Gentoo
developer or Gentoo staff member, and you want to be able to manage your own
overlay, please see the <uri link="/proj/en/overlays/devguide.xml">Developers' Guide</uri>.</p>

<title>What Are Overlays?</title>
<body>
<p>"Overlays" are package trees for Portage.  They contain additional ebuilds for Gentoo.  They are maintained by Gentoo developers, but are distributed separately from the main Portage tree.</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Why Use Overlays?</title>
<body>
<p>People create overlays for all sorts of reasons.  Here are a few of the main
ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you modify an ebuild in /usr/portage, your change will be lost the next time you emerge --sync.  But, if you put your modified ebuild into an overlay, your change is safe from emerge --sync.</li>
<li>Because overlays are not the main Gentoo Portage package tree, they're a great place to develop and test an ebuild without fear of breaking the main Gentoo Portage package tree.</li>
<li>Not every ebuild belongs in the Gentoo Portage package tree.  An overlay is a great place to store an ebuild until it is ready to go into the Gentoo Portage package tree.</li>
</ul>
</body>

<section>
<title>What Is overlays.gentoo.org?</title>
<body>
<p><uri link="http://overlays.gentoo.org">overlays.gentoo.org</uri> provides social workspaces to allow Gentoo projects,
developers and users to collaborate together on tomorrow's Gentoo packages.
We do this by host overlays for Gentoo projects, and overlays for Gentoo
developers.</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Are All Official Overlays Hosted On overlays.gentoo.org?</title>
<body>
<p>No.  Gentoo developers are free to put their overlay wherever suits them best; they don't have to use overlays.gentoo.org if they don't want to.</p>

<title>Getting Started With Overlays</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Use Gunnar Wrobel's layman to easily install and update overlays over
time.</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Installing Layman</title>
<body>
<p>To install layman, follow these steps:</p>
<pre caption="Installing layman">
<i>emerge layman</i>
<i>echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf</i>
</pre>
<note>
Layman will create "/usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" once you
add your first overlay. But if you do not plan to install an overlay
immediately you should ensure that this file actually
exists. Otherwise portage will complain. It does not need to have any
content so you can run "touch /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf".
</note>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Listing The Overlays Available</title>
<body>
<p>To see the list of overlays available, run:</p>
<pre caption="Listing the available overlays">layman -L</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Installing An Overlay</title>
<body>
<p>To install an overlay on your computer, run:</p>
<pre caption="Adding an overlay">
layman -a &lt;overlay-name&gt;
</pre>
<p>For example, to install <uri link="http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/php">the PHP overlay</uri>, run:</p>
<pre caption="Adding the PHP overlay">
layman -a php
</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Installing Packages From An Overlay</title>
<body>
<p>After installing an overlay, you can install packages from it by running:</p>
<pre caption="Installing A Package From An Overlay">
emerge -av &lt;category&gt;/&lt;package&gt;
</pre>
<p>Portage automatically searches your main Portage tree (in /usr/portage), and
all of the overlays that you've installed, and picks the latest version of the
package that it can find.</p>

<p>If Portage isn't picking up the package from the overlay, that's normally
because the package is marked ~arch, where "arch" is the architecture of your
computer (normally x86).</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Updating An Overlay</title>
<body>
<p>To keep your installed overlays up to date, run:</p>
<pre caption="Updating All Installed Overlays">
layman --sync ALL
</pre>
<p>Please don't run this more than once a day, or you'll put too much strain on
Gentoo's infrastructure.</p>

<title>How To Get More Involved</title>

<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>
<p>All Gentoo developers were users of Gentoo before they became developers.  Our users aren't just the reason Gentoo exists today; they're our future volunteers too.</p>

<p>If you start contributing to a project, we'll give you write access to the
project's overlay, and we'll provide mentors to help you contribute.
Eventually, if we like what you do and the way you do it, we'll invite you to
go the whole hog and become a full Gentoo developer, with a nice shiny
@gentoo.org email address.</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>How To Get Started</title>
<body>
<p>If you want to contribute to an overlay, the best approach is to build a good
working relationship with the Gentoo developers who are responsible for the
overlay.  You can find out who is responsible for each overlay by going to
<uri link="http://overlays.gentoo.org">overlays.gentoo.org's homepage</uri>, and clicking on the link for the overlay in question.</p>

<p>Different developers preferred to be contacted in different ways.  Some hang
out on IRC, and may have their own channels for their projects.  Examples of
these include the PHP project (#gentoo-php), and the Webapps project
(#gentoo-web).  Others prefer to be contacted by email only.  The only way
you'll find out is to try and make contact, and take it from there.</p>

<section>
<title>Working With Subversion</title>
<body>
<p>You'll need to get comfortable working with Subversion.  Subversion is the
version control software we use to manage the contents of our overlays.  If you have never used Subversion before, the <uri link="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">online book</uri> is an excellent way to learn Subversion.  You can buy it in dead-tree format too if you prefer.</p>
</body>

<section>
<title>Further Information</title>
<body>
<p>The Gentoo project (or developer) you're working with should be able to
provide you with any further help and assistance that you need.</p>

<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Q: Do you host overlays for users?</p>
<ul>
<li>A: No, we do not.  If you want an overlay of your own on o.g.o, you must first become a Gentoo developer.</li>
