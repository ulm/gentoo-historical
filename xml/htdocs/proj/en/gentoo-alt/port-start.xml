<p>
Starting a new Gentoo/ALT port is not too difficult, when you know how to do it
and what needs to be considered. This guide will explain the basic generic
steps needed to start the porting work.
</p>

<p>
Because of the Linux nature or the base of Gentoo/ALT structure, some of the
internals are based on an Unix-like structure, while the QA checks on the
compiled binaries are done considering ELF binaries as result. Tweaking of these
checks is a complex process and needs to be done with the help of the devs who
wrote those checks. For this reason, they won't be treated in this guide.
</p>

<p>
There are quite a few decision that one should start looking at when starting a
new Gentoo/ALT project, as therea are many different parameters that might
change the way the changes should be made. For every decision, this guide will
try to provide a selection of problems and solution to them, trying to give
help for every case.
</p>

<p>
You probably can try to port Gentoo/ALT on different conditions than the ones
explained here. They are just general guidelines to explain how the things were
done on current working ports.

<title>Support</title>

<body>

<p>
It's usually useful, when creating a new port, to get in touch with the other
developers working on Gentoo/ALT. This can be done through the <c>gentoo-alt</c>
<uri link="/main/en/lists.xml">mailing list </uri> or through the channel
<c>#gentoo-alt</c> on Freenode network.
</p>

<p>
Mailing list and IRC channel are a good way to ask for solution to problems that
are not treated in this guide (because of difference in the environment or
simply because they were not present a tthe time of writing), and to follow the
development of common decision inside and outside the project.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you're going to use Gentoo Portage for your port, you probably also
want to watch the <c>alt@gentoo.org</c> mail alias on
<uri link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/">Bugzilla</uri> to see what is going on with
portability of most ebuilds or scripts or other things that you might encounter
in your process.

<section> <!-- Choices -->
<title>Choices</title>

<body>

<p>
There are many choices one have to do when starting a Gentoo/ALT project. The
first and probably most important one is to choose if making a primary package
manager or a secondary. The first case is what is being done by Gentoo/FreeBSD,
while the latter is what is being done by Gentoo/OSX.
</p>

<p>
After deciding this there are other things that should be consdiered, starting,
for example, from the kind of init system you want to use, if you want to just
use the one used by your operating system, or replace it with the one used by
Gentoo Linux.
</p>

<p>
Every decision has its own rights and wrongs, and they should always be chosen
carefully. Sometimes it's also possible to provide different implementations
that allow the user to select what wants to do.
