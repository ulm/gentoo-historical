<description>FreeBSD-based Gentoo system</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
Gentoo/FreeBSD (or Gentoo/FBSD, or G/FBSD) is an effort to create a complete
<uri link="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</uri>-based Gentoo system, sharing
the complete administration facilities of Gentoo with the reliability of the
FreeBSD kernel and userland.
</p>
<p>
An experimental, yet incomplete release have been done, and it's possible
to install Gentoo/FreeBSD following the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">
install guide</uri>.
</p>
<p>
This project is still in its infancy. If you are interested in working on it,
please send an email to the <mail link="bsd@gentoo.org">Gentoo/*BSD</mail>
team.
</p>

    Gentoo/FreeBSD needs more people testing software, hoping that packages stabilization
    may happen at some point. Looking for a challenge or interested in the features of
    FreeBSD is welcome.
  </details> 
  <requirements>
    Familiarity with ebuilds, portage, BSD and POSIX standards, no extreme hardware is required
    any kind of virtual machine will also do.
    Be bugzilla, mailing list, and irc friendly.

  <summary>Team Members</summary>
  <details>
    New bugs show up almost on each -random package- update, an understaffed team can quickly
    become demotivated by just looking at the sheer ammount of upgrades that don't build.
    Thus the more people hunting new bugs, the merrier. 
  </details>
  <requirements>
    Willingness to cooperate with upstream maintainers so that fixes are permanent and they don't
    spawn again after each bump. Knowledge of alternate POSIX is very welcome.

  <summary>Debuggers</summary>
  <details>
    Even if the @system set works pretty decently, there are some areas that require deeper
    investigation, from the clash of the very up-to-date toolchain that we use in Gentoo with
    the conservative BSD userland, there are some things that don't work 100%, ie: gdb debugging.
  </details>
  <requirements>
    Experience debugging C code and toolchain bugs, library linking, frame unwinding, etc. Not
    afraid of running a gcc testsuite, nor afraid of submitting bug reports upstream.

<title>Mini FAQ</title>

<section>
<body>

<p>
<b>1. Is Gentoo/FreeBSD just a portage on top of FreeBSD system?</b><br />
No, Gentoo/FreeBSD aims to provide a complete FreeBSD-based system using Gentoo
design principles. This means that it's going to use the Gentoo init system,
administration utilities and toolchain support.
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Which toolchain is being used to build the system?</b><br />
Gentoo toolchain is being used. This means that GCC can be chosen between the
currently available versions in portage (4.2, 4.3 and 4.4), and the same
goes with binutils, for which the needed patch form FreeBSD has already been
forwardported (and applied upstream for 2.17 series, currently running well on 2.20).
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Is Stack Smashing Protection supported?</b><br />
Yes, as we use Gentoo toolchain we also have GCC patched with Propolice, and
since the introduction of FreeBSD-8.0 the base system is patched to support SSP by default. 
The linkage of local SSP symbols is done using a linker script thanks to the newer binutils
available, while on vanilla FreeBSD it's being done directly on the gcc-spec, this method
also avoids text relocations making SSP support pretty clean.

<title>Building a Gentoo/FreeBSD crosscompiler</title>

<section> <!-- Introduction -->
<title>Introduction</title>

<body>

<p>
Complementing the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/cross-compiling-distcc.xml">DistCC Cross-compiling Guide</uri>,
this document will explain how to build a Gentoo/FreeBSD crosscompiler, as for
now it's not yet entirely automated.
</p>

<p>
The instruction here given works for building crosscompilers to Gentoo/FreeBSD,
as they use the ebuilds currently in portage. They might not work entirely for
generic vanilla FreeBSD as there are a few things that change, but you should be okay.
</p>

<p>
Please if you find a problem with these when building a generic FreeBSD cross
compiler don't open a bug report unless you also have a patch, as there're not
enough people working on Gentoo/FreeBSD to support vanilla FreeBSD building.
</p>

<title>Prerequisites and crossdev</title>

<body>

<p>
Before going to use crossdev you need to install some prerequisites that are
needed to complete the building of a stage4 compiler (C++ compiler). These are
needed because <c>crossdev</c> does not merge them before the rest.
</p>

<p>
The first package you need is <c>virtual/pmake</c>, or directly
<c>sys-devel/pmake</c>, that provides a BSD-compatible <c>make</c> command,
needed to build headers and the base library for Gentoo/FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
The second package is a complement to the above <c>pmake</c>. Although it ships
with some files <path>.mk</path> (that contains BSD makefile templates used to
build applications using BSD style), they are too barebone to actually build
FreeBSD software, so you need to install the file set from FreeBSD. The ebuild
is <c>sys-freebsd/freebsd-mk-defs</c> and it's crosscompile aware: when building
on a non-FreeBSD system it installs in <path>/usr/share/mk/freebsd</path> and
uses GNU syntaxes.
</p>

<p>
The third package is <c>sys-apps/mtree</c>, that provides the BSD <c>mtree</c> command,
needed to build Gentoo/FreeBSD headers.
</p>

<note>
You might have <c>sys-freebsd/freebsd-mk-defs</c> masked by keyword, please
refer to the arch team of your architecture for its keywording.
</note>

<p>
Then you just need to use <c>sys-devel/crossdev</c> to build the crosscompiler
you want. Please note that the version specified in CHOST has to be the same
as the one used for <c>freebsd-lib</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Building a crosscompiler for Gentoo/FreeBSD 6.1">
# <i>crossdev -s4 --gcc 4.4.3 --libc '8.0*' --target i686-gentoo-freebsd8.0 --with-headers</i>
</pre>

<p>
The version of libc has to be accorded ot the version of FreeBSD you
want to build for, while the <c>--with-headers</c> option to crossdev forces
it to build the headers before <c>gcc</c> itself.
