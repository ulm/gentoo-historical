<description>FreeBSD-based Gentoo system</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
Gentoo/FreeBSD (or Gentoo/FBSD, or G/FBSD) is an effort to create a complete
<uri link="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</uri>-based Gentoo system, sharing
the complete administration facilities of Gentoo with the reliability of the
FreeBSD kernel and userland.
</p>
<p>
An experimental, yet incomplete release have been done, and it's possible
to install Gentoo/FreeBSD following the <uri link="/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">
install guide</uri>.
</p>
<p>
This project is still in its infancy. If you are interested in working on it,
please send an email to the <mail link="bsd@gentoo.org">Gentoo/*BSD</mail>
team.

<p>
<b>1. Is Gentoo/FreeBSD just a portage on top of FreeBSD system?</b><br />
No, Gentoo/FreeBSD aims to provide a complete FreeBSD-based system using Gentoo
design principles. This means that it's going to use the Gentoo init system,
administration utilities and toolchain support.
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Which toolchain is being used to build the system?</b><br />
Gentoo toolchain is being used. This means that GCC can be chosen between the
currently available versions in portage (3.3, 3.4, 4.0 and 4.1), and the same
goes with binutils, for which the needed patch form FreeBSD has already been
forwardported (and applied upstream for 2.17 series).
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Is Stack Smashing Protection supported?</b><br />
Yes, as we use Gentoo toolchain we also have GCC patched with Propolice, and
since 2 May 2006 the base system is patched to support SSP by default. The
implementation is not yet perfect as there are things that needs to be cleaned
up, but it works.
