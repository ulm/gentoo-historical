		Running Gentoo on an OpenBSD base system.
	</description>
	<longdescription> 
		<p>
			An effort to provide a true Gentoo experience on top
			of a base 
			<uri link="http://www.openbsd.com">OpenBSD</uri> 
			system.  The first step was to create
			a tarball of portage + support apps so that portage would
			function on OpenBSD; that has been finished for a while.
			The next step was to create an 
			<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/~g2boojum/obsd/obsd34/gentoo-obsd-3.4.iso">iso</uri> 
			to make installation
			easier; also finished.  Current efforts are focusing on
			getting sandbox ported to the *BSD libc and slowly patching
			packages (and, in some cases, portage itself) to handle
			the BSD libc and filesystem heirarchy.  The next "big"
			item on the todo list is to hack the Gentoo init scripts
			so that they can be run from OpenBSD's init.
