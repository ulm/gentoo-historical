	</description>
	<longdescription> 
		<p>
			An effort to provide a true Gentoo experience on top
			of a base 
			<uri link="http://www.openbsd.com">OpenBSD</uri> 
			system.  The first step was to create
			a tarball of portage + support apps so that portage would
			function on OpenBSD; that has been finished for a while.
			The next step was to create an 
			<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/~g2boojum/obsd/obsd34/gentoo-obsd-3.4.iso">iso</uri> 
			to make installation easier; also finished.
