<description>Running Gentoo on an OpenBSD base system.</description>

<longdescription> 
<p>
An effort to provide a true Gentoo experience on top of a base
<uri link="http://www.openbsd.com">OpenBSD</uri> system. The first step was to
create a tarball of portage + support apps so that portage would function on
OpenBSD; that has been finished for a while. The next step was to create an
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/~g2boojum/obsd/obsd34/gentoo-obsd-3.4.iso">iso</uri>
to make installation easier; also finished.
</p>
<p>
This project is currently dead. If you want to work on it, please send an
e-mail to <mail link="bsd@gentoo.org"> Gentoo/*BSD team</mail>.
</p>

<note>
Currently this project lacks maintainer, developers, lead, and is almost dead.
New developers should probably restart the work on this from scratch, also if
it's probably possible to reuse part of the work done for Gentoo/FreeBSD and
Gentoo/NetBSD.
