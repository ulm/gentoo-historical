        <p>
          The Gentoo for Mac OS X project tries to make the rich
          Portage tree available for Mac OS X users.  The nature of the
          OS X operating system, which is based on the open source
          Darwin kernel, allows many applications to be compiled and run
          on OS X.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many ways in which Gentoo can be applied to Mac OS
          X.  This document tries to outline these ways and point out
          the current focus of development.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two relevant concepts that need to be understood
          before we can delve into the different routes there are.  On
          the one hand, there is the Portage software, which is unique
          for the Gentoo distribution.  Portage is sometimes considered
          to be "just another package manager", but is primarily
          focussed on building applications from source.  On the other
          hand, there finally is the 'tree' that the Portage software
          uses.  The tree contains the packages, how to download,
          compile and install them.  Both are useless without each
          other, as an engine without fuel clearly doesn't run, while
          fuel without an engine doesn't make you move either.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 'Gentoo' in "Gentoo Portage" not only tells the Portage
          software is developed and used by Gentoo, but also that the
          tree is utilises is one that is built for the Gentoo
          distribution: a GNU/Linux distribution.  It is important to
          note that the tree encodes logic and assumptions.  For the
          Gentoo tree this currently means it contains GNU/Linux logic
          and assumptions for mainly the x86 architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, a package manager can be primary, or secondary.  In
          the first case, the package manager is responsible for
          building the (core) system, while in the latter case, the
          package manager builds on top of an existing system to enhance
          it.  Please note that this is by no means meant as a formal
          definition of the general concept "package manager".  Within
          this document it is used as entity that is natively
          responsible for managing software packages on the OS it works
          on.  Effectively, this means that Gentoo Portage is not the
          primary package manager on Mac OS X.  Gentoo Portage is the
          primary package manager on its GNU/Linux distribution, and as
          such, the Gentoo Portage tree matches this goal.
        </p>

    <section><!-- {{{ Gentoo for Mac OS X -->
      <title>Gentoo for Mac OS X</title>
      <body>

        <p>
          Gentoo for Mac OS X is the Gentoo Portage software, and its
          tree put on top of Mac OS X, just as it would be on a
          GNU/Linux system where Portage would be the primary package
          manager.  However, Portage will not manage the (core) system
          packages, because doing so might break the OS it is running on
          (which has its own package manager).
        </p>

        <p>
          The current incorporation of the Gentoo for Mac OS X project
          in the Gentoo tree is like this.  It installs files in the
          same places as it would on a GNU/Linux system, in the same
          directory as the OS itself places its files.  This behaviour
          has its advantages and disadvantages.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Because Portage installs next to the OS, in the same
            directories, no fancy path settings are necessary,
            everything is installed in default places.  Note that the
            relatively large overlap of the Gentoo Linux file system
            layout and Darwin's one, causes this advantage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Portage can use tools provided by the OS, this avoids
            unnecessary compilation and waste of space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a tool provided by the OS is outdated, or not recent
            enough, Portage cannot update it without overwriting the OS
            provided one.  Note that this doesn't necessarily have to be
            a drawback, as from a progressive viewpoint this allows more
            control over the system, e.g. breaking a possible lock-in by
            the OS vendor.  In that sense, also downgrading a package
            version applies.
          </li>
          <li>
            The vendor of the OS that provides a tool, might have
            changed the behaviour of the tool for some reason.  The
            Gentoo Portage tree doesn't know about this, which can cause
            trouble.  In such case the tree has to be modified in order
            to use it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because Portage installs its files next to where the OS
            installs them, the primary package manager of the OS might
            install a package and overwrite files provided by Portage.
            It might be hard for Portage to figure this out in time, and
            possibly execute correcting actions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In reality, this route seems to be a nightmare, even though
          the advantages look nice.  Many of the tools provided by Mac
          OS X are too outdated or just slightly different.  This causes
          a lot of packages not being able to compile because of unmet
          dependencies, which would collide with the OS.  Many changes
          made to the Portage tree are also not always trivial.

      <title>Darwin Portage</title>
      <body>

        <p>
          To overcome the problems of outdated software, and Portage not
          being able to update them -- because it is a secondary package
          manager -- Portage can be made the primary package manager.
          This involves support in Portage's tree to build an OS X
          system up from the ground.
        </p>

        <p>
          The open source projects behind Apple's Mac OS X are made
          available through the Darwin project.  As such, a tree can be
          built which uses these sources.  Non open source proprietary
          Apple packages can be installed on top of it using official
          Apple Mac OS X distribution media.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Because Portage is the primary package manager, it is in
            full control, and no collisions with another package manager
            will happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since Portage will be the one to decide how and when the OS
            and extra tools are installed, it will be possible to leave
            out much unwanted software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building a system from scratch requires skills, usually not
            available to Mac OS X users.  It also involves more
            knowledge of the system, as Apple's tools to update the
            system will probably not work, or hork the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            A tree that encodes the logic and assumptions of the Darwin
            software packages needs to be built.  The question remains
            how much of the efforts of the Gentoo Portage tree can be
            reused for this.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All in all, this way is attractive to skilled system
          administrators, and it offers a wide variety of solutions or
          extra opportunities.  However, it seriously affects the
          system, and it remains questionable whether such system can be
          called a Mac OS X system.  Several efforts will have to be
          spent to make this work.

      <title>Gentoo Portage for Mac OS X</title>
      <body>

        <p>
          With a slight difference in the name from the current project
          form, Gentoo Portage for Mac OS X tries to use the Gentoo
          Portage tree to its full extend on an Mac OS X system by
          letting Portage be as close as possible to a primary package
          manager, while in fact being a secondary package manager.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although it might sound like a contradiction in terminis, in
          this direction Portage is made a primary package manager,
          while in fact it functions as a secondary one.  This is
          possible by giving Portage its own corner in the file system,
          allowing it to fill it as it desires to build up a system
          there.  This requires Portage to be able to install in a so
          called 'prefix', which is an offset given to all installed
          applications and files, such that they don't collide with the
          OS provided utils.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            By installing in a prefixed location, no collisions with OS
            provided files can exist, allowing Portage to have tools as
            up-to-date as it likes, or compiled the way it wants to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because Portage has control over each and every application
            it installs, the Gentoo Portage tree can be used for Mac OS
            X, since logic and assumptions can largerly be applied to
            the sub-system Portage creates on Mac OS X.  (The prefix.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Because Portage creates a whole sub-system, the prefix
            location is perfectly suitable for a removable medium, such
            that Portage and its installed applications can be shared,
            carried with one, or whatever.  The sub-system itself should
            run on each system that has a sufficient hardware
            architecture, which can be a great feature for many reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because Portage has to provide every tool it uses itself
            (it builds its own system), this means that many tools that
            are already available from the OS are not used, although
            perfectly suitable for the job.  Additionally, this means
            space wise many applications will be double, hence many
            bytes wasted.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Even though this solution wastes space, it does provide a
          solution for insufficient OS provided packages, as well as a
          keen focus on shareability and protection from side effects
          caused by OS upgrades or repairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          An obvious extension to this route would be to sacrify
          shareability for space, and use OS provided tools as long as
          they are sufficient.  This would require a way for Portage to
          figure out what is available in the OS, probably more dynamic
          than what is done now for "Gentoo for Mac OS X".

      <title>Current Situation</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The current state of the Mac OS X project within Gentoo
          implements the "Gentoo for Mac OS X" route.  This route has
          proven to be unsuitable for Mac OS X, as the OS itself becomes
          a too big limitation for Portage to sucessfully emerge many
          packages.  Hence, another direction is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because "Darwin Portage" requires efforts towards a tree to be
          made, and because it is a rather big difference from a regular
          Mac OS X system, it was chosen to change the direction towards
          "Gentoo Portage for Mac OS X", to enable Gentoo's Mac OS X
          project to continue and innovate again.
        </p>

        <p>
          This implies that development has shifted from the live system
          in portage to a new system only available to developers.
          Maintenance is being done, mainly for security bumps, but
          large investments are not being done, unless they are directly
          reusable in the prefixed environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Gentoo for Mac OS X installer that floats around the net
          currently is old and contains many bugs.  It has been removed
          from the official project pages, because use of it is no
          longer being supported.  We hope to release an updated
          installer to fill in this gap.
        </p>
      </body>

    <section><!-- {{{ Progress -->
      <title>Progress</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Because "Gentoo Portage for Mac OS X" requires Portage to be
          able to install in a prefix in order to create a sub-system,
          Portage first has to be able to properly do this.  After this,
          the Gentoo Portage tree has to be converted to be
          prefix-aware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prefix support in Portage has reached an alpha level in the
          development branches.  This -- at the moment clumsy -- but
          more or less usuable product is used to find out what changes
          will be necessary to the Gentoo Portage tree.  The major work
          of making Portage prefix aware has been done, and the
          functionality has to mature.  The feature is considered all
          but stable.  Portage development in this area is done with
          support from the Portage Development Team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the Prefixed portage is more or less usuable, a few
          Gentoo for Mac OS X developers have it installed to experiment
          with it.  Because the changes that need to be made require
          ebuild modifications that are not backwards compatible,
          applications are currently ported in an overlay.  This overlay
          currently contains applications like perl, python, apple-gcc,
          vim, sed, awk, find, etc.  A full base install is covered
          based on ebuild in the Gentoo Portage tree.
