          Bootstrapping is the process required to get Prefixed Portage
          installed on your system.  Although we currently only have an
          in-depth description of how to bootstrap on OSX systems, these
          instructions in general work on other systems too.  Examples
          are RedHat Linux Enterprise Server for Itanium and Fedora Core
          4 Linux on AMD64.

        <p>
          The <c>bootstrap-prefix.sh</c> script is a sort of kickstart
          in the bootstrap process.  It automates downloading the
          portage tree, installing portage and the necessary temporary
          helper applications.  In addition it tries to setup a profile
          and some settings where it can.

    <title>Bootstrapping on OS X</title>

        <p>
          Apple Mac OS X was initially supported in the main Gentoo
          portage tree with the ppc-macos keyword.  The approach taken
          then, however, resulted in too many problems, which was the
          drive behind creating prefixed portage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bootstrapping on OS X is relatively simple, as the system
          itself provides most of the tools get up to speed quickly.
          Prefixed Portage is tested and supported on Mac OS X Tiger on
          PPC and x86 architectures.  Tests on PPC Panther were
          successful, but the platform itself isn't fully supported.

        <p>
          As prerequisite, you have to have Xcode installed.  Xcode
          provides the compiler collection.  Bootstrapping is not
          (yet) supported without it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step is to chose a path to install into.  We refer
          to this path as "prefix path", stored in the variable
          <c>$EPREFIX</c>.  Some suggestions for your prefix path are
          <path>~/Gentoo</path> or <path>~/Library/Gentoo</path>.
          Whatever you chose, make sure you set it in your environment:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Export EPREFIX variable">
$ <i>export EPREFIX="~/Gentoo"</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Next, add the following paths in your soon to be prefix to
          your <c>PATH</c> environment.
          <path>$EPREFIX/bin</path>,
          <path>$EPREFIX/usr/bin</path>,
          <path>$EPREFIX/tmp/bin</path> and
          <path>$EPREFIX/tmp/usr/bin</path>.
          Adding these paths makes sure that they will be available
          later on in the process.
        </p>
        <pre caption="Add prefix paths to your PATH">
$ <i>export PATH="$EPREFIX/usr/bin:$EPREFIX/bin:$EPREFIX/tmp/usr/bin:$EPREFIX/tmp/bin:$PATH"</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now the path is set, start with downloading the bootstrap
          script from
          <uri>http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/alt/browser/trunk/prefix-overlay/scripts/bootstrap-prefix.sh?format=txt</uri>.
          From the directory where the bootstrap script was stored execute
          the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Use the bootstrap script">
$ <i>chmod 755 bootstrap-prefix.sh</i>
$ <i>./bootstrap-prefix.sh $EPREFIX tree</i>
$ <i>./bootstrap-prefix.sh $EPREFIX/tmp wget</i>
$ <i>./bootstrap-prefix.sh $EPREFIX/tmp sed</i>
$ <i>./bootstrap-prefix.sh $EPREFIX/tmp python</i>
$ <i>./bootstrap-prefix.sh $EPREFIX portage</i>
        </pre>
        <note>Please note that <c>wget</c>, <c>sed</c> and <c>python</c> are
          installed in <path>$EPREFIX/tmp</path>!</note>
        <p>
          The script will setup the <path>$EPREFIX</path>
          directory, download a portage tree snapshot, unpack it and
          download and install portage.  Afterwards it will try to setup
          some sane defaults.  We continue with a little hack necessary
          for a successful bootstrap:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Setup ld wrapper scripts">
$ <i>./bootstrap-prefix.sh $EPREFIX ldwrapper</i>
$ <i>mv $EPREFIX/usr/bin/ld* $EPREFIX/tmp/usr/bin/</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Because we installed some new applications, we will instruct
          bash to reconsider all paths we have:
        </p>
        <pre caption="rehash in bash">
$ <i>hash -r</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We continue adding some necessary tools which will deal with
          many errors and warnings you might see during emerging.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge sed">
$ <i>emerge sed</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Next, we emerge the <c>bash</c> shell and its dependency
          ncurses.  <c>bash</c> is used extensively within portage and
          other applications.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge bash">
$ <i>emerge bash</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We continue getting some autotools stuff into our prefix.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge autotools">
$ <i>emerge --nodeps "=autoconf-2.1*" "=autoconf-2.6*" "autoconf-wrapper"</i>
$ <i>emerge --nodeps "=automake-1.4*" "=automake-1.5*" "=automake-1.6*" "=automake-1.7*" "=automake-1.8*" "automake-wrapper"</i>
        </pre>
        <note><c>automake-1.9</c> and <c>libtool</c> are not (yet)
          installed at this stage.</note>
        <p>
          Next, we have to get some tools in order to finalise getting
          the autotools in our prefix.  Because we installed <c>wget</c>
          in a temporary location, let's not forget to install it
          properly by emerging it now:
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge wget">
$ <i>emerge --nodeps wget</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          After this we can emerge texinfo, which <c>automake-1.9</c>
          needs.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge texinfo">
$ <i>emerge --nodeps texinfo</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now we can finish installing the autotools:
        </p>
        <pre caption="finalise emerge autotools">
$ <i>emerge --nodeps "=automake-1.9*" "=automake-1.10*"</i>
$ <i>emerge --nodeps libtool</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now we have some decent autotooling stuff around, we can get
          some decent core utilities in our prefix.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge coreutils">
$ <i>emerge --nodeps "=sys-apps/coreutils-5.94*"</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          All packages before (and including) coreutils might generate
          some errors like about <c>xargs</c> not understanding all its
          arguments.  After coreutils this issue is fixed, as coreutils
          provides the versions of these tools that portage expects ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we get GNU <c>awk</c>, as most ebuild expect this
          <c>awk</c> when they use it.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge gawk">
$ <i>emerge gawk</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Finally we emerge python in our prefix.  This is the last
          package that we temporarily installed to bootstrap our system.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge python">
$ <i>emerge --nodeps python</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Before we continue to emerge all ebuilds from <c>system</c>,
          we first install <c>portage</c>.  We need to overwrite the
          version that was installed by the bootstrap script.
          Installing a new portage will make sure it uses the tools
          provided by the prefix, and forget about the temporary
          installed tools.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge portage">
$ <i>env FEATURES="-collision-protect" emerge --nodeps portage</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We remove the temporary directory and its use:
        </p>
        <pre caption="remove tmp directory">
$ <i>rm -Rf $EPREFIX/tmp/*</i>
$ <i>hash -r</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Next, we do the real work where all packages get reemerged in
          such an order that they make use of packages in the prefix
          itself.
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge system">
$ <i>emerge -e system</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This will happily install a lot of stuff and reinstall what
          you emerged before.  This is necessary to avoid compilation
          failures due to dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have some basic stuff now, we might want the benefit
          of an updated tree.  To use it, emerge <c>subversion</c>:
        </p>
        <pre caption="emerge subversion">
$ <i>emerge subversion</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can now update the tree.  Since snapshots now are actually
          (anonymous) SVN checkouts of the tree, we can immediately use
          SVN commands on the tree instead of checking a tree out first.
          Because Portage knows how to deal with the SVN tree, and the
          bootstrap script has set a correct <c>SYNC</c> variable in
          your <path>etc/make.conf</path>, updating the tree is done
          using:
        </p>
        <pre caption="Updating the tree">
$ <i>emerge --sync</i>
        </pre>
        <note>
          The prefix portage tree assumes a <e>case-sensitive
            filesystem</e>.  Mac OS X doesn't use this by default.  If
          you experience weird errors while updating or checking out
          the prefix tree with subversion, check if your filesystem is
          case-sensitive.
        </note>
        <p>
          To really do this properly, after emerging <c>system</c>, one
          should re-emerge <c>system</c>, because now all packages can
          be compiled with all tools from the prefix, instead of based
          on tools in the system root.  Before you do though, this is
          the good time to set your general <c>USE</c>-flags, such as
          <c>nls</c> to get localised messages in
          <path>$EPREFIX/etc/make.conf</path>.  In that file, you
          can also set <c>CFLAGS</c> for your compilation.  Be
          conservative with <c>CFLAGS</c>!
        </p>
        <pre caption="Customising the prefix installation">
$ <i>echo 'USE="unicode nls"' >> $EPREFIX/etc/make.conf</i>
$ <i>echo 'CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -mcpu=G5"' >> $EPREFIX/etc/make.conf</i>
$ <i>emerge -e system</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          After <c>system</c> has emerged successfully, your prefix will
          be set up properly, and you can emerge the whichever tools you
          choose from the prefix tree.
