          What does Prefixed Portage do more?  For short, it allows to
          install packages into an offset, without root privileges.  The
          longer answer includes how this is done, and why.  To start
          with the latter one, let's see how the land of the package
          manager (Portage) looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
          A package manager can be primary, or secondary.  In the first
          case, the package manager is responsible for building the
          (core) system, while in the latter case, the package manager
          builds on top of an existing system to enhance it.  Please
          note that this is by no means meant as a formal definition of
          the general concept "package manager".  Within this document
          it is used as entity that is natively responsible for managing
          software packages on the OS it works on.  Effectively, this
          means that Gentoo Portage is not the primary package manager
          on Apple Mac OS X, Sun Solaris, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.  Gentoo
          Portage is the primary package manager on its Gentoo GNU/Linux
          distribution, and as such, the Gentoo Portage tree matches
          this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gentoo Prefix Portage is meant to be a secondary package
          manager.  Therefore it doesn't require root privileges, and
          has to install into another place than <path>/</path>, because
          there the primary package manager is already in charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gentoo Prefixed Portage started as a set of patches by Michael
          Haubenwallner, that were finally applied to a new branch of
          portage development: prefix.  In this branch, initially
          managed by Brian Harring, then later by Kito Dietrich, lots of
          development made prefix portage into what it is currently.

        <p>
          Prefixed Portage resides in the <path>prefix</path> branch of
          the main Portage Subversion repository.  Its sources can be
          inspected at
          <uri>http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/portage/main/branches/prefix/</uri>.
          <br />
          Currently, the Prefixed Portage code is very close to the
          trunk in subversion.  Patches made in the trunk usually apply
          cleanly to the prefix branch.  Hence, it is easy to keep the
          two synchronised using frequent merge operations.
        </p>

      <title>Tree state</title>
      <body>

        <p>
          Since the Gentoo Portage tree is not usable with Gentoo
          Prefixed Portage, an overlay has been created, which is
          currently hosted on
          <uri>http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/alt/browser/trunk/prefix-overlay</uri>.
          This has the disadvantage of not inheriting all packages from
          the main tree automatically.  Instead each package has to be
          converted to be prefix compatible.  Luckily for most packages
          these changes are trivial, and can be automatically performed
          by the <c>eapify</c> script, which can be found in the
          <path>scripts</path> directory of the prefix-overlay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to the main tree, the prefix tree is rather small.
          Adding packages is usually a simple job, using the tools from
          the <path>scripts</path> directory mentioned before.  Keeping
          the packages synchronised with the main tree is also
          facilitated by a script that is capable of applying the diffs
          with some intelligence between revisions.  Also "cross-diffs",
          diffs between versions to create a new ebuild version,
          retaining as much changes as added in the previous version are
          implemented, keeping the maintenance overhead rather low.
          <br />
          While the prefix tree contains enough packages to bootstrap a
          prefix system, run some editor and read mail via mutt, it
          currently lacks packages in a number of areas.  Currently
          for instance Java and XOrg are not in the tree at all.  This
          limits the number of packages in a way.  We are looking on how
          to expand on these areas.

    <title>Ebuild modifications</title>

    <section><!-- {{{ EAPI -->
      <title>Introduction of EAPI</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The variable <c>EAPI</c> is currently not used in the main
          tree.  While normal Gentoo Portage is aware of it, no ebuilds
          use it yet.  <c>EAPI</c> identifies the API portage has to
          support in order to process an ebuild.  The <c>EAPI</c> chosen
          to indicate an ebuild is ported to prefix, is "prefix".
          Hence, each ebuild that wants to be used with Gentoo Prefixed
          Portage has to declare <c>EAPI="prefix"</c>.  Typically, this
          declaration is done first thing in the ebuild after the (CVS)
          header.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section><!-- }}} -->

    <section><!-- {{{ EPREFIX -->
      <title>EPREFIX variable</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Since portage will install in an offset, called a prefix, in
          some cases it might be necessary to directly handle with this
          offset.  Some configure scripts for example require paths to
          be given next to <c>--prefix</c>, <c>--libdir</c>, etc. (all
          what <c>econf</c> covers), or some packages can't use
          <c>econf</c> at all.  For those occasions the variable
          <c>${EPREFIX}</c> is available in ebuilds and eclasses,
          pointing to the root of the offset.  For an offset
          <path>/Library/Gentoo</path> for example, the variable
          <c>${EPREFIX}</c> would contain <path>/Library/Gentoo</path>.
          This allows to easily use it for example like <c>econf
            --with-some-app="${EPREFIX}"/usr/bin/some-app</c>.
        </p>
      </body>
    </section><!-- }}} -->

    <section><!-- {{{ ED and EROOT -->
      <title>The variables ED and EROOT</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          In normal ebuilds, <c>${D}</c> refers to the destination
          directory in a temporary location before all files are
          actually merged into the live filesystem.  Since in prefix
          portage configure is run with <c>--prefix=${EPREFIX}/usr</c>
          in principle no changes are required.  However,
          for all modifications to the build image, as is common
          practise in many ebuilds, <c>${D}${EPREFIX}</c> should be
          used.  While this is a clean and logical result of using an
          offset, it increases the burden of "porting" ebuilds.  For
          this purpose the variable <c>${ED}</c> was introduced.  It
          contains the value of <c>${D}${EPREFIX}/</c> and functions as
          handy shortcut, which is easy to change.  Usually, all but one
          occurrences of <c>${D}</c> in an ebuild (or eclass) have to be
          replaced by <c>${ED}</c> to work properly in the prefix.
          Remember that when using <c>make DESTDIR="${D}" install</c> the
          <c>${D}</c> should in general <e>not</e> be changed, as
          configure was called with <c>--prefix="${EPREFIX}"/usr</c>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The variable <c>${ROOT}</c> has for the same purpose a
          corresponding <c>${EROOT}</c> which contains
          <c>${ROOT}${EPREFIX}</c>.  Often when <c>${ROOT}</c> is being
          used, this can be replaced by <c>${EROOT}</c> to add prefix
          support.
