        <p>
          Ebuilds for Gentoo Prefix need some minor modifications from
          those that exist in the "regular" Gentoo tree (known as the
          gentoo-x86 tree).  Spelling out those modifications is out of
          scope for this document, feel free to browse here:

      <title>The ecopy script</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          <c>ecopy</c>
          is a script created by the Gentoo Prefix team, and located in
          <c>${EPREFIX}/usr/portage/scripts</c>.  Its intention is to
          save people time and is mainly a wrapper for other scripts
          which will be discussed later. Its usage can be described by
          running: <c>ecopy</c>.
        </p>
        <p><c>ecopy</c> expects the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expects to be ran from the root of your overlay If you do
            not know about overlays then please see:
            <uri>http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds</uri>
            (unofficial documentation).
          </li>
          <li>
            Expects to have one and only one valid category and package
            as an argument. It should be in the form of "/" ie.
            <c>app-office/openoffice</c>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expects <c>${EPREFIX}/usr/portage/scripts</c> to be in your
            path.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expects an up-to-date Prefix tree to reliably have the
            latest scripts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The use of <c>ecopy</c> is best explained by a simple example.

          What is <c>ecopy</c> doing? In that above code snippet,
          <c>ecopy</c> first directly downloads the required files from
          <c>gentooexperimental.org</c> (ge.o).  This is intended and an
          appreciated service from the ge.o admins.  Then, <c>ecopy</c>
          runs <c>eapify</c> on the ebuild.  <c>eapify</c> basically
          does the needed gentoo-x86 -&gt; Prefix conversion.  This can
          generally be automated and works right the first time about
          85% of the time.  After <c>eapify</c>, some keyword cleanup is
          done by <c>ecleankw</c> to make it match the Prefix keywords.
          The Prefix keywords are more strictly defined than those of
          the gentoo-x86 tree.  For more information on that see <uri
            link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0053.html">GLEP
            53</uri>. Last, <c>ecopy</c> re-digests the ebuild to
          accomandate any changes.  Let it be known that you can do all
          this manually as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          While <c>eapfiy</c> (the tool that does the actual
          transformation of the ebuild) succeeds doing its job in many
          cases, it cannot be trusted to always do the right thing.
          Common mistakes made by <c>eapify</c> are related to either
          adding or omission of the <c>${EPREFIX}</c> for some component
          in the ebuild.  <c>eapify</c> doesn't catch all instances of
          what needs to be changed.  If there is e.g. any path hardcoded
          in the configure call you will need to prepend
          <c>${EPREFIX}</c> to it.  Also, <c>${D}</c> can be improperly
          expanded to <c>${ED}</c> in certain cases.  Manual review is
          always necessary.  For more details on these issues see the
          <e>Ebuild modifications</e> chapter of the <uri
            link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/techdocs.xml#doc_chap2">Gentoo

      <title>Bug Reporting</title>
	<section>
      <body>
      <p>
      Great, your package works...now what? The Gentoo Prefix team relies on
      users submitting bug reports stating if a new package works. We simply do
      not have the man power to get to our goal of having most of the packages 
      in the Prefix tree without your help.
      </p>
      <p>
      When submitting bug reports, please follow these guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Use the "Gentoo/Alt" Product with the "Prefix Support" component.
        </li>
        <li>
        Include the method of your porting efforts. Did you use ecopy, manually,
        etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        Include which changes you made *after* ecopy, preferably using a 
        diff -u
        </li>
        <li>
        Include which patches you added, preferably attached uncompressed, not
        bundled with anything else.
        </li>
        <li>
        Include emerge --info
        </li>
      </ul>
