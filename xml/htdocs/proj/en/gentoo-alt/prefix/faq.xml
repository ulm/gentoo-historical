<title>Gentoo Prefix Frequently Asked Questions</title>
  <section>
    <title>How can I contribute?</title>
    <body>
    <p>
    Due to the depth of the Gentoo Prefix project, we really like to have users
    become involved. It helps us immensely. Here are some possibilities:
  	</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Report bugs! Unreported bugs are very bad for the health of the
      project, please do report bugs
      </li>
      <li>
      Report working packages that you may have <uri
      link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/ecopy.xml">imported</uri>
      </li>
      <li>
      Test packages - We cannot make sure that every package on every arch works
      by ourselves.
      </li>
      <li>
      Bootstrapping must always work, rebootstrapping often and reporting issues
      would benefit all and you might learn something as well.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
  <title>I made a fix, what is the best way to report this?</title>
  <body>
  <p>
  The absolute best way to report fixes is through <uri
  link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">Gentoo's Bugzilla.</uri> Use the
  "Gentoo/Alt" Product with the "Prefix Support" component, or click <uri
  link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gentoo%2FAlt">here</uri>.
  The second best way is two report them on the gentoo-alt <uri
  link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml">mailing list</uri>, however, 
  items may get forgotten or overlooked on the mailing list. Finally, you may
  report items in irc, but be sure you are speaking to a Gentoo Prefix
  developer, otherwise it is likely to not be noticed.

  <section>
  <title>How mature is Gentoo Prefix?</title>
  <body>
  <p>
  Many of us use Gentoo Prefix everyday and it has been in existance since
  2004. Keep in mind that you are riding the tip of the portage code and the
  latest packages as they exist in the gentoo-x86 tree.

  Gentoo Prefix is believed to have a reasonable maturity. However, as always,
  our software comes without warranty.

  <section>
  <title>What is the "gentoo-x86 tree" ?</title>

  gentoo-x86 is what Gentoo Linux calls their tree that contains all the
  ebuilds. See <uri link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/">
  here.</uri>
