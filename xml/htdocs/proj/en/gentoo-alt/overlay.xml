<impo>
This guide is still a <e>draft</e>. It does not contain true policies about the
use of the overlay as they are not being delineated yet, 
</impo>

<p>
Gentoo/ALT projects often need to change current ebuilds to let them know about
their userland, libc or what else. These changes can be non-trivial, and should
usually be hold until the maintainer of the ebuild can take a look to the
patches and make sure that they works as intended.
</p>

<p>
The drawback is that then Gentoo/ALT users can't make use of the ebuilds on the
fly, and developers might try to do the same thing more than one time as they
might not know what the other developers worked on.
</p>

<p>
The overlay idea is took from Gentoo/FreeBSD, that used the overlay to apply
patches that involved, for example, malloc patches, userland checks and other
things that should have been reviewed before going into main tree.

<title>In and Out</title>
<body>

<p>
The overlay is intended to work as a cache of ebuilds while they are being
tested (for totally new packages) or while the patches are being reviewed by
ebuild maintainers.
</p>

<p>
In the case of packags that goes on the overlay just to wait for review
by ebuilds maintainers, their addition should be direct, with obviously the
same name of the original package. It's usually better, if the patch is
trivial, to open a bug and note that in the ChangeLog for the overlaid package
just before adding the package to the overlay itself, unless the patches needs
to be tested for a while before submitting them to the ebuild maintainer.
