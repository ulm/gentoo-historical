Gentoo Bugday is an event hosted every first saturday of a month where devs
and users get together to try and fix the most bugs during the day.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>With the high volume of bugs filed every day on bugzilla, help coming from
users with testing and fixing bugs is really appreciated - and needed. The
goal of the Bugday project is to improve the interaction between devs and
users on this important issue and encourage users to contribute.</p>

<p>Hence, every first saturday of a month, a bugday is hosted on #gentoo-bugs,
on irc.freenode.net. During the whole day, users pick bugs from the list
presented on <uri link="http://bugday.gentoo.org">bugday.gentoo.org</uri> and,
with the possible help of attending devs, try and fix them.</p>

<p>All team members can be contacted through the mail alias <mail
link="bugday@gentoo.org">bugday@gentoo.org</mail>.</p>
