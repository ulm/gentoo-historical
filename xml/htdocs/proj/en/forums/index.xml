The Gentoo Forums are a source of support for the Gentoo user community. It
allows users to post support questions that can be answered by developers and
other users alike.
</description>

<longdescription>
The Forums are a main source of contact for the user community to interact with
the Gentoo developer community as well as other users. The primary purpose of
the Forums is for users to post support questions. Many developers use the
Forums to recruit testers for their packages and to make community
announcements. Security vulnerabilities (GLSA) are also announced and archived.
There is a collection of FAQs that covers installation and administration of
Gentoo Linux.

<p>
Moderators are recruited from the Forums user community. There is a list of
qualities that are used as factors in the candidate selection:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Report <uri link="https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-525.html">Guideline
    violations</uri>
  </li>
  <li>Threads/posts that need to be moved to a different subforum</li>
  <li>Demonstrate a professional attitude and willingness to help</li> 
</ul>

Moderators must read and follow the
