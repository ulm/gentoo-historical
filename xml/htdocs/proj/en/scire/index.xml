<description>
	The Scire project aims to create a simple interface for installing, 
	configuring, updating, and managing mass numbers of client machines.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
	The Scire project aims to create a widely extensible common portal for
	administrative tasks for multiple Linux client machines.  Common tasks will
	include updating software, installing software, customizing configuration
	files, and running scripts.
	The goal of Scire is to make administration of massive networks of Linux 
	machines easy on administrators.  It will be extremely modular so as to
	allow users to create modules that extend its functionality.  This project
	is closely tied to the Gentoo Linux Installer project since it shares many
	developers.
</p>
<p>
	The Scire project is actively seeking developers for help on this project!

		<title>2006-07-05: A Long-overdue update</title>
		<body>
			<p>
				The Scire project is moving along quite nicely despite some setbacks
				from disagreements on the implementation of various componenets of
				the system.  The UI is progressing slowly but surely, and the backend
				is able to connect and authenticate from client to server.  There is
				still TONS left to do but at least it's a start.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have been blessed this summer with the addition of Matt Disney, a
				Google Summer of Code student, who will be working on the project and
				hopefully getting the backend operational by the end of the summer.
