<longname>Gentoo Quality Assurance</longname>
<description>
The Quality Assurance Project provides an umbrella project for keeping
Gentoo's portage tree in a consistent state across all the architectures.
This means that syntax, dependencies (both compile-time and run-time), 
file sizes, changelog and metadata entries are all kept up to date and as
accurate as possible.
</description>

<longdescription><p>
The Gentoo Quality Assurance Project aims to keep the portage tree in a consistent
state.  We work with other teams to address problems found with their packages, and
create QA policies that reflect the best practices to follow when working on ebuilds.
In addition to that, we keep up to date technical documentation to assist developers
with working on packages in the tree, in a general sense.

<p>
All current and future Gentoo developers should endeavour to be a part of the
QA project in some fashion. This includes helping to come up with a QA policy,
as well as doing your part to ensure that your packages meet a certain set of QA
standards. Additionally, we hope that all Gentoo developers will be co-operative
in finding and fixing QA issues.  Future and prospective developers can contact
our <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel">recruiters</uri>.
