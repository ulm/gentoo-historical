<description>
The Quality Assurance Project provides an umbrella project for keeping
Gentoo's portage tree in a consistent state across all the architectures.
This means that syntax, dependencies (both compile-time and run-time), 
file sizes, changelog and metadata entries are all kept up to date and as
accurate as possible.

All current and future Gentoo developers should endeavour to be a part of the
QA project in some fashion. This includes helping to come up with a QA policy,
as well as doing your part to ensure that your packages meet a certain set of QA
standards. Additionally, we hope that all Gentoo developers will be co-operative
in finding and fixing QA issues.  Future and prospective developers can contact
our <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel">recruiters</uri>.
