<description>
  	The Quality Assurance Project provides an umbrella project for keeping
	Gentoo's portage tree in a consistent state across all the architectures.
	This means that syntax, dependencies (both compile-time and run-time), 
	file sizes, changelog and metadata entries are all kept up to date and as
	accurate as possible.

	<p>
		All current and future Gentoo developers should endeavour to be a part of the QA project in some fashion.  This includes helping to come up with a QA policy, as well as doing your part to ensure that your packages meet a certain set of QA standards.   Additionally, we hope that all Gentoo developers will be co-operative in finding and fixing QA issues.  Future and prospective developers can contact our
