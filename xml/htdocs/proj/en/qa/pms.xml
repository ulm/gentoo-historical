    The Package Manager Specification aims to document what is required of a Gentoo package
    manager, and what ebuilds may assume about their environment.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
    <p>
      In the past, the ebuild environment has been defined by what Portage has supported. With the
      advent of alternative package managers, this ill-defined standard is no longer sufficient. The
      Package Manager Specification (PMS) aims to solve this by defining, independent of any package
      manager, what is and is not allowed in the tree, and what ebuilds may assume about their
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also required to document what each value of the EAPI ebuild variable actually means. At
      present PMS aims only to document EAPI=0, which will provide a base on top of which other
      values may be defined. These other EAPI values will be added to the specification once their
      meanings have been finalised.
