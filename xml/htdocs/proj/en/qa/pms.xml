    The Package Manager Specification aims to document what is required of a Gentoo package manager,
    and what ebuilds may assume about their environment.
  </description>

  <longdescription>
    <p>
      In the past, the ebuild environment has been defined by what Portage has supported. With the
      advent of alternative package managers, this ill-defined standard is no longer sufficient. The
      Package Manager Specification (PMS) aims to solve this by defining, independent of any package
      manager, what is and is not allowed in the tree, and what ebuilds may assume about their
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also required to document what each value of the EAPI ebuild variable actually means.
      At present PMS aims to document all Council-approved EAPIs and the kdebuild EAPIs designed by
      the Gentoo KDE project.
