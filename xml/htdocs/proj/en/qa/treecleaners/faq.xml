<title>Gentoo TreeCleaner Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<section>
<title>I'm a Gentoo Developer. Will TreeCleaners remove my package for me?</title>
<body>
<p>Short answer: no. The TreeCleaner project encourages maintainers to remove
their own packages. If you no longer wish to maintain a package, you should
consider reassigning it to maintainer-needed, to indicate its unmaintained
status.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>TreeCleaners are removing a package I use! What should I do?</title>
<body>
<p>Please comment on the removal bug (it should be apparent in the masking).
If there isn't one, please tell us in #gentoo-treecleaners on irc.freenode.org.
If you are interested in maintaining the package, you should contact the
proxy-maintainer project by emailing <mail>proxy-maint@gentoo.org</mail>.

<section>
<title>What resources do TreeCleaners provide?</title>
<body>
<p>TreeCleaners provide some documentation on their policy. We also provide
some tools to aid package maintainer who wish to mask/remove a package. We
have an overlay where removed packages are moved to and we hope to have a
database containing treecleaner information (package removal history etc)
available soon.

<section>
<title>I'm a Gentoo dev. I want to fix a maintainer-needed package.
Do I have to support it forever now?</title>
<body>
<p>Not at all. While the 'you clean up your own mess' rule applies, it
only applies to that commit - you are not expected to look after that
package any more.
