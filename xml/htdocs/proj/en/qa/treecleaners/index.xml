<longname>Gentoo Tree Cleaning Tream</longname>
<description>
The Tree Cleaning Team is primarily concerned with removing unmaintained
and broken packages from the tree.  We aim to make less work for everyone as
there are less packages in the tree.  We also aim to increase the user
experience by removing broken packages from the tree.

<title>Criteria for Removal</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
The goal of the tree cleaning project is not to remove packages that
developers are willing to work on.  To this end there exists certain
criteria that must be met for a package to be eligible for removal by
the tree cleaning project.  They are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Package has open bugs on the Gentoo bugzilla.  These open bugs
are assigned to maintainer-needed and have typically been neglected for
some time.  It is the policy of the tree cleaning project to attempt to fix
simple bugs (such as a bad DEPEND atom, minor QA violations, and simple
revbumps), however fixing of simple bugs is not required.  Especially in
the case where a package has only simple bug filed against it, it is often
easier to just fix the bug as opposed to removing it from the tree (a
process that takes a bit of work).</li>
    <li>Package has no active maintainer.  This can mean any of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>The package has no metadata.xml.</li>
            <li>The package is assigned to maintainer-needed.</li>
            <li>The team who oversees the package's herd has been contacted
and no one has shown interest.</li>
            <li>The listed maintainer has shown no interest and does not 
respond to e-mails or on bugs.gentoo.org.</li>
            <li>The listed maintainer is no longer a Gentoo developer.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>    
    <li>Package should have dead or unresponsive upstream.  If upstream isn't
taking or fixing bugreports this causes problems as Gentoo relies heavily on
upstream in many cases.  Note the wording here is <b>should</b>, packages
are not required to have a dead upstream, this is merely a heuristic that the
tree cleaning project relies on.</li>
</ol>
