<description>
The Tree Cleaning Team is primarily concerned with removing unmaintained
and broken packages from the tree.  We aim to make less work for everyone
by reducing the number of broken and unmaintained packages in the tree.  
We also aim to increase the user experience by removing broken packages 
from the tree; therefore users have less hair-raising experiences with
packages in-tree that just don't work.

<longdescription>
Gentoo currently has a number of packages that lack maintainers and are
broken in one or more ways.  Due to the large number of packages that
exhibit this behavior in the gentoo package database the tree cleaner
subproject was created.   The overall goal of this subproject is to reduce
the number of unmaintained and broken packages in the tree.  This is
accomplished by either finding a maintainer for the package, fixing the
package, or removing the package from the package database.

To find and remove broken and unmaintained packages from the tree.

<extraproject name="Gentoo Packages that Need Lovin'">
<p>The GPNL is a set of pages that is currently under development to list packages
that need maintainers.  At present it is only an idea with no scripts driving it,
however integration with packages.gentoo.org is being considered as it already has
most of what a GPNL site would need.  Package search, package metadata, bugs links,
really only herdstat integration is the major component left.

<title>Gentoo Packages that Need Lovin' (GPNL)</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Removing a package isn't the only solution offered by the tree cleaner project.
The project strives to maintain a list of packages that have no maintainer.  This
package list is created by two methods.  One is to look in the tree for packages
lacking a metadata.xml file.  The second is to look at packages assigned to
maintainer-needed in metadata.xml.  The final method involves looking on bugs for
bugs assigned to maintainer-needed.  All of these methods are combined to create
the <uri link="http://spaceparanoids.org/gentoo/gpnl/">Gentoo Packages that Need
Lovin' (GPNL)</uri> list.  This exists to encourage users and developers to locate
neglected packages and fix any problems that they may have.  The GPNL is still under
active development.

<title>CVS Attic</title>
<body>
<p>
All ebuilds, including deleted ones, are available from the web
interface to Gentoo's CVS repository, which you can find at 
<uri link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/">http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/.</uri>
Ebuilds and directories that have been removed will appear in the Attic, and can be
accessed by clicking the (Show &lt;n&gt; dead files) link at the top of the
folder view. You can then download any ebuilds you may need from
ViewCVS and place them in a local overlay, where they can be installed
as normal. Any distribution files will remain on Gentoo's mirrors for
at least two weeks after the ebuild is removed from the tree, and even
after removal from our mirrors they will in most cases continue to be
available from the original source.

<title>But I love that package!</title>
<body>
<p>I'm glad you like that package, however without a maintainer it sits stale in
the tree.  Maintaining a package involves a time commitment, even if your ebuild
you submitted to bugzilla works, or your patch works, it takes time fixing other
bugs, testing the package, checking for updates, and so on.  Sometimes there is
no one to take this resposibility on.  If you are confident there are enough users
for the package, feel free to take it to Gentoo Sunrise once the ebuild has been
removed from the tree (not before mind, their policy states you can't have
something in sunrise and the tree, so be patient).  For more information on Sunrise
please see <uri link="http://gentoo-sunrise.org">gentoo-sunrise.org</uri> and
#gentoo-sunrise on chat.freenode.net.
