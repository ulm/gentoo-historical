<description>
Proxy maintainers is a group of developers maintaining abandoned packages on behalf of Gentoo users.
</description>

<longdescription>

<p>Gentoo currently has quite a few packages that lack a maintainer. To prevent treecleaners from removing those packages,
a maintainer has to be found as soon as possible. The overall goal of this project is to act as a primary contact point
between developers and users who want to maintain abandoned packages. Users are more than welcome to contact us and express
their interest in maintaining a package assigned to 'maintainer-needed@gentoo.org'.
</p>

</longdescription>

<goals>

<p>
To enhance the user-developer cooperation in maintaining packages.

<body>
<p>
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/index.xml">Treecleaners</uri> maintain an up-to-date list of <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/maintainer-needed.xml">orphaned packages</uri>. Choose your favorite package and contact us to express your interest.
</p>
<note>
Please note that packages which have been abandoned by their upstream maintainers do not qualify as orphaned packages. We don't want to maintain dead packages and they will be removed in the near future.

<title>What it takes to be a Proxied Maintainer</title>
<section>
<title>Enthusiasm</title>
<body>
<p>
Proxy Maintainers should be interested in the packages that they are maintaining.
By becoming a Proxy Maintainer you are essentially the person in charge of that package
in Gentoo.  When users have questions regarding a package and how it works in Gentoo, you
and your Commiter will be the people that those questions are directed towards.  We would
like you to enjoy the maintaince and not feel as though it is a chore.  To that end we are
looking for enthusiastic people.
</p>

<section>
<title>Teamwork</title>
<body>
<p>
At a minimum you will be assigned one Commiter who is your partner with regards to a specific
package.  Your work will be reviewed by your Commiter for violations of Gentoo QA policy;
much of the policy is based more on common sense and less on specific rules.  If your work
does not meet QA your Commiter will notify you of where this occurs and will help you fix
the problems to ensure that you work meets guidelines and can be included in the Gentoo
package repository.  Please do not take offense to these suggestions; all criticism should
be intended as constructive criticism.

<title>Interest</title>
<body>
<p>
Similarly in the vein above, don't Proxy-Maintain a package you know very little about
unless you are dead sure you can get up to speed on it.  For many packages this is not a
big problem (many are quite small).  However for larger applications and/or libraries it
is important to have prior knowledge about the package in question.  Bugs about the package
will be directed toward you (and also your Commiter).  However as Proxy-Maintainer you are
responsible for responding to the bugs with patches/comments/etc.  Be prepared to do this.
</p>

<section>
<title>Patience</title>
<body>
<p>
Sometimes the Gentoo Developer with whom you are collaborating goes MIA.  Preferably
they will inform the Proxy-Maintainer project ahead of time (or via devaway) and we will
notify you and attempt to find a replacement Committer during their absense.  This may
take some time; please be patient with us while we find a replacement.  However don't be
afraid to prod every once in a while on the status of your Committer if they are not
responsive.
