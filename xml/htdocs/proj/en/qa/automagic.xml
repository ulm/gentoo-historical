<title>What are automagic dependencies?</title>
<body>

<p>
The so-called <e>automagic dependecies</e> are shallow dependencies of a
software recognized at build or runtime and changes the way the software works.
The name <e>automagic</e> is a pun referred to the use of GNU autotools, that
produces most of the cases of <e>automagic dependencies</e>.
</p>

<p>
Software usually have two kind of dependencies: mandatory dependencies and
optional dependencies. The first kind of dependencies are needed to use the
software (that might be a library or a program), and cannot be missing in the
system while building or running the program (depending whether they are build
or runtime dependencies). Optional dependencies are the ones that can be
disabled, usually at buildtime (but sometimes at runtime, too).
</p>

<p>
Optional dependencies are usually up to the user (or the builder) to enable or
disable, the classical example is brought by the <c>--enable-foo</c> or
<c>--with-bar</c> options at <c>./configure</c> call (those parameters are used
to enable dependencies that are off by default, but there are cases when the
dependencies are on by default so you have <c>--disable-foo</c> and
<c>--without-bar</c>).
</p>

<p>
But with build systems that tries to understand what is present in the system
they are building it, sometimes dependencies get <e>automagic</e>. This means
that the build system doesn't give the builder a way to decide if he wants
something enabled, so the dependency added, but they just enable it when they
find it. This is the wrong behaviour.
</p>

<title>Why automagic dependencies are wrong</title>

<body>

<p>
In the case of binary-based distributions, like RPM or DEB based ones,
automagic dependencies does not change anything: if the user has something
installed and is building by hand, it's usually what he wants to enable, while
if it's the maintainer, he'll just have to add a dependency over the packages
required to run the binaries he has created.
</p>

<p>
Different is for source-based distributions like Gentoo Linux (and variants).
As source-based distributions doesn't detach user and devel packages, the build
systems might find more stuff than the user required, and will try to link to
all it know about. This is the major cause of binary linking breaking after
a depclean.
</p>

<p>
To simplify, when an automagic dependency is not stated as mandatory in an
ebuild, but rather has a flag that just adds or remove the dependencies on a
given package, if this package is present in the system building the software
with automagic dependencies, but then it's removed, the software will break,
requiring to run <c>revdep-rebuild</c> to fix the linking. It's also possible
that an user really don't want some dependency enabled because he know it's
likely to break from time to time, or because he's going to create a binary
package for another machine where the dependency might not be present (or might
not work at all).
</p>

<p>
When a package has automagic dependencies there are only two things that can
be done: the first is to state the dependency as mandatory, no matter what the
users put in their USE variable, but that might mean that some support that
people don't want is always enable and its dependencies pulle din; the other
is to fix the build system to be able to disable at build time the dependency
also if it's present on the system.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time upstream developers don't really think of adding support for
disabling automagic dependencies as they don't feel them as actual problems:
they do have all of them installed, or the ones they need, and they usually
build with all of them. Luckily, most of upstream developers also don't mind
adding options to disable them if patches are provided (sometimes also without
patches, but of course it might be more welcome if already prepared patches are
sent), but that's not always the case, for example Wine's upstream don't want
to add support for enabling or disabling features in <c>./configure</c> call
as they want the software to always use as much as options as possible.

<title>Autotools</title>

<body>

<p>
Most of the automagic dependencies, like the name suggests, are due to (bad) use
of GNU autotools (<c>autoconf</c> to be exact). There are two main cases where
automagic dependencies are brought in: the first is the "lazy devs" case, where
the dependencies does not have a <c>./configure</c> parameter at all, they are
just checked with <b>AC_CHECK_LIB</b> or the <c>pkg-config</c> macro
<b>PKG_CHECK_MODULES</b>, that allows to run specific code when a library (or
a package) is present or not; the other case is the "silly argument" case, where
a <c>--disable-foo</c> or <c>--without-bar</c> parameter is actually accepted by
<c>./configure</c>, but it's not checked correctly.
</p>

<p>
The first case is actually simple to fix, it's just matter of adding a
<b>AC_ARG_WITH</b> (or <b>AC_ARG_ENABLE</b>) call and then check for the
corresponding variable before doing the test. It's useful to know that the first
parameter passed to the above macro actually names a variable that gets loaded
by <c>autoconf</c> without having to add the extra parameters for action to
execute when the parameter is present and when it's not, the variale is named
<path>$enable_foo</path> or <path>$with_bar</path>, depending on which of the
two macros are called.
</p>

<note>
For the patches to be accepted by upstream, it's usually suggested not to change
the default behaviour, when <c>./configure</c> is called without parameters; for
this reason, here will be listed two methods to make non-automagic the
dependencies, one for enabled-by-default deps and one for disabled-by-default
deps.
</note>

<pre caption="Adding an enabled-by-default check for an optional dependency">
<i>AC_ARG_WITH([foo], AS_HELP_STRING([--without-foo], [Build without foo library (default: test)]))</i>

<i>if test "x$with_foo" != "xno"; then</i>
  PKG_CHECK_MODULES([FOO], [foo >= 0.1])
<i>fi</i>
</pre>

<pre caption="Adding a disabled-by-default check for an optional dependency">
<i>AC_ARG_WITH([foo], AS_HELP_STRING([--with-foo], [Build with foo library (default: disabled)]))</i>

<i>if test "x$with_foo" == "xyes"; then</i>
  PKG_CHECK_MODULES([FOO], [foo >= 0.1])
<i>fi</i>
</pre>

<p>
When the parameter is present but it's not honoured, it might be simple as well
as complex to fix the dependency. It might just be a test that's not properly
written, so it has to be changed in something alike to the tests above, or it
might be a complete screwup in calls of <b>AC_ARG_WITH</b> macros. In those
cases, it's better to check the code carefully and contact upstream if a screw
up seems likely.
</p>

<warn>
Often (almost always when a package is using automake) automagic dependencies
are coupled with <b>AM_CONDITIONAL</b> calls. It's very important that those
calls are put <e>outside</e> the if/fi block, or <c>./configure</c> call will
bomb out.
</warn>

<p>
There's actually another way to workaround, without fixing (and patching), the
automagic dependencies generated by <b>AC_CHECK_LIB</b>, and it's by playing
around with the cache values used by <c>autoconf</c>. This method is actually
deprecated because it does not fix the issue to the roots and might create
problems if upstream changes the tests a bit using a different cache variable
name. Also, in this way fixes can't be sent upstream for integration in later
versions.

<title>Other build systems</title>

<body>

<impo>
Please expand this guide ;) Notes about other non-custom build systems such as
<c>scons</c> are welcome, if the build system has ways to define automagic
dependencies, it should have a way to fix them, too.
</impo>

<p>
Automagic dependencies can be created also with custom build systems that are
used by some software. Unfortunately, being custom, those build systems are
usually difficult to tweak, and there's no way to describe a general approach
to fix them.
