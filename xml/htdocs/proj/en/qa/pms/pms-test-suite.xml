		The PMS test suite project aims to develop and maintain a comprehensive
		test suite to check the compliance of a particular Package Manager with
		the PMS.
	</description>

	<longdescription>
		<p>
			Historically, there were many cases whenever the behavior of a
			particular Package Manager didn't follow the PMS spec. In worst
			case, this resulted in a growing number of ebuilds which relied on
			the incorrect behavior and caused trouble for users of other Package
			Managers.
		</p>

		<p>
			The PMS test suite project aims to provide a comprehensive solution
			to avoid such a mistakes in the future. It is supposed to provide a
			set of tests against various aspects of the PMS, and a means to run
			these tests using any Package Manager.
		</p>

		<p>
			The PMS test suite project has been started as a 2011 GSoC project.
			It can be found in the gentoo package tree as
			<c>app-portage/pms-test-suite</c>.
