<p>
Our developers use several different services that we need to ensure get taken
care of when they retire.
</p>

<p>
This process officially starts when Developer Relations CCes
infra-bugs@gentoo.org on the retirement bug and tells us to retire the
developer. <mail link="robbat2@gentoo.org">robbat2</mail> is the present infra
retirement processor, but this document is intended to allow other infra staff
with suitable access to retire as needed.
</p>

<p>
You must have access to the following services:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Server</th>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Access level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>woodpecker</ti>
    <ti>dev.gentoo.org</ti>
    <ti>root</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>stork</ti>
    <ti>cvs.gentoo.org</ti>
    <ti>root</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>toucan</ti>
    <ti>ldap1.gentoo.org</ti>
    <ti>shell access <b>AND</b> infra-ldapadmin.group in LDAP gentooAccess attribute</ti>

<title>Retiring Procedures</title>
<section>
<title>Retire from dev.gentoo.org</title>
<body>

<p>
The first step is to remove a developer from our shell box. Infrastructure has
created a shell script that should take care of all the tasks. Login as
<b>root</b> to dev.gentoo.org and run the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Removal from dev.gentoo.org">
# <i>/root/scripts/retire-dev <comment>username</comment></i>
</pre>

<p>
This script will do the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the user from all local groups</li>
  <li>Remove the user from all mail aliases</li>
  <li>
    If they have a mail forward, copy it to the <path>retired-devs</path> alias
    directory
  </li>
  <li>
    If they don't have a mail forward, create a mbox that their mail will go to
    for 30 days in case they need something.
  </li>
  <li>Move their home directory to <path>/home/RETIRED/username</path></li>
  <li>Index the contents of their home directory with permission details</li>
  <li>Change the ownership of their homedir to <b>root</b></li>
  <li>Tar up their homedir</li>
  <li>Remove the homedir while leaving the tarball of homedir</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's what it will look like:
</p>

<pre caption="Retiring a user on dev.gentoo.org">
# <i>/root/scripts/retire-dev <comment>username</comment></i>
Stop all processing belonging to <comment>username</comment>
Removing <comment>username</comment> from groups (<comment>exp_x86,bsd</comment>) via gpasswd
Removing <comment>username</comment> from aliases
  Removing from /var/mail/alias/misc/<comment>net-irc</comment>
  Removing from /var/mail/alias/misc/<comment>net-mail</comment>
Forward not found, redirecting mail to /home/RETIRED/mail-backup/<comment>username</comment>.saved
Moving home directory from /home/<comment>username</comment> to /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>
Indexing old content of /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>
Changing ownership to root on /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>/*
Tar'ing up /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>
Removing /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>

 ** Remember to run these commands on ldap1: **
  perl_ldap -b user -E gentooAccess <comment>username</comment>
  perl_ldap -b user -M gentooStatus retired <comment>username</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Since our shell box uses LDAP, actual user deletion will happen on the LDAP
server. We cannot just lock the user in LDAP, as OpenSSH may still consult the
authorized_keys file, hence the retiring of the home directory as well.
</p>

<section>
<title>Retire from cvs.gentoo.org</title>
<body>

<p>
Retiring a developer from the CVS server works the same way as the shell
retirement process (stopping proceses, and removing from groups). The only
difference is that the script only moves the developer's home directory to the
<path>RETIRED</path> folder. Log into cvs.gentoo.org and run the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Removal from cvs.gentoo.org">
# <i>/root/scripts/retire-dev <comment>username</comment></i>
Moving homedir from /home/<comment>username</comment> to /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>
Changing ownership to root on /home/RETIRED/<comment>username</comment>/
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Retire in LDAP</title>
<body>

<p>
In order to remove the user totally from our system, you need to login to our
primary LDAP server (ldap1.gentoo.org). You cannot retire a developer from any
other box. <mail link="ramereth@gentoo.org">ramereth</mail> created a script that
does the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removes any attribute with <c>gentooAccess</c></li>
  <li>Sets the developer's <c>gentooStatus</c> to <c>retired</c></li>
  <li>Setting the gentooRetire attribute.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently, this script resides in a home directory on ldap1.gentoo.org:
<path>/home/robbat2/scripts/retire-dev-ldap</path>. Copy this script to your
homedir and use it, or run it directly. This is the second version of the
script, that detects additional gentooAccess attributes correctly.
</p>

<pre caption="Retire developer in LDAP">
$ <i>/home/robbat2/scripts/retire-dev-ldap <comment>username</comment></i>
Enter LDAP Password:
replace gentooStatus:
    retired
delete gentooAccess:
    cvs.gentoo.org
    dev.gentoo.org
    stork.gentoo.org
modifying entry "uid=<comment>username</comment>,ou=devs,dc=gentoo,dc=org"

WARNING, extra gentooAccess detected: stork.gentoo.org
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Special cases: other machine access</title>
<body>

<p>
Now you need to check every other Gentoo machine that the developer previously
had local-account access to, such as any other *.gentoo.org boxes, or the
various arch team machines like *.amd64.gentoo.org. You need to disable any
local accounts that still exist. If the box is connected to LDAP, cleaning up
the home directory is nice, but not required.
</p>

<note>
Infra: do we have a nice retirement script for this? This would of course
require that we track who has access to which machines better. ;-)
</note>

<section>
<title>Retire from mailing lists</title>
<body>

<impo>
Retiring developers are responsible for re-subscribing to any lists that they
are still interested in.
</impo>

<p>
Now we need to remove the developer from all our mailing lists so that we don't
have to deal with extra mail and the bounce to timeout. The following script on
our mailserver will comb through the lists and remove the email address from
that list properly. It will check for regular subscribers, digest subscribers
and nomail subscribers.
</p>


<pre caption="Unsubscribe the email address from all mailing lists">
# <i>/usr/local/sbin/unsub-global.sh <comment>username</comment>@gentoo.org</i>
Removing <comment>username</comment>@gentoo.org from gentoo-core
Removing <comment>username</comment>@gentoo.org from gentoo-dev
Removing <comment>username</comment>@gentoo.org from gentoo-gwn
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Retire Bugzilla account</title>
<body>

<impo>
Retiring developers must open a new Bugzilla account with their user email
address if they wish to continue using Bugzilla. If they are interested in mail
to the old account, they should explicitly configure watches for every address
and alias that they are interested in.<br/> The reasoning behind this is
threefold: allow future searches to find work by a given developer after he has
retired, without having to know what his email address was renamed to; protect
old private bugs; preserve the assignee information on old closed bugs.
</impo>

<p>
Now we need to retire and disable their Bugzilla account. Please do the
following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Locate the account using the <b>Users</b> administrative search. If they
    have renamed their account already, you may need to search very hard to find
    them (Bugzilla does not provide a way to search by real name).
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the disabled text to say: "Retired on 12-08-2005 as per retirement bug
    #12345." Retiring developers are responsible for creating a new bugzilla
    account, and configuring watches for all bugzilla accounts that they are
    interested in.
  </li>
  <li>Append <b>(RETIRED)</b> to the real name field</li>
  <li>Remove them from any Bugzilla groups they may have been added to</li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Update forums account</title>
<body>

<p>
Contact any forums administrator, or CC their Bugzilla account (<mail
link="forum-mods@gentoo.org">forum-mods@gentoo.org</mail>) on the bug.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Retire from Planet/Universe</title>
<body>

<p>
Finally, in order to remove the developer's blog from Gentoo Planet and Gentoo
Universe, you can either CC <mail
link="planet.gentoo.org">planet@gentoo.org</mail> on the retirement bug, or
login to planet.gentoo.org and change
<path>/var/www/planet.gentoo.org/base/planet/configs/*.ini</path>.
</p>
<note>Infra: Contact beandog about automating it better.</note>
