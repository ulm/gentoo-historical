<b>Q:</b>  Can I complie and/or install &lt;some program&gt; on dev.gentoo.org?  It would make my life much easier.
</p>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  Generally, no.  The primary purpose of dev.gentoo.org is to provide email functionality and facilitate file transfers between developers.  It is <b>not</b> intended to be a general shell access type server. Where there is a program that a <b>significant</b> number of Gentoo developers may benefit from by having it installed, we will certainly look at adding it.  <c>procmail</c> is a perfect example of just such a program.  If you feel there is a program that should be added, please contact klieber.

<p>
Specifically, we do not install, support or provide IRC bouncers.
