<title>Mirror Wrangling</title>
<section>
<title>Preparing and testing mirrors</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>1.</b> New mirrors should file a file <uri
	link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mirrors">bug</uri> under
the "Mirrors" product, "New Server" component. If a request comes in via email,
ask them to file the request on Bugzilla.
</p>

<p>
This will help us test out the mirror using our <b>G</b>entoo <b>A</b>utomated
<b>R</b>sync <b>D</b>istfiles checker script, or GARD for short.
</p>

<p>
<b>2.</b> Ask for the following information on the bug, if not provided
already:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Official mirror name (preferably not your hostname, but the name of your
    organization)
  </li>
  <li>
    Mirror type: distfiles/releases, gentoo-portage. NOTE: gentoo-portage is
    always rsync <e>only</e>. Some mirrors may have rsync for distfiles as well.
    Do not be confused by the difference!
  </li>
  <li>
    URLs: full protocol <e>and</e> path for release/distfile mirrors, hostname
    or IP for gentoo-portage mirrors
  </li>
  <li>Hardware specifications</li>
  <li>
    Bandwidth specifications (transfer speed, eg 100Mbit, and any limits you
    may have)
  </li>
  <li>Location</li>
  <li>Intended concurrent users (for each protocol, mirror type)</li>
  <li>
    Admin contact name and email address (This address should be registered in
    bugzilla so we can CC you to any bug reports)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Modify the summary to have the type of mirror and the city as well as
country if possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>4.</b> Build a testing string for GARD. The <c>;</c> <c>:</c> and <c>|</c>
are important, make sure they're where they're supposed to be:
</p>

<pre caption="String format for GARD">
due:YYYY/MM/DD;dist:http://URL|ftp://URL|rsync://URL (distfiles);portage:FQDN or IP
</pre>

<p>
Here are some string samples:
</p>

<pre caption="Server strings">
<comment>(Everything mirror: distfiles + gentoo-portage)</comment>
due:2009/01/01;dist:http://mirror.gentoo.org/gentoo/|ftp://mirror.gentoo.org/gentoo/|rsync://mirror.gentoo.org/gentoo/;portage:mirror.gentoo.org

<comment>(gentoo-portage mirror only)</comment>
due:2009/01/01;dist:||;portage:mirror.gentoo.org

<comment>(http distfiles mirror only)</comment>
due:2009/01/01;dist:http://mirror.gentoo.org/gentoo/||;portage:
</pre>

<p>
<b>5.</b> Inform the mirror of testing policies, tell them the due date (when
testing will be completed) and give them the following links to make sure their
mirror(s) have been setup correctly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distfiles: <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/source_mirrors.xml</uri></li>
  <li>gentoo-portage: <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/rsync.xml</uri></li>
</ul>

<p>
Our policy right now for testing duration is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    New distfiles/gentoo-portage mirrors: 2 weeks from date of infra accepting
    the bug
  </li>
  <li>
    Returning distfiles/gentoo-portage mirrors: Same hardware/IP - 1 week.
    Different hardware/IP - 2 weeks
  </li>
  <li>
    Problematic mirrors: 1 week to fix the issue, else they're removed from
    rotation unless we're provided with valid reasons by the admins.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rsync mirrors in any continental rotation on DNS with issues should be
    removed immediately from those until the issue is resolved. For example,
    <path>rsync.namerica.gentoo.org</path>,
    <path>rsync.europe.gentoo.org</path>. You can leave the mirror in its
    country's rotation.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>6.</b> Put the testing string in the Status whiteboard of the bug and mark
the bug as IN_PROGRESS. These steps are important for GARD to start checking
the mirror.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.</b> Review the GARD output for issues daily.
</p>

<p>
<b>8.</b> Report problems back to the mirror ASAP.
</p>

<p>
<b>9.</b> If there are no problems, try to give a (good) report at the halfway
point of the period.
</p>

<p>
<b>10.</b> Give a final good at the end of the testing period, if everything is
good.
</p>

<p>
Now the mirror is ready to be added officially.

<chapter>
<title>Adding Mirrors</title>
<section>
<title>For distfiles mirrors</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>1.</b> Add the mirror to CVS
<path>gentoo/xml/htdocs/main/en/mirrors3.xml</path> (check the format of the
doc, follow the same).
</p>

<p>
<b>2.</b> Send the distfiles password email to the new mirror admins, CC
<mail>mirror-admin@gentoo.org</mail> (mirror admins have the password, it is not
public).
</p>
<pre caption="Example email">Hi,
We're glad to have you as our newest source mirror, welcome aboard!

Use this information to sync with our private mirror every 4 hours from
Midnight local time. This is for mirror admins only, please do not share
this information.

----------------------------------------
rsync module: masterdistfiles-{eu,us}.gentoo.org::gentoo
username: $insert_here
password: $insert_here

To make this scriptable, we recommend placing the password in a file and
then using the --password-file option with rsync.  The file must not be
accessible by others (i.e. chmod 640) or rsync will complain.  So, as an
example, placing the password into '~/distfile_passwd', you would use an
rsync command like the following:

rsync -rlptDq --delete -H --password-file=~/distfile_passwd \
$username@masterdistfiles-{eu,us}..gentoo.org::gentoo /your/local/path/goes/here

Please note that we have received several reports of problems when using
the -z (compress) option of rsync.  Thus, please DO NOT use this option
when syncing against this mirror.
---------------------------------------

Please also make sure you are subscribed to gentoo-mirrors@gentoo.org as
we often send out administrative notices and policy changes via this
list.

Thanks for helping Gentoo!

Cheers,
$name</pre>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Add the mirror/admin-email to <uri
link="https://infrawiki.gentoo.org/mirrorcontact">the infra wiki</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<b>4.</b> Put in the following comment and close the bug:
</p>

<p>
<e>Thanks for helping out Gentoo. I have added your mirror to our list at
http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml. Please start syncing from
masterdistfiles.gentoo.org as the email I have sent to you instructs. We would
like you to subscribe to the gentoo-mirrors Mailing List by sending an email to
gentoo-mirrors+subscribe@lists.gentoo.org, as we send out notifications of
updates, releases, and changes in policy to the mirrors. Please also monitor
http://mirrorstats.gentoo.org as this application is used to keep track of the
up-to-date nature of our mirrors. Thanks for the hardware and bandwidth!</e>

<title>For gentoo-portage mirrors</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>1.</b> Add the IP to <path>osprey.gentoo.org</path>, at
<path>/home/gmirror/rsync-hosts-allow/hosts.allow.master</path>. Follow the
format, re-use existing numbers for a country before adding new ones.
</p>
<pre caption="Adding an IP to the ACL">
$ <i>ssh osprey.gentoo.org</i>
$ <i>cd /home/gmirror/rsync-hosts-allow</i>
$ <i>${EDITOR} hosts.allow.master</i>
$ <i>git commit hosts.allow.master</i>
</pre>

<p>
<b>2.</b> To add a new country, just make sure it isn't already there, then
create one.
</p>

<note>
If you've added a new country to this file, chances are countryTLD.gentoo.org
doesn't exist, check FIRST and if nothing, create one using the "Add A Domain
Page". Email <mail>infra@gentoo.org</mail> (CC
<mail>mirror-admin@gentoo.org</mail>) to notify them of the new sub-domain.
</note>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Add the IP into the country (and if needed, continent) DNS rotation(s)
in UltraDNS. For example, a new mirror in the US would be
<path>rsync(number).us.gentoo.org</path>, so you will add the new IP:
</p>

<pre caption="Managing DNS rotation">
rsync(number).us.gentoo.org - TTL - 86400

<comment>(US/Country rotation)</comment>
rsync.us.gentoo.org - TTL - 1800

<comment>(Continental rotation)</comment>
rsync.namerica.gentoo.org - TTL - 1800
</pre>

<note>
TTLs for rotations are obviously lower, so that we can modify them quickly if
needed.
</note>

<p>
<b>4.</b> Add the mirror to CVS
<path>gentoo/xml/htdocs/main/en/mirrors-rsync-data.xml</path> (check the format
of the doc, follow the same).
</p>

<p>
<b>5.</b> Add the mirror/admin-email to <uri
link="https://infrawiki.gentoo.org/mirrorcontact">the infra wiki</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<b>6.</b> Put in the following comment (modify as needed) and close the bug:
</p>

<p>
<e>Thanks for helping out Gentoo. I have added the IP you specified in the bug
to our access database, please start syncing to masterportage.gentoo.org per our
rsync document at http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/rsync.xml. We would like you to
subscribe to the gentoo-mirrors Mailing List by sending an email to
gentoo-mirrors+subscribe@lists.gentoo.org, as we send our notifications of
updates, releases, and changes in policy to the mirrors. Once again, thanks for
the hardware and bandwidth! Please also monitor
http://mirrorstats.gentoo.org/rsync as this application is used to keep track of
the up-to-date nature of our mirrors. You are mirror
rsync(number).$country.gentoo.org in the rsync.$country.gentoo.org rotation and
have been added to the rsync.$continent.gentoo.org rotation as well.</e>

</p>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Put in the following comment and close the bug:
</p>

<p>
<e>Removed $server_name from mirrors listings. Thanks for the hardware and
bandwidth donation, your services helped many Gentoo Users. (You have no more
obligation to monitor the gentoo-mirrors mailing list.)</e>
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>For gentoo-portage mirrors</title>
<body>

<p>
<b>1.</b> Remove the IP from <path>osprey.gentoo.org</path>, at
<path>/home/gmirror/rsync-hosts-allow/hosts.allow.master</path>. Leave the
existing rsyncX.$CC comment so that it is known that it should be reused.
</p>
<pre caption="Removing an IP to the ACL">
$ <i>ssh osprey.gentoo.org</i>
$ <i>cd /home/gmirror/rsync-hosts-allow</i>
$ <i>${EDITOR} hosts.allow.master</i>
$ <i>git commit hosts.allow.master</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you are removing the last mirror in a rsync.$CC rotation, you should talk to
infra and make sure there is a solution so users do not try to sync to an dead
address.
</note>

<p>
<b>2.</b> Remove the IP from the country DNS rotation(s) in UltraDNS.
</p>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Remove the mirror from CVS
<path>gentoo/xml/htdocs/main/en/mirrors-rsync-data.xml</path> (check the format
of the doc, follow the same).
</p>

<p>
<b>4.</b> Put in the following comment (modify as needed) and close the bug:
</p>

<p>
<e>Removed $server_name from ACLs, removed from DNS. Thanks for the hardware and
bandwidth donation, your services helped many Gentoo Users. (You have no more
obligation to monitor the gentoo-mirrors mailing list.)</e>
