<longname>Gentoo Infrastructure</longname>
<date>October 5, 2005</date>

<description>
The infrastructure project describes the infrastructure that Gentoo uses, how 
the infrastructure is administrated, who is in charge of what infrastructure and
more infrastructure-related items.
</description>

<longdescription>

<p>
The Gentoo Infrastructure project is comprised of several smaller projects that,
as a whole, provide the resources, services and technology necessary to support
the Gentoo Linux project.  The project is responsible for the security, 
availability and integrity of the data stored on the Gentoo Linux servers.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo Infrastructure team is made up of a group of people with a variety 
of backgrounds, from traditional system and network administration, to deep 
security expertise.  These members work together to ensure all necessary 
resources are available to keep the Gentoo Linux project running and available.
