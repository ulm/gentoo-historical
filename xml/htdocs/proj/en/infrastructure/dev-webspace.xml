<title>Use and Policy</title>

<p>
Within your devspace on woodpecker (dev.gentoo.org) you may create a <path>public_html</path>
directory accessible at: <path>http://dev.gentoo.org/~username</path>.
You may store any Gentoo related files in this space such as project
documentation, ebuilds/packages you are testing, etc... Please note that you
should not store distfiles for public distribution in this space only for
distribution to other developers/testers. Packages for public distribution
should be put on the distfiles mirror.
</p>

<p>
Your dev space is for Gentoo related files. You may not host files for your
company/home business, pornography or any file that is considered illegal in
the United States (woodpecker is located in the USA). Pages in your public_html
folder are viewable by the world and their contents should follow the same
rules. You may not use your dev space to make money in any way. This includes
banner swapping, auctions (or hosting images for your auctions) or google ads.
As usual, common sense should apply.
</p>

<p>
If any files in your space are found to be harmful towards other developers or
users on the box or pose a risk to the Gentoo project (such as illegal
torrents, pornography, etc...), Gentoo Infrastructure will suspend your account
which will only be unlocked after investigation from Gentoo Developer Relations.
In most cases, your developership will be suspended if such files are found. If
you are unsure of the impact a file may have on another developer or Gentoo in
general please ask your Mentor/Manager to review it for you.

<title>Uploading Files</title>
<body>

<p>
If your recruiter didn't set up the public_html directory for you go ahead and
do it yourself like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Create public_html">
username@homebox ~$ <i>ssh username@dev.gentoo.org</i>
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa':<comment>(Enter your passphrase)</comment>

username@woodpecker home$ <i>cd ~username</i>
username@woodpecker ~$ <i>mkdir public_html</i>
username@woodpecker ~$ <i>chmod -R 755 public_html</i>
</pre>

<p>
The Infrastructure Project does not make backups of developer files. You are
responsible for making backups of any and all files contained in your developer
space. I suggest creating a mirror on your local box: ~/devspace.
</p>

<p>
Now copy your files using <c>scp</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Secure Copy">
username@homebox devspace$ <i>scp index.htm username@dev.gentoo.org:~/public_html</i>
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa':<comment>(Enter you passphrase)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
For more information on using scp read the man page or visit
