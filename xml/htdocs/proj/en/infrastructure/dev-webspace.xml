<p>
Within your devspace on toucan you may create a <path>public_html</path>
directory accessible at: <path>http://dev.gentoo.org/~username</path>.
You may store any Gentoo related files in this space such as project
documentation, ebuilds/packages you are testing, etc... Please note that you
should not store distfiles for public distribution in this space only for
distribution to other developers/testers. Packages for public distribution
should be put on the distfiles mirror.
</p>

<p>
If any files in your space are found to be harmful towards other developers or
users on the box or pose a risk to the Gentoo project (such as illegal
.torrents), Gentoo Infrastructure will suspend your account which will only be
unlocked after investigation from Gentoo Developer Relations. In most cases,
your developership will be suspended if such files are found. If you are unsure
of the impact a file may have on another developer or Gentoo in general please
ask your Mentor/Manager to review it for you. As with all things Gentoo use your
common sense and keep the security of the box in mind at all times.

<title>Uploading Files</title>
<body>

<p>
If your recruiter didn't set up the public_html directory for you go ahead and
do it yourself like this:
</p>

<pre caption="Create public_html">
username@homebox ~$ <i>ssh username@dev.gentoo.org</i>
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa':<comment>(Enter your passphrase)</comment>

username@toucan home$ <i>cd ~username</i>
username@toucan ~$ <i>mkdir public_html</i>
username@toucan ~$ <i>chmod -R 755 public_html</i>
</pre>

<p>
The Infrastructure Project does not make backups of developer files. You are
responsible for making backups of any and all files contained in your developer
space. I suggest creating a mirror on your local box: ~/devspace.
</p>

<p>
Now copy your files using <c>scp</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Secure Copy">
username@homebox devspace$ <i>scp index.htm username@dev.gentoo.org:~/public_html</i>
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa':<comment>(Enter you passphrase)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
For more information on using scp read the man page or visit
