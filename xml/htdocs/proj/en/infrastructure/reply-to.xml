<p>
This document is written on request of many Gentoo developers to cover how to
modify the Reply-To header in an email for consistency across all of the Gentoo
mailing lists. For reasons not mentioned here, there is an inconsistency between
the <c>gentoo-core</c> private mailing list, and the rest of the Gentoo mailing
lists.

<title>Removing Reply-To</title>
<body>

<p>
Users who have a MUA that supports a Reply-To-List function will likely want to
remove the munged Reply-To headers. This allows them to use their mail client
how it was intended, with the Reply button replying to the Author. If your mail
client has a Reply-To-List function, you can use the following recipe snippet
in your .procmailrc file to remove the Reply-To headers.
</p>

<pre caption="Remove Reply-To header">
# This removes those Reply-To: headers
:0 fhw
* ^List-Id:.*gentoo.org.
| formail -I "Reply-To:"
</pre>

<p>
This scans the message headers for any Gentoo list and removes any Reply-To
header that it finds.

<title>Adding Reply-To</title>
<body>

<p>
Some of the most popular mail clients in use do not support a Reply-To-List
function. This causes problems for the users of these clients and has resulted
in Reply-To munging being used to reduce complexity for these users. Since
only the <c>gentoo-core</c> mailing list does not use Reply-To munging, the
following rule only touches that list.
</p>

<pre caption="Add Reply-To header">
# This adds a Reply-To: header
:0 fhw
* ^List-Id:.*gentoo-core\.gentoo\.org
|formail -I "Reply-To: gentoo-core@lists.gentoo.org"
</pre>

<p>
This scans for the <c>gentoo-core</c> list and adds a Reply-To header pointing
to the list.
