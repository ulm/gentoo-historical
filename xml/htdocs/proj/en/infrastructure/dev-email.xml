<chapter>
<title>Gentoo Developer E-mail Possibilities</title>
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>
<p>
This document describes the various options for checking your gentoo.org email address.
You can opt for having the e-mails forwarded to a specific e-mail
address, or let them stay on the dev.gentoo.org server to which you can
connect using your favorite e-mail client with pop3s or imaps (the
secure implementations of POP3 and IMAP respectively).
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Forwarding E-mails</title>
<body>
<p>
If you want to have your e-mails forwarded to another e-mail address, you
should log on to dev.gentoo.org and put the e-mail address in 
<path>~/.forward</path>. Logging on to dev.gentoo.org is similar to
cvs.gentoo.org: you'll be using the same keys.
</p>
<pre caption = "Forwarding e-mails to another e-mail address">
$ <i>ssh -l username dev.gentoo.org</i>
username@emu username $ <i>echo new.e-mail@address.com &gt; ~/.forward</i>
username@emu username $ <i>exit</i>
</pre>
<note>
Old(er) developers who want to use this situation don't have to do
anything. We have already created all <path>~/.forward</path>'s with
their current e-mail address.
</note>
<p>
If you at some point want to change the e-mail address to which the
e-mails should be forwarded, change the content of the
<path>~/.forward</path> file to the new e-mail address.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Using the mailbox on dev.gentoo.org</title>
<body>
<p>
If you want to use the mailbox on dev.gentoo.org, you must make sure
that there is no <path>.forward</path> in your home directory. Doing this
requires access to dev.gentoo.org (duh). Accessing dev.gentoo.org is no
different than accessing cvs.gentoo.org: you'll be using the same keys.
</p>
<pre caption = "Removing ~/.forward">
$ <i>ssh -l username dev.gentoo.org rm ~/.forward</i>
</pre>
<p>
There are some things you must know about your mailbox on
dev.gentoo.org:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a <e>quota</e> on the amount of data you can store on
dev.gentoo.org. This is currently 100 Mb so the chance that e-mails are
lost because you exceeded the quota are slim. However, if you plan on
taking a vacation and you think that the quota can be exceeded during
your vacation, have the e-mails forwarded to another e-mail address
where you have no such quota.</li>
<li>You can only access it using pop3s or imaps (see the following
chapter).</li>
<li>There are some local e-mail clients installed on
dev.gentoo.org (<c>mutt</c> and <c>pine</c> to be exact). Only use those
if you know how to use them :)</li>
<li>The password to access the mailbox is the same password you can set
on dev.gentoo.org using <c>passwd</c>.</li>
</ul>
</body>

<chapter>
<title>Using dev.gentoo.org for your e-mails</title>
<section>
<title>Accessing dev.gentoo.org using pop3s</title>
<body>
<p>
pop3s is the secure variant of POP3, the Post Office Protocol version 3.
POP3 is a pull-protocol, meaning that e-mails are pulled from the server
to your local disk. 
</p>
<p>
To set up your favorite e-mail client for pop3s, use the following
settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><e>POP3 server</e>: dev.gentoo.org</li>
<li><e>Use SSL</e>: yes</li>
<li><e>Account</e>: your username</li>
<li><e>Password</e>: your dev.gentoo.org password</li>
</ul>
<warn>
POP3 without SSL is <e>not</e> supported! It is insecure because it
transmits the password in plain tekst, which is a Bad Thing (TM).
</warn>
<note>
The dev.gentoo.org password is the same as the one used on
cvs.gentoo.org (which is now SSH-key only). If you don't know your
password anymore, ask <mail
link="klieber@gentoo.org">klieber</mail>, <mail
link="sj7trunks@gentoo.org">sj7trunks</mail> or <mail
link="peitolm@gentoo.org">peitolm</mail> to reset your password).
</note>
<p>
For instance, if you are using <c>fetchmail</c> to fetch your e-mails,
your <path>.fetchmailrc</path> should read something like this:
</p>
<pre caption = "fetchmailrc">
poll dev.gentoo.org proto pop3 
    user <i>username</i> pass <i>password</i> nokeep ssl
</pre>
<p>
If you are using <c>sylpheed</c> for your e-mails, create a new account
and make sure that the <e>Receive</e> tab uses POP3 and the <e>SSL</e>
tab has the <e>Use SSL for POP3 connection</e> selected.
</p>
<p>
If you are using <c>mutt</c>, you're smart enough to figure this one out
yourself.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Accessing dev.gentoo.org using imaps</title>
<body>
<p>
imaps is the secure variant of IMAP, the Internet Message Acces Protocol
version 4. IMAP is a push-protocol, meaning that e-mails stay on the 
remote server and you can manage seperate mailboxes on that server. 
</p>
<p>
To set up your favorite e-mail client for imaps, use the following
settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><e>IMAP server</e>: dev.gentoo.org</li>
<li><e>Use SSL</e>: yes</li>
<li><e>Account</e>: your username</li>
<li><e>Password</e>: your dev.gentoo.org password</li>
</ul>
<warn>
IMAP without SSL is <e>not</e> supported! It is insecure because it
uses static authentication, which is a Bad Thing (TM).
</warn>
<note>
The dev.gentoo.org password is the same as the one used on
cvs.gentoo.org (which is now SSH-key only). If you don't know your
password anymore, ask <mail
link="klieber@gentoo.org">klieber</mail>, <mail
link="sj7trunks@gentoo.org">sj7trunks</mail> or <mail
link="peitolm@gentoo.org">peitolm</mail> to reset your password).
</note>
<p>
For instance, if you are using <c>fetchmail</c> to fetch your e-mails,
your <path>.fetchmailrc</path> should read something like this:
</p>
<pre caption = "fetchmailrc">
poll dev.gentoo.org proto imap
    user <i>username</i> pass <i>password</i> nokeep ssl
</pre>
<p>
If you are using <c>mutt</c>, you're smart enough to figure this one out
yourself.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Using dev.gentoo.org as a mail relay server</title>
<body>
<warn>
Do <e>not</e> do this unless absolutely necessary. Please use your ISPs
relay server whenever possible. 
</warn>
<p>
If you need a relay-server desperately and have no other means of
sending e-mails, you can use dev.gentoo.org as a relayserver. To do
this, you must first provide it with a password (not your dev.gentoo.org
password!). 
</p>
<pre caption = "Setting a password for auth-smtp">
$ <i>ssh -l username dev.gentoo.org</i>
username@emu username $ <i>echo "ChosenPassword" > ~/.asmtppasswd</i>
username@emu username $ <i>chmod 0740 ~/.asmtppasswd</i>
username@emu username $ <i>chmod o+x ~/</i>
username@emu username $ <i>exit</i>
</pre>
<impo>Please do <b>not</b> use your regular login password for your asmtp password.  Instead, choose a random password and use that or <c>emerge makepasswd</c> and run <c>makepasswd --chars=8</c> to have it select one for you</impo>
<note>~/.asmtppasswd must be owned by the 'mail' group.  This should be the default setting.  If you notice, however, that your ~/.asmtppasswd file is group-owned by a different group, please contact one of the infrastructure sysadmins to fix it.</note>
<p>
Now setup your e-mail client to use dev.gentoo.org as the SMTP server.
Select <e>yes</e> when asked if the server uses authentication. If you
get the choice, select <e>cram-md5</e> as the hash-method. Use your
username and the provided password from above for authentication.

<chapter>
<title>Frequently Asked and/or Anticipated Questions</title>
<section>
<title>What happens when dev.gentoo.org goes down?</title>
<body>
<p>
When dev.gentoo.org goes down, e-mails
will stay in the mailqueue on mail.gentoo.org and will be delivered
whenever dev.gentoo.org is up again.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Can I use procmail on dev.gentoo.org?</title>
<body>
<p>
Yes you can. 
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Can I use SpamAssassin on dev.gentoo.org?</title>
<body>
<p>
Yes you can. 
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Why don't you set up a system-wide (spam|virus) filter?</title>
<body>
<p>
Spam and virus filtering is not 100% accurate and there are risks of losing legitimate email when using these tools.
Consequently, the infrastructure team makes the necessary tools available to the developers to use if they so choose.
</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Are my e-mails or the contents of my home directory backed up 
regularly?</title>
<body>
<p>
No, it's the responsibility of the individual to back up their own 
important files and mail.
