the MySQL RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) for Gentoo Linux.

<b>What we do, and who we are</b>
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo MySQL Team looks after the packages for the MySQL RDBMS.
MySQL is by far the most important and popular RDBMS for
web-based applications, and is the 'M' in the LAMP stack.
</p>

<p>
We're also onhand to provide information and support on MySQL to other Gentoo 
developers.
</p>

</longdescription>

<goals><p>
Our goal is to ensure that Gentoo provides the best environment possible for 
developing and running software based on MySQL.

<p>
The best way to reach us is on IRC in the <uri
link="irc://freenode/gentoo-db">#gentoo-db</uri> channel on irc.freenode.net.
Please feel free to stop by to talk about MySQL on Gentoo. We welcome any
suggestions for improvement.

<title>Participating</title>

<p>
The best way to get involved with what we do is to hang out in #gentoo-db.
There are always things to be done (and exciting new ideas to turn into
reality), and we're always looking for new ways to make Gentoo the first
choice for developers working with MySQL, and for system administrators
running it.
