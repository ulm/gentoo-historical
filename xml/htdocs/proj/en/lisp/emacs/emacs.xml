<title>What is Emacs?</title>
<body>

<p> 
<uri link="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</uri> is the
extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.
Large parts are written in the Lisp dialect Emacs Lisp, with which
extensions can be easily developed.  Apart from its editing features,
GNU Emacs provides a whole environment to manage your system, mail,
IRC chats and texts (be it correspondence or programming).

<section id="location">
<title>Locations of files</title>
<body>
<p>
The following files are installed in different locations or under a
different name (as compared to vanilla GNU Emacs):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emacs executable: <path>/usr/bin/emacs-<e>suffix</e></path>,
      where <e>suffix</e> is normally equal to the Emacs major version</li>
  <li>Auxiliary programs (e.g., <path>ctags</path>):
      <path>/usr/bin/ctags-emacs-<e>suffix</e></path></li>
  <li>Man pages are named accordingly</li>
  <li>Info files of Emacs are installed in directory
      <path>/usr/share/info/emacs-<e>suffix</e>/</path></li>
</ul>

<p>
  The programs are symlinked to their original names by the Emacs
  <uri link="#eselect">eselect module</uri>, apart from <path>ctags</path>
  and <path>etags</path> which have their own modules.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>USE flags</title>
<body>
<p>
Emacs has many USE flags, most are easy to understand what they are
good for, others have some hidden "features" one should know about.
The slot for version 18 has no USE flags at all, so if nothing else is
noted, version 21 onwards is described.

<title>Packages</title>
<section id="need_emacs">
<title>Depending on a specific Emacs version</title>
<body>
<note>
The documentation of the functions provided is to be found in the
<uri link="#eclasses">eclasses</uri> itself.
</note>
<p>
A minimum version of GNU Emacs required by a package can be specified
by assigning <c>NEED_EMACS=<e>version_number</e></c> before inheriting
<path>elisp.eclass</path>.  The given version number must be available
as an ebuild in <path>virtual/emacs</path>.  Without such an
assignment, the package will by default depend on
<path>&gt;=virtual/emacs-21</path>.  Packages that have optional
support for GNU Emacs (via USE flags) can check for a minimum
version of GNU Emacs at build time with the
<path>elisp-need-emacs()</path> function.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>The site-lisp directory and package loading</title>
<body>
<p>
The regular location for Emacs lisp packages in Gentoo
is <path>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/<e>package</e>/</path>.  All Elisp
files (<path>.el</path>) and compiled Elisp files (<path>.elc</path>)
should go there.
</p>
<p>
Emacs packages normally need to be activated or loaded when a certain
condition is met (like c-mode for C source files).
</p>
<p>
In Gentoo every package has a site initialisation file that holds
the needed commands.  The file is located in <c>${FILESDIR}</c> and
starts with a two-digit number, followed by the package name
and <path>-gentoo</path>.  The <c>elisp-install()</c> function puts
this file in the directory
<path>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo.d/</path>.
</p>
<p>
When calling <c>elisp-site-regen()</c> in an ebuild, the global site
file <path>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo.el</path> is
regenerated, which holds the contents of all individual site init
files in one.  They are read in alphabetical order, so the numbers
determine which comes first, the lowest is to be found at the
beginning.  That means: Packages depending on each other need to have rising
order for site initialisation, too.
</p>

<p>
  Formerly, all those initialisations were directly added to
  <path>site-start.el</path>, which is executed at Emacs start-up.
  Today there is another level of indirection, i.e. initialisations
  are in <path>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-gentoo.el</path> which
  can either be loaded from <path>/etc/emacs/site-start.el</path>
  (the default), or it can be individually loaded from users'
  <path>~/.emacs</path> files by adding a line like:
</p>
<p>
  <c>(require 'site-gentoo)</c>
</p>
<p>
  Historically site-init files were read from the
  <path>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/</path> directory, which is still
  supported by the eclasses, but a remerge/update will put them in the
  <path>site-gentoo.d/</path> subdirectory.
  Package <path>app-admin/emacs-updater</path> installs a script that
  checks for needed rebuilds, called <path>emacs-updater</path>.
</p>

<impo>
Site initialisation means that the package should be ready for use,
but not that the package should be imposed on all users by loading
or even starting it at Emacs startup time. (Think of systems with
multiple users.)
A <c>load</c> command for site initialisations is only acceptable for
a few packages.  If used, it always loads the whole package and makes
Emacs start-up really slow, so the autoload mechanism is the preferred
way.  The <path>elisp-common</path> eclass has functions to generate
an autoload file if none is shipped with the package but the
functionality is available in the source nonetheless.  For more
information about the mechanism see the
<uri link="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Autoload.html#Autoload">
Elisp manual</uri>.  Also manual keybindings directly in the site-file
are discouraged to not disturb the user as he could have bound exactly
that keys himself.  Keep pollution low but provide sane default settings
out of the box so even a novice can start working fast.
</impo>
</body>
</section>

<section id="eclasses">
<title>Eclasses</title>
<body>
<p>
Packages that have support for or rely on GNU Emacs can use two
eclasses to do some recurring tasks in a simple way.  The
documentation of the functions are provided in the eclasses, so they
are not repeated here!  Format of documentation is to allow man-page
generation from source with the
package <path>app-portage/eclass-manpages</path>.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><path>elisp-common.eclass</path></ti>
  <ti>Provides functions to handle Elisp files.  Compilation,
  installation and generation of autoloads is covered here in a
  general way.  Packages with optional Emacs support must rely on this
  eclass.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><path>elisp.eclass</path></ti>
  <ti>The functions from <path>elisp-common.eclass</path> are used to
  construct the default functions

  the <path>app-emacs</path> hierarchy of ebuilds.  It pulls in an
  appropriate version of Emacs (meaning a
  version of <path>virtual/emacs</path>, controlled
  by the <uri link="#need_emacs">NEED_EMACS</uri> variable) and
  is <e>not</e> intended for packages with optional (via USE flag)
  support for GNU Emacs.</ti>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</section>

<section id="eselect">
<title>Emacs eselect module</title>
<body>
<p>
Having several Emacs versions simultaneously installed on a system,
needs some caution by maintainers.  Usual pitfalls are file collisions
and installations of one slot using data from another.  As
described <uri link="#location">earlier</uri>, the executables are
suffixed with their corresponding version number.  All data files go
to similar directories, also distinguished by a version suffix.
</p>
<p>
To be independent of the installed version, the eselect module
from <path>app-admin/eselect-emacs</path> guarantees
that <path>/usr/bin/emacs</path> always points to the Emacs you want.
All ebuilds for the editor check if the symlink is set, and change it
to the highest available in the case where it does not exist.  If no
GNU Emacs is found, but XEmacs, all helper programs are symlinked to
the variants shipped with XEmacs.
</p>
<p>
The module file has some comments about how the code works.  For more
information how an eselect module is set up, consult the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/dev-guide.xml">documentation</uri>.
</p>

</section>

<section>
<title>Provided virtuals</title>
<body>
<p>
Sometimes the same functionality is available through different
packages.  To not force a subjective choice the maintainer made,
virtuals check if one of the alternatives is installed on the user's
system.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>virtual/editor</dt>
<dd>Just makes sure you have an editing capability available on your
  system, Emacs is one choice out of many.</dd>
<dt>virtual/emacs</dt>
<dd>This gives you the choice between several version of Emacs.
  Elisp packages can choose which virtual version is the minimum they
  need through the elisp.eclass.</dd>
<dt>virtual/emacs-cedet</dt>
<dd>The Collection of Emacs Development Environment Tools was
  traditionally available as a separate package
  <path>app-emacs/cedet</path>.  It is also shipped with Emacs
  versions from 23.2 on.</dd>
<dt>virtual/emacs-flim</dt>
<dd>There are several libraries that provide encoding functions for
  other packages.  If they are compatible to
  <path>app-emacs/flim</path>, they should provide the emacs-flim
  virtual.</dd> 
</dl>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Where Emacs team is upstream</title>
<body>
<p>
Not all packages maintained by the Emacs team are developed by people
from outside the Gentoo project (they are usually called upstream).
Most of those exceptions are for proper operation of GNU Emacs in the
Gentoo environment.
</p>
<p>
Sources of these packages are kept in the
<uri link="http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/emacs-tools.git">
Emacs-Tools Git repository</uri>.
They are released and brought to the Emacs overlay or to the Portage
tree when they have proven stable.
