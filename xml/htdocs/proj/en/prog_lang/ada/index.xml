			This project deals with various Ada compilers and libraries in portage. 
			At present two gnat compilers are provided, gnat-gcc by FSF and gnat-gpl by 
			AdaCore. Both are SLOtted and made to coexist, with the selection of the active
			compiler performed via eselect gnat module. There are multiple Ada libraries
			unde dev-ada, which are tuned to use these multiple compilers. Selection of the active
			lib variant is done simultaneously with the selection of the active compiler
			via the same eselect gnat command. More details on the setup can be found in the 
			resources section below and the lengthy discussion that lead to this system in 
			<uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111340">bug #111340</uri>.
		</p>

			This setup is in the transitional stage at the moment, however nearing completion.
			Its progress can be tracked in the 
			<uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137268">bug #137268</uri>. 
			"Old-style" dev-lang/gnat and dev-ada/asis packages will be removed when the new 
			setup is fully functional and thus are deprecated (dev-ada/asis is already masked,
			dev-ada/asis-{gcc,gpl} should be used instead). One remaining consideration is 
			dev-lang/gnat-3.15p, which still seem to have some preferential use by some people.
			However that version no longer works with new binutils and required an antiquated gcc 
			backend. Help is sought by those interested to keep this version alive, in case there
			is such desire.
