		<p>
			The Ruby project maintains packages for <uri link="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby
			</uri> implementations, libraries and development tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project also maintains the <uri link="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</uri> package,
			the de facto standard for packaging Ruby projects. Many Ruby packages currently in the
			Portage tree use this mechanism for installing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Highlighted packages include <uri link="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</uri>,
			<uri link="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</uri>,
			<uri link="http://www.capify.org/">Capistrano</uri>,
			and <uri link="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</uri>, to name a few.

        <title>Overview</title>
        <body>
          <p>
          In Gentoo multiple Ruby implementations can co-exist. This
          is supported through the RUBY_TARGETS mechanism. You can add
          the RUBY_TARGETS variable to your make.conf file to select
          which Ruby implementations you want to use on your
          system. By default only <c>ruby18</c> is selected.
          </p>

          <pre caption="/etc/make.conf">
            <var>RUBY_TARGETS</var>="ruby18 ruby19"
          </pre>

      <section>
        <title>Ruby 1.8.x (aka MRI): ruby18</title>
        <body>
          <p>
          This version of Ruby is our main implementation. It is
          available as the 1.8 slot of <c>dev-lang/ruby</c>. It is
          available in the stable tree, and almost all Ruby packages
          in the tree are available for this implementation.
          </p>
        </body>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Ruby 1.9.x: ruby19</title>
        <body>
          <p>
          This version of Ruby is currently still masked pending
          resolution of some issues. It is available as the 1.9 slot
          of <c>dev-lang/ruby</c>.
          <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203706">Bug 203706</uri>
          tracks the remaining issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to test Ruby 1.9 you will need to unmask the
            package and also the associated ruby_targets_ruby19 USE
            flag.

        <title>JRuby: jruby</title>
        <body>
          <p>
          This version of Ruby is based on the Java Virtual
          Machine. It is available as <c>dev-java/jruby</c>. It is
          currently only available in the testing tree.

        <title>Ruby Enterprise Edition: ree</title>
        <body>
          <p>
            This is an enhanced version of Ruby 1.8, featuring various
            enhancements, most notably in that it requires less memory
            to run. It is available as <c>dev-lang/ruby-enterprise</c>.
