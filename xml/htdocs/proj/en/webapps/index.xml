<longname>Gentoo web applications herd</longname>
<date>2005-06-19</date>

<description>
The web-apps team maintains web applications, an eclass to facilitate writing
ebuilds for these packages, and the webapp-config tool.
</description>

<longdescription>
<p>
The Gentoo webapp team maintains most web applications available via Portage.
In addition, we provide the webapp-config utility that allows users to
install ebuilds into different virtual hosts.
</p>

<p>
We are also responsible for the webapp.eclass that allows to prepare
web applications for installation with webapp-config.
</p>
</longdescription>

<goals>
Our goal is to make Gentoo the best platform for installing and maintaining web
applications. To achieve this goal, we work closely with several other herds
such as Apache and PHP.

<title>Web application overlay</title>

<body>

<p>
Web applications in general tend to be a severe security liability. They are
designed to communicate with the outside world and need to deal with a range of
input from the Internet. Since it is often hard for developers to foresee all
types of malicious input, security flaws are being detected rather frequently
in the apps we maintain.
</p>

<p>
To reduce the impact of such incidents while still offering a wide range of
different web applications, we created a Portage <uri
link="http://svn.gnqs.org/projects/gentoo-webapps-overlay">overlay</uri>
that contains ebuilds for applications that we do not want to maintain in the
main tree. Such applications either lack a developer willing to maintain it in
Portage or have not been reviewed for security.
</p>

<warn>
Please remember that the applications available through the overlay might
compromise the security of your server!
</warn>

<p>
The overlay is an ideal playground for new developers wishing to join our
team. Once we see that you are capable of writing ebuilds of reasonable
quality, we can provide you with commit rights to the overlay.

<section>
<title>webapp-config</title>

<body>

<p>
We recently switched from the old bash version of <c>webapp-config</c> to a
version implemented in Python, which is much faster and easier to maintain.

We are currently still debating the roadmap for <c>webapp-config</c>. If you
wish to get an overview of its current state of development, you can visit the
<uri link="http://www.vhost-tools.org">Trac repository</uri>.

If you have any complaints about the software, patches, or suggestions for
improvements, please <uri link="http://www.vhost-tools.org/newticket">submit a
ticket</uri>.
