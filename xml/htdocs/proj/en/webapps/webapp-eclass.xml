<title>Background</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>webapp.eclass</c> and <c>webapp-config</c> provide a standardized way to
maintain web applications on Gentoo. Server administrators can use the
<c>webapp-config</c> utility to install, upgrade, and remove software.
<c>webapp-config</c> relies on a package manager such as Portage to prepare
the application for installation into multiple virtual hosts. On Gentoo, this
is done by an ebuild that uses <c>webapp.eclass</c>.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this guide is to teach the reader how to create and maintain
ebuilds for web applications. It presents an overview of
<c>webapp.eclass</c> and then discusses three ebuilds of increasing complexity
and functionality. Using the <c>webapp-config</c> utility is beyond the scope
of this guide and is documented in <c>man 8 webapp-config</c>.
</p>

<section>
<title>Prerequisites</title>
<body>

<p>
This guide assumes a basic familiarity with Portage and the ebuild format. Both
are well-documented; the reader is encouraged to consult the <uri
link="/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml">official ebuild HOWTO</uri> and
the <uri link="http://devmanual.gentoo.org/">devmanual</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<c>webapp-config</c> is under active development. Be sure to install the latest
version; as of the time of this writing, it is 1.50.14. You can follow the
development process on our <uri
link="http://www.vhost-tools.org/">website</uri>.
</p>

<section>
<title>A standardized approach to installing web applications</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo has developed a standardized way of handling web applications. It is
outlined in <uri link="/proj/en/glep/glep-0011.html">GLEP 11</uri> and
discussed in detail in <c>man 5 webapp.eclass</c>. The reader is urged to
familiarize himself with these documents before proceeding. The manpage also
outlines the filesystem locations into which the eclass and
<c>webapp-config</c> install files; advanced users and developers should take
note.
</p>

<p>
By default, <c>webapp.eclass</c> will be found under
<path>/usr/portage/eclass/</path>. By definition, the source code is the
ultimate documentation and should be consulted whenever something does not
perform as expected or further clarification is required.

<chapter>
<title>Writing Ebuilds</title>
<section>
<title>Beginner: www-apps/gallery-2.0.2</title>
<body>

<p>
Many web applications require no compilation and are installed by copying their
files to a directory to be served by a httpd server such as Apache.
<c>webapp.eclass</c> simplifies this task by preparing the necessary set of
directories.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at a simple ebuild for <uri
link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/www-apps/gallery">www-apps/gallery-2.0.2</uri>.
To use any of the functions in the eclass, the ebuild must first inherit it:
</p>

<pre caption="Inheriting the eclass">
inherit webapp
</pre>

<p>
The ebuild then sets several standard variables, such as <c>DESCRIPTION</c>,
<c>IUSE</c>, <c>RDEPEND</c>, and <c>S</c>. The first important note is that
ebuilds that use <c>webapp.eclass</c> do not typically set the <c>SLOT</c>
variable (the rationale for this is described in the manpage). <uri
link="#doc_chap2_sect3">Section 2.3</uri> will explain how <c>SLOT</c> can be
set when it is truly needed, but for now we will let the eclass handle it.
</p>

<p>
<path>www-apps/gallery-2.0.2</path> does not require patching or compiling, so
the ebuild does not call <c>src_unpack</c> or <c>src_compile</c>; installation
is handled in <c>src_install</c>. The first thing <c>src_install</c> does is
call a special helper function that sets up the required directory structure:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up src_install">
src_install() {
  webapp_src_preinst
</pre>

<p>
This function is required of all ebuilds that use <c>webapp.eclass</c> and
override the default <c>src_install</c>.
</p>

<p>
Having set up the environment, the ebuild installs the web application:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing">
cp -R * ${D}/${MY_HTDOCSDIR}
</pre>

<p>
<c>${MY_HTDOCSDIR}</c> is one of the variables exported by
<c>webapp_src_preinst</c>. Files placed there will be copied into the right
directory under the webserver's document root by <c>webapp-config</c>. For a
full list of variables exported by the eclass, please see the manpage.
</p>

<p>
Next, the ebuild marks a file in <c>${FILESDIR}</c> as a file containing
instructions to be displayed by <c>webapp-config</c> after the application has
been installed:
</p>

<pre caption="Post-install instructions">
webapp_postinst_txt en ${FILESDIR}/postinstall-en2.txt
</pre>

<note>
A careful reader will observe that it is customary for other ebuilds to display
instructions to the user in <c>pkg_postinst</c>. Ebuilds that inherit
<c>webapp.eclass</c> may still do so, but the ebuild author should understand
the important difference in usage. More often than not, post-install
instructions include information specific to a virtual host, such as locations
of a particular configuration file or a URL to access the web application
remotely. This information is not available to Portage and cannot be included
in <c>pkg_postinst</c>. Instead, it should be included in a post-install file
and installed using <c>webapp_postinstall_txt</c>.
</note>

<p>
Let's examine a typical post-install file:
</p>

<pre caption="Post-install file">
  0. Create a new MySQL database:
  mysqladmin create geeklog

  1. Edit ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}-${PVR}/config.php and set database settings.

  2. Login on
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/admin/install/install.php
  and follow the directions.

  3. Don't forget to delete the admin/install directory when you're done!
</pre>

<p>
Post-install instruction files are plain text files. They can contain
bash-style variables (e.g., <c>${PN}</c>) that will be expanded at display
time. The <c>webapp-config</c> utility responsible for displaying the file
exports a number of variables that allow for the customization of instructions.
Consult the manpage for a list of available variables.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the ebuild calls another mandatory helper function:
</p>

<pre caption="webapp_src_install">
webapp_src_install
</pre>

<p>
<c>webapp_src_install</c> is responsible for setting the right permissions on
installed files.
</p>

<p>
There are several best practices for writing simple ebuilds:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Don't copy unneeded files. Some packages include <path>.svn</path> or
    <path>CVS</path> directories or <path>Makefiles</path>; those should be
    removed prior to installation. Note that the <path>LICENSE</path> file is
    sometimes needed by the application and should not be removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that consecutive calls to all ebuild functions succeed. For
    instance, don't remove files outside of <c>src_unpack</c>. If you must,
    remove files from <c>${D}</c> rather than <c>${S}</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    For portability purposes, don't use GNU-only extensions such as <c>cp
    -a</c>. They will break on non-GNU userlands such as Gentoo/FreeBSD.
  </li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Intermediate: www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.2</title>
<body>

<p>
Many web applications have a more complicated installation procedure. Let's
look at how <uri
link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/www-apps/tikiwiki">www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.2</uri>
handles one such package. After inheriting the eclass, the ebuild specifies a
number of required and optional dependencies.
</p>

<pre caption="Specifying Dependencies">
RDEPEND="virtual/php
  graphviz? ( media-gfx/graphviz )
"
</pre>

<p>
Many web-applications written in PHP require that the PHP binary have certain
capabilities built-in; common requirements include support for sessions and a
specific database engine. This is typically accomplished by using the
<c>depend.php</c> eclass; unfortunately, the author is not aware of any existing
documentation for that eclass. The reader is referred to the eclass itself for
further information and encouraged to consult relevant ebuilds in Portage.
</p>

<warn>
If the package requires specific Perl modules, all dependencies must have
ebuilds available. Relying on CPAN is not acceptable.
</warn>

<p>
A common mistake with specifying dependencies for web applications is to
<c>RDEPEND</c> on a database engine such as MySQL or
PostgreSQL.  Many, if not all, web applications are able to connect to a remote
database server. Thus, a local database should not be required.
</p>

<note>
Currently, it is not possible to depend on a generic webserver. Instead, you
must explicitly specify the webserver (e.g., <path>net-www/apache</path>). This
is inconvenient and has been reported in <uri
link="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11007">bug #11007</uri>; we hope
that this issue will be resolved soon.
</note>

<p>
<path>www-apps/tikiwiki</path> uses <c>depend.php</c> to check for a properly
configured PHP:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking PHP configuration">
pkg_setup () {
  webapp_pkg_setup
  use mysql &#x0026;&#x0026; require_php_with_use mysql
  use postgres &#x0026;&#x0026; require_php_with_use postgres
}
</pre>

<p>
Note the use of a mandatory helper function <c>webapp_pkg_setup</c>.
</p>

<p>
Many web applications require write access to certain files. The eclass
provides a helper function that marks a file as server-owned; at install time,
<c>webapp-config</c> will ensure that it has the right owner and permissions:
</p>

<pre caption="webapp_serverowned">
webapp_serverowned ${MY_HTDOCSDIR}/tiki-install.php
</pre>

<p>
<c>webapp_serverowned</c> takes an optional <c>-R</c> flag to recurse into
subdirectories. This flag has been added recently and not many ebuilds take
advantage of it. Please consult the manpage for more information.
</p>

<p>
Practically all web applications use configuration files to store settings.
Such files should not be placed into <path>/etc</path> (figuring out the
rationale is left as an exercise for the reader). To avoid losing important
configuration information, the eclass provides another helper function that
will instruct <c>webapp-config</c> not to overwrite an existing file. The
administrator can use familiar tools such as <c>etc-update</c> or
<c>dispatch-conf</c> to manage such files.
</p>

<pre caption="webapp_configfile">
webapp_configfile ${MY_HTDOCSDIR}/config.php
</pre>

<p>
To ease upgrades of web applications, the eclass provides a helper function
that displays instructions when an existing installation is being upgraded:
</p>

<pre caption="Post-upgrade file">
webapp_postupgrade_txt en ${FILESDIR}/postupgrade-en.txt
</pre>

<p>
Even though few ebuilds in Portage currently take advantage of this
functionality, the reader is encouraged to use it in his ebuilds.
</p>

<p>
The ebuild calls the familiar helper function to complete the installation.
Note an important consequence of using <c>webapp_src_install</c> to set the
correct file permissions: any manual adjustments to file permissions and
ownership via <c>fowners</c> and <c>fperms</c> must occur <e>after</e>
<c>webapp_src_install</c> is called.
</p>

<pre caption="Adjusting permissions">
webapp_src_install
fperms 0644 /etc/zm.conf
</pre>

<p>
The tikiwiki ebuild displays some brief notes using <c>pkg_postinst</c>. Note
the use of another helper function:
</p>

<pre caption="pkg_postinst">
pkg_postinst() {
  elog "To setup a MySQL database, run:"
  elog "\"emerge --config =${PF}\""
  elog "If you are using PostgreSQL, consult your documentation"
  webapp_pkg_postinst
}
</pre>

<p>
Strictly speaking, <c>webapp_pkg_postinst</c> is not mandatory. It is
responsible for automatically calling <c>webapp-config</c> when the
<c>vhosts</c> USE flag is unset. In rare instances it may be desirable to
override this behavior; please consult <path>www-apps/otrs</path> for an
example.
</p>

<section>
<title>Advanced: www-apps/moinmoin-1.5.0</title>
<body>

<p>
This section presents an overview of more advanced installation tasks provided
by <c>webapp.eclass</c>. An example of this functionality is <uri
link="http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/www-apps/moinmoin">www-apps/moinmoin-1.5.0</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<c>moinmoin</c> is a wiki engine written in Python that uses <c>distutils</c>
to install itself. Thus, it requires <c>SLOT="0"</c> to avoid collisions.
Ebuilds that inherit <c>webapp.eclass</c> must set
<c>WEBAPP_MANUAL_SLOT="yes"</c> to override the default <c>SLOT</c>ting
behavior:
</p>

<pre caption="Setting SLOT">
SLOT="0"
WEBAPP_MANUAL_SLOT="yes"
</pre>

<note>
The <c>yes</c> in <c>WEBAPP_MANUAL_SLOT="yes"</c> is case-sensitive.
</note>

<p>
<c>moinmoin</c> installs files that should not be served by the webserver. The
ebuild places such files in <c>${MY_HOSTROOTDIR}/${PF}</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing into dodir ${MY_HOSTROOTDIR}/${PF}">
dodir ${MY_HOSTROOTDIR}/${PF}
cp -r data underlay config/wikiconfig.py ${D}/${MY_HOSTROOTDIR}/${PF}
</pre>

<p>
A best practice for installing any application via Portage is to ensure it
operates out of the proverbial box with sensible defaults. The eclass
implements a helper function to aid with configuring the application after it
has been installed by <c>webapp-config</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="webapp_hook_script">
webapp_hook_script ${FILESDIR}/reconfig-2
</pre>

<p>
The reconfig hook is a script, typically written in bash, that is invoked by
<c>webapp-config</c> after installation and before removal.
</p>

<pre caption="Reconfig hook">
#!/bin/bash

die() {
  echo "#####"
  echo $1
  echo "#####"
  exit 1
}

if [ $1 = "install" ]; then
  sed -e "s|/path/to/wikiconfig|${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}-${PVR}|g" \
    -i ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/moin.cgi || die "sed failed"
  sed -e "s|\./data/|${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}-${PVR}/data|
    s|\./underlay/|${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}-${PVR}/underlay|" \
    -i ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}-${PVR}/wikiconfig.py || die "sed failed"

elif [ $1 = "clean" ]; then
  echo $1
fi
</pre>

<p>
The reconfig hook can use the same variables as the postinstall file. It is
typically used to edit configuration files to set file locations that may
differ from the default values. As of <c>webapp-config-1.50</c>, reconfig hooks
are run in a sandbox to minimize risk; please consult the manpage for more
details.
</p>

<p>
There are several best practices for using reconfig hooks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Die with an error message if the script failed</li>
  <li>
    Be careful about removing files when called with <c>clean</c>. Don't remove
    configuration files or any other files that may have been locally
    modified.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre caption="Using the reconfig hook to mark files as server-owned">
chown ${VHOST_SERVER_UID}:${VHOST_SERVER_GID} ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/Settings.php
</pre>

<p>
The eclass provides several other functions that are rarely used. The most
notable is <c>webapp_sqlscript</c>, which marks a file as an SQL create script.
In its current state, this function is only moderately useful.

<title>Apache</title>
<body>

<ul>
  <li>
    Be careful when installing apache configuration files. If you place a
    misconfigured Apache configuration file into
    <path>/etc/apache{2}/vhosts.d</path>, the server will fail on next restart.
    Is is better to either install the file elsewhere and let the administrator
    customize it, or comment out the contents to avoid failure.
