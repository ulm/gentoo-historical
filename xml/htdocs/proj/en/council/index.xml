			<title>Rationale</title>
			<body>
			<p>
			To ensure that the council stays active, the chosen metastructure
			model says that if a council member (or their appointed proxy) fails
			to show up for two consecutive meetings, they are marked as a slacker.
			</p>
			<p>
			If a council member who has been marked a slacker misses any further
			meeting (or their appointed proxy doesn't show up), they lose their
			position and a new election is held to replace that person. The
			'slacker' marker is reset when a member is elected.
			</p>
			<p>
			If any meeting has less than 50% attendance by council members, a new
			election for all places must be held within a month.
