I following devs have earned my respect and thus I think we should make 
up the council. Many others have earned my respect but are not listed 
here.

First thing I want there to be is clear distinction between a council and 
our board of trustees.

My feelings on what I want to see in a Gentoo council would be having a 
few people from the base system, security, hardened, server, embedded, 
portage, qa teams. Mostly a council that is almost purely for technical 
directions that Gentoo is going.

As it stands this is how I plan to vote and why. I would appreciate it 
if you would carefully consider the following candidates for the council.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike Frysinger (vapier)
- Cares enough to make Gentoo not suck.
- Often injects his own random humor at just the right time to keep things real.
- technically creative
- super human powers
- Keeps it real!

* Herds: arm base-system cron embedded games gcc-porting hppa ia64 net-fs netmon qmail toolchain vmware

 Mikes role in Gentoo goes way back. I look at him as equal peer. If and
 when I'm ever in unsure about something with Gentoo I usually consult
 with him first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Martin Schlemmer (azarah)
- Current lead of of base-system and thus all things Gentoo in my minds eye.
- displays wisdom.
- active c coder of core Gentoo utils/tools
- nice guy

* Herds: base-system gcc-porting mozilla pam toolchain x11 x11-drivers

 Martin is one of the few like Mike who has been extremely helpful to me
 mainly as an adviser from the tecnicial point of view. From him one of 
 the main lessons I've learned is how to avoid the flame wars. His 
 contributions for Gentoo speak for themselves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aron Griffis (agriffis)
- displays alot of wisdom for his age
- Writes decent tools

* Herds: alpha alpha-kernel base-system ia64 ia64-kernel mozilla toolchain

 Aron has a pretty good grasp of the inner workings of Gentoo. 
 I tend to respect his opinions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thierry Carrez (Koon)
- Current day to day operations mgr of the security team
- Exceptional origination skills
- Self motivated

* Teams: security

 His role to Gentoo has mostly been with the security team thus far.
 He came in and lent a hand in taking what we started to the next level 
 by getting things documented and helping fill in the missing gaps. Koon has 
 helped quite a few minions scount the 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ciaran McCreesh (ciaranm)
- technically component in many areas of computing
- adheres to a pretty strict self logic
- puts his own ass on the line for the sake of the tree

* Herds: base-system commonbox cron mips shell-tools sparc vim

 Ciarans limiting factor so far has been due to the fact he has not
 played such an active roll in the final decision making. Like myself I 
 think he is often misunderstood by the less than technically competent 
 crowd. I think if given the chance and backed up by the proper co council
 he will shine. He has good writing skills and would probably document 
 better than anyone else the workings of the council. Overall I think 
 he would make a valuable addition to the council. He can sometimes be 
 abrasive when somebody else proposes an idea that can globally hurt 
 Gentoo, but I don't mind that so much as my general feeling is if you 
 can't handle it then you need to stop trying to play with the big dogs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jason Wever (Weeve)
- Understands the need for proper q/a

 Write something about weeve here or somebody else from the older 
 hardware teams. (maybe kumba)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somebody from the portage team needs to be on this list but I'm not sure who yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danny van Dyk (Kugelfang)
- stuff.

 Kugelfang has been catching my eye as a pretty ok dev as of recent.
 I've not interacted with him enough on a day to day to really be able to
 have a formulated opinion, but I think he is a proper team player and helpful 
 where he can be to other devs which is a good sign. Kugelfang Maybe even a be 
 candidate fir the future base-system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Self (solar)

 I really don't like talking about myself so much but here goes anyway. 
 I've been a linux user for about 10 years. Those who have worked with me 
 know what I bring to the table. Those who don't should take to somebody 
 that does.

* Herds: base-system embedded hardened toolchain
* Teams: security infra

 I also try and help out or learn from/with my fellow devs in 14 or so
 gentoo related irc channels.

 My main contributions to Gentoo so far include the formations of the 
 initial security team, the embedded team and am probably the most active 
 member of the hardened team. 

 One of the lessons I learned early on is that Gentoo is about choice.
 While most choice is good there are a few choices that clearly could
 severely damage the tree, our reputation or even worse our systems.
 Choices such as these which can have adverse effects need to be 
 made by a competent team such as the one I've outlined here.
 My passion is coding, I do it mainly for myself. Unlike a few unnamed
 souls that I wont mention here out of respect I don't try to force my
 code or ideas down your throats. I think that is about respecting choice.
 I work primarily behind the scenes avoiding conflict and looking for
 creative solutions to problems where and when I can.

 It's not within my power alone but I fully support the idea of an
 Gentoo Enterprise/Stable Linux, and am willing to work with anybody 
 else that wishes to move in that direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People that are trustees:

 If other devs don't think there really needs to be a clear distinction
 between a council and our board if trustees then the following guys
 deserve to win some votes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sven Vermeulen (Swift)
- This guy got the xml docs going.
- Has a pretty good grasp of the old school big picture and I've yet to see him steer us wrong
- He has been  expediently helpful to me personally over these past few years

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lance Albertson (Ramereth)
- Self motivated
- treats others with respect
- good at putting out the fires
- day to day operations mgr of infra
- earn my personal respect

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joshua Kinard (kumba)
- Orig author of the crossdev util
- He maintains close relationships with sparc/mips teams
- pretty damn funny and keeps it real

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
