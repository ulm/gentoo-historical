This mail has the mastor ballot file attached to it. You were also
mailed with your ID. You can use the file and the ID to verify that
your vote was included in the master ballot file. If you didn't get
your ID or you can't find your vote inside the ballot file, please
contact election officials (rane, antarus, jmbsvicetto, fox2mike (@g.o
or #gentoo-elections on freenode)).

The turnout was (I think record) 57%. We received 143 valid votes and
two invalid (two people who forgot to issue votify --submit).

Thanks for all the votes and kind regards,

For election officials,

Lukasz Damentko
