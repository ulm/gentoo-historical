My main plans over the next few years would be to improve
communications (and (more importantly?) openness), not just between
developers, but also between herds, users, the Council, the Trustees,
upstream and so on. I'd particularly want to ensure that there is better
communication between us (Gentoo) and projects such as Sabayon Linux
and Ainkaboot, as I believe that we can all make use of each other's
skills and ideas to provide better distribution(s). I'd encourage
"innovative" ideas and projects, such as the inclusion of, for example,
XGL/Compiz/Beryl/Compiz-Fusion or whatever it's called these days. I'd
also encourage the introduction of targets, as discussed by antarus on
the -core ML. And all that kinda stuff.

Now, I'm sure that a number of you would prefer everything to be
closed, kept private within a number of individuals, but if that *is*
the case, why on Earth are you involved with an *Open* Source project,
such as Gentoo? Wouldn't you be better off using the likes of Adobe's
products and Microsoft's products?

Yes, I am quite young. Yes, I could be considered relatively new to the
project. Yes, I might make mistakes, but I also *learn* from mistakes,
which some people seem to find hard. Being young/relatively new to the
project will allow me to potentially bring a fresh view on things, that
some of you old fuddy-duddies may or may not have thought of before.
And isn't that what Gentoo is about? New ideas, innovation, fresh
views, etc, etc. Anyway. Meh. I'm starting to waffle on.

> 1) What you will do
> 2) Why you will do it
> 3) How you will do it
Black magik. Encouragement of ideas such as project updates, at least
some support and/or contributions to those who work on other
Gentoo-based distros, taking their ideas and contributions into the
tree, etc, etc. One possible idea would be to encourage people to use
one channel for primary communications, currently, many people make
decisions (in private?) on IRC, then "forget" to tell everyone else
about the decision... If we were all encouraged to make decisions on
relevant email aliases, on the right mailing list, etc, etc, there
would be less people missing out. The -project, -dev-announce and -dev
setup we've got at the moment seems to be a start in the right
direction from what I can see so far. It does require more time to wear
in before it can really be seen as a success or a failure.
> 4) What is the timescale for doing it
This depends on who is involved with the efforts, who agrees, who wants
to bring up (potentially) silly arguments, etc, etc. It's not really
possible to set a deadline for something when you don't know who you
will be working with.
> 5) What experience do you have with this or a similar role
I'm the lead of the Gentoo/*BSD team, the Gentoo/Alt ATs and the Bugday
team. The latter two teams do require quite a bit of user interaction,
which could be useful for the implementation of some of my ideas.
> 6) Why do you think you are qualified
Hrm, how different is this question to the question above? Meh. Well, I
suppose I am quite vocal - I speak to people a lot. I'm involved with a
local LUG. See answer to question above...
> 7) How you plan to balance a council role with your current Gentoo
> role
Council will take precedence over most/all of my other roles. I will
probably also be dropping out of some of the teams/projects where I
have been relatively inactive.
> 8) How much time can you dedicate to the council role
Hmm. Well, around 7.5hrs a day if needs be. I should be able to pull
out more hours from the hat, dependant on my school timetable for the
next academic year.
