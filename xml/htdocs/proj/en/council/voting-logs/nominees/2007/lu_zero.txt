Ok

Probably I'll try my best to make sure what is decided in the council
will end up with something implemented, hopefully in a timely fashion,
no matter how unpopular may be perceived.
E.g.: push for getting an EAPI 1.1 with some nice stuff, like the IUSE
defaults, out asap and use them on the tree.

> 2) Why you will do it

Because I like to help and maybe I still have some sanity to invest into
this project

> 3) How you will do it

Basically trying to be balanced and to keep things on the technical
field. I like to offer alternative solutions but usually I try to pick
the best one (possibly not what I proposed, I'm an fan of the antiNIH
movement)

> 4) What is the timescale for doing it

"This is an opensource project, we deliver things when we feel it is
ready". I'll try my best to keep things going smoothly and that also
includes suggesting/changing leads in subprojects or have parallel
subprojects spawned to let people willing to do have their share of fun.

> 5) What experience do you have with this or a similar role

Messed with politics in my University, I'm a member of different
associations of different sizes with deciding roles of various degree

> 6) Why do you think you are qualified

Usually I try to get along with everybody and I try to let people know
when I'm biased towards something (being unbiased is too hard)

> 7) How you plan to balance a council role with your current Gentoo role

There aren't conflicts so far for my gentoo role and my outside roles
(e.g. me being an ffmpeg/mplayer developer)

> 8) How much time can you dedicate to the council role

Enough to be present, not enough to be annoying (hopefully)

Feel free to ping me on irc if you have questions ^^
