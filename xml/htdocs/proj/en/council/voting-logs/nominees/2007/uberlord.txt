I've been nominated, and I've accepted (after bribery of beer :P). I'm
also a current Council member.

I'm not going to tell you why you should vote for me, as I'm not a
politician.
I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do if I was voted back in
because I don't have a game plan as such.

And when it comes right down to it, it *is* a popularity contest. Or
rather who would you trust the most to make decisions you agree with. So
you're really voting for someone like-minded and is probably more
eloquent and vocal than yourself.

I've said my piece. You'll vote for me if you agree with my technical
decisions and you find yourself siding with me (even mentally) in the
few discussions I take part in on -dev and #-dev.

Thanks

Roy
