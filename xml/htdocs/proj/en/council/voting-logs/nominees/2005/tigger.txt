I accept the nomination. Shan't give a goals/aims speech thing. You all
know me well enough to decide whether you think I'd be a good council
member or not.


[a day later ...]


Ok,

Changed my mind about the whole speech thing after the latest round of
rubbish. So here is my "speech":

If elected I would aim to reduce the amount of bs on -core by
application of big sticks. I would also attempt to reduce the crazy
amount of arguments about arguments (which seems to be what it all is).

When so many people think -core is fit for /dev/null something is
seriously fucked up isn't it? (that's a trick question...)

Even worse is if we consider "but it was in an email to -core" as a
reason for everyone to know something and yet continue to pollute it
with bickering.

I am anti-democracy-for-gentoo and favour meritocracy, so vote for me!

(haha, that's so messed up, I don't beleive in voting so vote for me...)

This concludes our party-unpolitical broadcast.
