Just a short something about me ... I have been a dev since July 2001.
I did most of the rc-script enhancements the first two or so years
('use', 'before' and 'after' logic, etc), did most of Gnome back then
after Hallski left, maintained X, maintained most of base-system at some
stage, maintained most of toolchain at some stage ... basically global
tree maintenance.  Also was the author (planner?) of gcc-config and
opengl-update (OK, so both have evolved some since ;) ).

Then real life (aka work) got a hold of me, and I went mia for a bit.
That should fortunately be something of the past now.

In general I rather try to focus on development, and believe that we
should not get involved in politics (yeah rich now, but mostly why I do
not add to the flames).

That should be about that I think.
