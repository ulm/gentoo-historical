My real name is Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen I've just turned 30 and I live in
Aarhus, Denmark. Currently I'm working as an IT consultant at a large Danish
hospital implementing VOIP. Previously I've been sysadminning at a Danish
facility hosting provider. Both places running Gentoo boxes in production.

I've been running Gentoo since late 2002 when I decided to do a scratch install
on the laptop I used for writing my thesis (about searching in distributed
networks). Soon after that I installed Gentoo on all my personal computers, 6 so
far (plus an OpenWRT box). I was recruited in May 2004 by Kurt Lieber to help
out the Security Team and have crunched out a few GLSAs since then and closed a
few more bugs. I have also contributed to a few ebuilds and documents and I'm
the author of the Gentoo mailfiltering gateway guide. I also tried to get GLEP
19 off the ground some time back with a few other developers. It failed to
really take off at the time, but I'm still hoping to be able to help out with
Gentoo Stable/Enterprise one day.

My work with the Security Team has primarily consisted of coordination between
different developers involved in the security process. I have reasonable
diplomatic skills and generally try to handle everyone with respect. On a more
controversial note I do believe large open source projects like Gentoo should
have an opinion about relevant IT politicial matters. As with
bureacracy/organization I believe both issues should be kept to a minimum so
developers can do their work unhindered but nonetheless both things are
necessary.
