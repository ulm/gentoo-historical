I believe most of you know me (after all I'm part of the wood work
around here now). For those of you who don't here is a very quick bit
about myself...

I'm from the UK, and I have worked on Gentoo for some years now. I
mostly stick to Kernel related work, but still quite often delve in
other peoples things (when asked) or outdated packages.
I have a strong belief that what we do is helping hundreds (thousands
and millions!) and I also have a lot of pride from working with many
talented individuals over the years. I will strive to ensure that the
decisions the council make are for the all round good, and also
technically accurate, efficient and justified. After all, I want success
as much as the next person :)

Not going to waffle, so I will return you all to your regular scheduled
programming.
