Well, agriffis suggested that we all write up why you should vote for us for
the council, so here goes...

The council is envisioned mainly as a technical decision-making body, that
votes on things affecting multiple projects within Gentoo. So, as the theory
goes, its members should know at least something about as many of the projects
and areas of development as possible. While I don't claim to be nearly the
'best' dev in that regard, I do know at least something about a few of the
projects. For those who (quite understandably) haven't picked up on what I do
with my time, I head up the Gentoo/FreeBSD project, work on the Mips port, and
specifically the selinux/mips profile and related goodies. So, I could be said
to tinker with hardened as well. I also know the portage code to some extent,
having had to make a few changes to it for the freebsd red-headed stepchild
project. I also idle in a number of the #gentoo-* irc channels, so I know at
least something about how a lot of the projects work. 

I think that covers most of the areas that are likely to be initiating major 
changes (portage development, non-glibc/non-linux systems, generally areas of 
'new' development / stuff that's vastly different to what the tools were 
designed for), as well as those that seem to get screwed over at random the 
most (arch teams, to some extent hardened, generally those that aren't running
the same system as everyone else). 

Alternatively, vote for ciaranm for the same reasons, except that he knows
more than I do about most of them.
