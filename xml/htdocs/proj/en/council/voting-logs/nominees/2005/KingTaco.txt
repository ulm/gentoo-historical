A bit about myself:  For those who don't know me, I'm the amd64
strategic lead, as well as a member of devrel.

If elected, my goals are very simple:  I want to remove as much bs as
possible from the developers life.  Every minute a developer spends not
doing development is a waste of his/her time, and everyone loses
out.(users included)  Lets work together to streamline processes and
procedures to minimize the amount of time a dev has to spend not doing
development.  Giving developers more time to do what they do best will
make gentoo a better distro.
