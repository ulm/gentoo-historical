My history with Gentoo goes back to 2001.  I had been developing for
other distros prior to that and found my way to Gentoo by reading one
of Daniel Robbins's DeveloperWorks articles.  I jumped on IRC and
helped solve some early portage problems, particularly "try vs. die"
(which is famous only in my own mind) and file corruption issues that
were the result of writing directly on top of existing files instead
of moving the old ones aside first.  Daniel asked me to be a developer
and I dove in head first.

Since then I've worn a number of hats.  I've worked on a lot of
architecture issues, contributing to alpha and ia64 in particular.
I've maintained or co-maintained a number of packages, including bash,
mozilla, firefox, thunderbird, mutt, mercurial, vim, xcut,
xautomation, ctrlproxy, lilypond, librep, rep-gtk, sawfish, plucker,
subversion, jpilot and baselayout.  I also wrote mozilla-launcher,
epm, echangelog, ekeyword, eviewcvs and votify.  I didn't originally
author keychain, but all of the code in it is mine at this point. ;-)
Finally, I was one of the original trustees, but I chose not to run
this year because I believe my skills are more suited to making
technical contributions.

Technical contributions are important for anybody wanting to
facilitate cross-project decisions.  Sometimes a good technical
solution will allow two projects to forge ahead in peace when they
were previously at odds.  When that isn't possible, it's important to
get along with other developers and find a way forward.  I believe
I get along with my fellow developers.  I have my own opinions, but
I work hard to understand the perspectives of other developers, and
I'm not shy about backing down and admitting I was wrong.

I look forward to serving on the Gentoo Council if I am elected.
