For those who
don't know me I'm Tom Knight (tomk), I live in Sheffield, UK and I'm a work
as a coder for a text messaging company (I recently wrote the thing which
calculates the votes for Big Brother, although that's probably lost me a few
votes:). I've been using Linux for 6 years, the last 2 of which I've been
using Gentoo. I was originally drawn to Gentoo by the great community and
the way that everything worked well and looked really nice without any
bloat.

My main area of work has been on the forums where I've been a moderator
since March 2004 and an admin since April 2005. I've taken over the role of
maintaining, upgrading and fixing the forums software. I've implemented many
new features focusing on security, SQL optimisation and making the
day-to-day running of the forums less time-consuming so that moderators have
more time to help out.

I've been a dev since July 2004, working in the net-mail and php herds and I
also maintain app-editors/joe. Although I haven't been around as long as
some of the other nominees, I think I've got some qualities that would make
me a good choice for the council: I've got good all-round technical
knowledge, I'm a rational decision maker and I've got good diplomatic
skills.
