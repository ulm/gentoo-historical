My life as a Gentoo Dev started on April the 11th 2004 when I was recruited by 
Jason Huebel to help the Gentoo/AMD64 Project (then 'porting team') with the 
increasing number of bugs. Since that time I also joined the Gentoo Scientific 
Project where I help to maintain mainly libraries (blas, lapack and 
derivates). Nowadays I serve (together with Mike Doty and Simon Stelling) as 
one of the Gentoo/AMD64 head monkeys and help Aaron Walker and others to get 
app-admin/eselect working.

My non-Gentoo live mainly consists of studying physics at Dortmund University, 
currently being in my second year and merely a month before pre-diploma. In my 
current job I assist a befriended graduate student with his research on 
'Diagnosis and localization of discrete damages by measurement of 
eigenfrequencies'.

I would enjoy serving as a member of the Gentoo Council and I will appreciate 
every vote :-)
