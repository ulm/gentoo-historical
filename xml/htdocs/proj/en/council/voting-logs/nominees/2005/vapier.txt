i'm Mike, ive been around for a little while (joined in Sep 2002), and i dont 
really like writing non-technical materials, so this will probably be a bit 
plain and more like a brain dump.

i enjoy hacking on Gentoo and prefer to drop the bullshit since it wastes time 
and prevents me from focusing on coding.  ive worked on a bunch of packages 
throughout the tree at one point or another, mostly on a personal quest 
dubbed "i wish i was as cool as az".  you can find me on irc as SpanKY or 
vapier as one of those dual-nick bastards; just look for the guy me acting 
gay/retarded/etc... in an endless misguided effort to break down stereotypes 
and liven up people's day.  you had a bad day huh ?  well here, touch my 
wang, that'll make it all better.

i currently have leading roles in misc Gentoo projects with other devs, such 
as Games, QA, base-system, toolchain, and embedded.  i like to delve into low 
level details because we tend lack developers who have such knowledge and it 
makes it a pita trying to resolve bugs when you lack such resources.

my driving force is a love of giving people unrestricted choices; i love the 
idea of public domain, wish *everything* was in public domain, and wish the 
people who came up with the ideas of copyrights, intelluctual property, and 
licenses never existed.  as part of this ideal, i respect other people's 
decisions and recognize that not everyone feels the way i do, so you wont 
find me acting like RMS trying to force the minds of others.  i'm a software 
communist but that doesnt mean you should be too (unless you want to).  
better red than dead eh
