My platform is pretty simple, I want Gentoo to get back to doing fun and
innovative things.  If you are also sick of all of the politics and want
to take the no bullshit approach, that's what I want to try to achieve.
We are all volunteers and there is no reason to needlessly troll or bash
other people's work.
