Minor architectures stabilisation policy
========================================
Discussion from last week's meeting was continued. Options considered
were a) to drop all ebuilds to an unstable keyword and b) the
following proposal of rich0, hereinafter called "package-by-package":

  "If a maintainer has an open STABLEREQ, or a KEYWORDREQ blocking a
  pending STABLEREQ, for 90 days with archs CCed and otherwise ready
  to be stabilized, the maintainer can remove older stable versions of
  the package at their discretion. A package is considered ready to be
  stabilized if it has been in the tree for 30 days, and has no known
  major flaws on arches that upstream considers supported."

It was agreed that there should be a separate vote for each
architecture in question.

* m68k
  Vote: Drop all ebuilds to unstable keyword.
  - Accepted unanimously.

* s390
  Vote: Drop all ebuilds to unstable keyword.
  - Accepted unanimously.

* sh
  Vote: Drop all ebuilds to unstable keyword.
  - Accepted with 5 yes votes and 1 no vote.

* ia64
  Vote: Action is required for this architecture.
  - Accepted with 3 yes votes, 2 no votes, and 1 abstention.
  Vote: Drop to unstable globally, or package-by-package.
  - Package-by-package proposal accepted unanimously.

* sparc
  Vote: Action is required for this architecture.
  - Rejected, tie vote (3 yes votes, 3 no votes).

* alpha
  Vote: Action is required for this architecture.
  - Accepted with 4 yes votes, 1 no vote, and 1 abstention.
  Vote: Drop to unstable globally, or package-by-package.
  - Package-by-package proposal accepted unanimously.

In summary:
- m68k, s390, sh: will be dropped to unstable keywords globally.
- alpha, ia64: Maintainers can remove older stable versions according
  to the "package-by-package" proposal.
- sparc: No action.

GLEP draft "Prefix with libc"
=============================
* GLEP draft
  After a short discussion, the following vote was taken:
  "The council endorses the GLEP draft for RAP and encourages its
  further refinement (including inside the portage tree if helpful).
  The council looks forward to the final draft for eventual approval."
  - Accepted unanimously.

* Reinitiation of a GLEP team and recovery of the GLEP process.
  - Action: rich0 will put out a call for volunteers.

[At this point, time had passed the one hour that was allocated for
the meeting, and some council members had to leave. Therefore, agenda
topics 4 and 5 were skipped and another meeting was scheduled for the
following week.]
