Roll call
=========
Present: blueness, dilfridge, radhermit, rich0, ulm, williamh
Absent: dberkholz

Dynamic dependencies in Portage
===============================
During discussion, is was remarked that some changes, e.g. to
dependencies in eclasses, could require mass rebuilds of packages.

Vote:
- "The council asks the Portage team to first outline their long-term
  plan regarding removal or replacement of dynamic dependencies,
  before they remove this feature. In particular, tree policies and
  the handling of eclasses and virtuals need to be clarified."
  Accepted unanimously.

Note added in proof: The Portage team does not intend to remove
dynamic dependencies, but only change their default to "off".

Additional features for EAPI 6
==============================
The three proposed features were discussed and voted on separately.

- Pass additional --docdir and --htmldir options to configure:
  Accepted with 5 yes votes and 1 abstention.

- Additional default suffixes for dohtml:
  Rejected with 5 no votes and 1 abstention.

- Variant of || () that is not runtime-switchable
  (provisional approval, under the condition that the feature will
  only be included if an implementation is ready):
  Accepted unanimously.

Open bugs with council involvement
==================================
- Bug 424647 "archives.gentoo.org: Broken URLs for e.g.
  gentoo-dev-announce and others" [3]
  No progress.
  Action: Remove council from CC.

- Bug 477030 "Missing summary for 20130611 council meeting" [4]
  ulm has written a summary, which is approved.
  Action: Commit the summary, close bug.

- Bug 503382 "Missing summaries for 20131210, 20140114, and 20140225
  council meetings" [5]
  No progress since last meeting.

- Bug 520074 "GLEP 39 rump council privilege escalation in secret
  meeting" [6]
  Most council members are of the opinion that this is of little
  practical relevance.
  Action: Remove council from CC.

Open floor
==========
dilfridge remarks that axs has revbumped all ebuilds in dev-perl to
EAPI 5. Some more complex ebuilds installing perl modules remain, so
perl-cleaner is still needed.
