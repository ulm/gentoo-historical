Adding support files to packages without maintainer consent

commits (as outlined in the devmanual) are sufficient. No policy
changes are required.

Code of Conduct approval
========================
The council discussed scarabeus's proposal for a new Code of Conduct.
A vote was then taken to accept, reject, or revisit the issue later.
- Revisit later (accepted with 4 votes)

Reflection discussion on the term of this council
=================================================
General opinion was that the workflow in the past year was efficient.
Approval of EAPI 5 was an important accomplishment.

Open floor
==========
mgorny reported on the progress of the multilib effort: xlibs and
part of soundlibs are done. There is only slow progress with baselibs;
some bugs did not get any reply for many months.
