 * vote/discuss:

   * Use $@ to append extra arguments to the "default" function in
     src_configure and src_install functions

	The council believes that $@ is not the ideal way to pass extra arguments
	to the default function. It was deciced to either introduce new variables
	for that purpose or do nothing about this and ask developers to
	re-implement the "default" function if they need to pass extra arguments.
	This will be pushed back to the gentoo-dev mailing list.

 * next meeting:

   Will be decided by the new council


 * open floor:

   No issues were brought to the council attention.
