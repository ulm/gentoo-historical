EAPI-3 status
=============
The ETA of EAPI-3[1] is roughly 3 months. The currently implemented
EAPI-3 items have no significant benefits to warrant a new EAPI with
only the items that are already implemented.
Because prefix support will be EAPI-3 (see below), the EAPI items
referenced here will be referred to as EAPI-4 in the future.

Prefix support
==============
The council accepts (4x yes, 2x abstain) the technical proposition
about Prefix support made to it by now, in the form of a PMS patch[2],
answers by the Prefix team members to the discussion thread[3] and the
portage branch[4] implementing this.

The council majority voted for a quick prefix-specific EAPI bump,
from here-on known as EAPI-3. The previously intended collection
of EAPI changes for a EAPI-3 will likely be referenced from now on
as EAPI-4 instead.

mtime preservation
==================
The council majority voted to document precisely the current behavior
of portage and what can be relied upon as part of the upcoming EAPI-3
(prefix support EAPI), so that since EAPI-3 the current portage
behaviour can be relied upon from all compliant package managers.
The exact behaviour needs to still get documented, however.


Next meeting
============
The date for the January meeting is still to be decided. Mondays are
now incompatible with solar's schedule. Calchan has volunteered to
follow-up discussions before the meeting and write the agenda if the
date was pushed back a week at least. Betelgeuse will not be available
during week 2 (Jan 10-16).
