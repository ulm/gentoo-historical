Absence of Tiziano(dev-zero)
=============================

Tiziano Muller(dev-zero) appointed Ciaran McCreesh(ciaranm) as his proxy on the
council@g.o alias. However, four out of the seven council members agreed
that proxies must be gentoo developers(which ciaranm is not) just as council
members must be. Thus, because Tiziano did not attend the meeting he is
considered absent.

Topics:
===========

    - Define EAPI development/deployment cycles
        No vote was taken on this, though many members were not supportive of
        the 'codename for features' part.

    - EAPI 3 progress
        Zac Medico(zmedico) reported that he'd been pretty active with portage
        development the past week and that EAPI 3's implementation should be
        done within a month.

    - Discussing the past year
        Petteri(Betelgeuse) mentioned having a web application to handle agenda
        creation and approval by council members to streamline the policy set
        towards the end of the term to 'ACK' agendas before the meeting.
