The agenda included Gentoo's participation in Google's Summer of Code
and an update on portage gpg signing.  In the former case, Gentoo has
applied to participate, and assuming we get one of the handful of
remaining slots then gerrynjr will be Gentoo's "organization
admininstrator" (with userrel's help) for the project.  In the latter
case, council developement of a reasonable key policy has stalled, and
they are soliciting GLEPs to help solve the problem.
