Summary of Gentoo council meeting 10 Jun 2014



Roll call
============

Present: blueness, creffett (proxy for williamh), dberkholz, dilfridge, rich0, scarabeus, ulm



Approve Preliminary EAPI 6 Features
===================================
The rest of the EAPI6 were discussed and voted on.  Vote results listed here:

User patches
The council endorses an eapply_user function in the PM to apply user
patches in EAPI6.  This will be called by the default src_prepare, and
must be called once if src_prepare is overrided by either a non-virtual
ebuild or eclass.
Aye: blueness, creffett (proxy for williamh), dilfridge, rich0, scarabeus, ulm
Nay: dberkholz
Passed

PATCHES support in default src_prepare
bug #463692
(This item was re-visted in light of user patches being approved)
Aye: blueness, creffett (proxy for williamh), dilfridge, rich0, scarabeus, ulm
Nay: dberkholz
Passed

Patch applying function in package manager
bug #463768
Needed for PATCHES support and user patches
This would duplicate epatch() from eutils, in simplified form.
Name "eapply" has been suggested.
(This item was not voted upon, as it was considered implied by the
acceptance of the other two patch features.)

Max EAPI Count in Tree / Min Time Between EAPI
==============================================
See the log for full discussion, but the Council felt that since future
Councils already need to approve new EAPIs, they can decide at that time
whether doing so is appropriate.

Should the council set a limit on # of EAPIs?
Nay: blueness, creffett (proxy for williamh), dberkholz, dilfridge, rich0, scarabeus, ulm

Should the council set a minimum time between EAPIs?
Nay: blueness, creffett (proxy for williamh), dberkholz, rich0, scarabeus, ulm
Abstain: dilfridge


Semi-official Dev-hosted Services
=================================
The Council accepted this provided that the name assignments make it
clear what is and isn't official. *.dev.gentoo.org and *.labs.gentoo.org
were given as possible suggestions.

Aye: blueness, dberkholz, dilfridge, rich0, scarabeus, ulm
Abstain: creffett (proxy for williamh)
