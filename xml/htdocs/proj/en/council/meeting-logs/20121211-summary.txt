Handling separate /usr support
==============================
After the discussion on [1] during the previous meeting, a delay of one
month due to a new fork of udev was requested.  We need an update on
what's happened.

Chainsaw reported udev and eudev have moved on, and for both it is now
possible to have a separate /usr.  The follow-up discussion related to
the /usr-merge is necessary.
