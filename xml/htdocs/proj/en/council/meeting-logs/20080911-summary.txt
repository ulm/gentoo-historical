Last time there was an empty slot, we voted on whether to fill the slot 
with the next person from the original rankings. Let's do the same this 
time. It's Cardoe.

Goal: Vote whether to approve Cardoe for the empty council slot.

Result: Cardoe is a new council member.

PMS as a draft standard of EAPI 0
---------------------------------
Next meeting is Sept 11, and we request that everyone involved with PM 
development or the spec email gentoo-dev about any issues with it. 
Otherwise, it's likely to be approved as a draft standard.

Goal: Vote whether to approve PMS as a draft standard of EAPI 0.

Requirements:

  - There needs to be a PMS lead who is a Gentoo dev [calchan].
    Both cardoe & antarus volunteered if this was needed.
  - Document the conflict resolution process that we agreed upon last 
    week [calchan].
  - Document the patch acceptance process [halcy0n].
  - Create a public mailing list so discussions & patches aren't lost on 
    the pms-bugs alias [cardoe].

Result: PMS is a draft standard of EAPI 0, with acceptance conditional 
upon resolution of the above 4 requirements. They should be resolved 
within 2 weeks.
