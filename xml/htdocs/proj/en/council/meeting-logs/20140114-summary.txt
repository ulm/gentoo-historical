Formalizing top-level profiles at EAPI=5
========================================

dilfridge:
"Making the whole profile tree EAPI=5

(This involves setting EAPI=5 in the main profiles directory, then 
moving the eapi-5-files files to a suitable place (base?) and removing 
the eapi-5-files directory.)

The 10.0 profiles were deprecated on 2 Feb 2013 and removed from 
profiles.desc on 9 Feb 2013, i.e. since then everyone should have 
switched to a 13.0 profile using EAPI=5 anyway.

The plan was to wait one year from that moment on."

(The previous vote was 2 for ≥1yr, 2 for ≤1yr, 2 for exactly 1 yr [one 
of which noted our standard 1-year support])

We already voted on the timing, so we just need to vote on the 
implementation now that we're at the cutoff.

My suggestion for the vote:
I propose we send out a final 30-day notice to give people a last 
chance, then point at some of the writeups on migration paths for old 
systems using snapshots.


Vote: we will send 30-day notice and then switch all profile directories 
to EAPI 5.

Approved unanimously.
