Modernization/adaption of the Code of Conduct
=============================================

Goal: Vote on whether to slightly modify the CoC with the below changes
Time: 5 minutes

Last meeting, a minimally modernized version of the CoC page 
"Consequences" section was presented by dilfridge. Consensus was that - 
since this is a sensitive area - the text would be sent to the project 
mailing list for discussion and decided in the next council meeting.

The proposed text is in reference 2.
