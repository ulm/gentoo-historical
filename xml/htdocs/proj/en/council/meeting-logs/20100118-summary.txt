prefix
======
The final implementation of prefix was unanimously approved for inclusion in
EAPI3.

mtime preservation
==================
The final implementation of mtime preservation was unanimously approved for
inclusion in EAPI3.

xz unpacking in EAPI3
=====================
xz unpacking was planned for EAPI4 but was already ready. Porting this feature
to EAPI3 is trivial. The council approved xz unpacking to be included in
EAPI3.

Final approval of EAPI3
=======================
EAPI3 was approved by the council.

GLEP 57
=======
GLEP57 was approved by the council.

GLEPs 58 to 61
==============
The vote on GLEPs 58 to 61 was postponed due to more discussions being
necessary.

Multiple ABIs
=============
The council unanimously rejected the request for inclusion of the Multiple
ABIs code in the portage 2.2 branch. Instead it was suggested to follow Zac's
(zmedico) recommendation of maintaining it in a separate branch which is going
to be made easier by the fact that the portage repository is being switched to
git. Zac offered to help Thomas (tommy) with that.
