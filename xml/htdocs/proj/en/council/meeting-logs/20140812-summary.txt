Roll call
=========
Present:
blueness, dberkholz, scarabeus (proxy for dilfridge), radhermit,
rich0, ulm, williamh

Handling of bash-completion
===========================
After a short discussion of the topic, a majority of council members
agreed that it is up to the shell-tools team to resolve the issue.
dberkholz recommends that the eselect module should be kept, with
all completions enabled by default but allowing opt-out by users.

Phase functions in eclasses
===========================
The council voted unanimously that more discussion of this topic in
the gentoo-dev mailing list will be needed.

The question was then raised if we should move away from phase
functions in eclasses altogether. Council members expressed different
opinions on this. No vote was taken.

Games team policies
===================
The discussion focussed upon two issues, namely that the games team
allegedly tries to enforce policies on packages that they are not
maintaining, and that they have not responded to some requests for
joining their team.

The following decisions were taken:

- Motion: "Every developer is allowed to commit and maintain games
  ebuilds, without the need to ask for permission or review from the
  games team. The games team does not have authority to override
  maintainer decisions on packages they don't maintain."
  Accepted unanimously.
  Note: This should be understood as clarification of existing policy.

- There is consensus amongst council members that specific policies
  (e.g., games group, /usr/games hierarchy, and games.eclass) should
  be settled by the QA team.

- Motion: "The council encourages the games team to accept join
  requests and elect a lead. In the event they don't elect a lead
  within 6 weeks, we will consider the team as dysfunctional and thus
  disband it."
  Accepted with 6 yes votes and 1 abstention.

- Motion: "The council appoints radhermit as the interim lead of games
  until the elections are held."
  Accepted with 4 yes votes and 3 abstentions.

At this point the meeting was adjourned. The council will continue
with the remaining topics in two weeks.
