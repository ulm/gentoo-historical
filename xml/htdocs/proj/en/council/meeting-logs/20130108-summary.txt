Stable USE masks in the main Portage tree
=========================================
Vote on proposal "Stable USE masks in the main portage tree" by
Michał Górny [1].  There are three suggested approaches:
1) by adding new profiles requiring EAPI=5, requiring all users to
   change, and then deprecating the older profile trees [if chosen; a
   subsequent vote on the timeframes involved will follow]
2) by adding new profiles and using USE-flag masking to keep current
   profiles functional
3) defining use.stable.mask features such that they only apply to EAPI>5
   ebuilds

Note: option 1) requires a decision on the deprecation timeframe.

The council agreed unanimously to vote between the three proposed solutions. 
Solution #1 won with 7 votes.
A remark was made by grobian that BSD and Prefix profiles are unversioned as
noted by the initial email [1] introducing the solutions, and that they need
some care and consideration, best dealt with directly with BSD and Prefix
teams.
The deprecation timeframe for pre-EAPI-5 profiles was voted 6 to 1 to be 1
year.
There was no agreement on whether this is a minimum or maximum of waiting time.
Some even argued that this was a matter of standard deprecation policies.
This period is bound to a possible deprecation of older EAPIs, and influenced
the duration of the timeframe, for some council members to be at least 1 year,
instead of maximum.


Open bugs with council involvement
==================================
Bug 383467 "Council webpage lacks results for 2010 and 2011 elections"
- For bug #383467 to be closed, the master ballots for 2011 & 2012 will
  need to be uploaded & linked.
  jmbsvicetto uploaded some missing data, but the 2012 results and rank 
  are still missing. The bug remains open.


Any Other Business
==================
No issues were raised by council members.

Open Floor
==========
User johu asked who would document the "one year end of support" decision and
where.  The council documents the decision in the summaries, which are
binding.
Zero_Chaos wanted to know the opinion of Council on micro EAPIs, to work
around the relatively high amount of time necessary to complete a full new
EAPI.  The council replied that EAPI features simply should be in PMS, and that
the most work goes in there. Assistance is welcomed.
