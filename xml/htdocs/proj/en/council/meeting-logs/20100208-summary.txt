Agenda

Vote on GLEPs 58 to 61
Open discussion on VDB

GLEPs 58 to 61
==============
GLEPs 58, 59 and 60 were approved unanimously by all present members. GLEP 61
was approved with four votes for it, one against and one abstention.

VDB discussion
==============
The council believes that specifying a unified VDB cache could prevent package
managers from innovating. The council also considers that the use of e.g. a
timestamp to facilitate working (or experimenting) with different VDB caches
is a nice thing, but prefers leaving the decision whether to implement such a
feature to the developers of the package managers.
