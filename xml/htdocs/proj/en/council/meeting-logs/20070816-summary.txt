- clarification on the procedural side of things with transition to new Council:
	* Nominations will always be in the month of July
	* Voting will always be in the month of August
	* August will always be the last month for a new Council
	* New Council will always take over in September
	Delays in misc aspects (like setting up infra to allow voting) will merely
	delay the start of the new Council and the end of the old Council.  Once
	the new Council is voted in and takes over, it will still face the end
	date of August.  This is to avoid ugly sliding windows over time of "Council
	members serve for a year, but they started late on date XXX so we have to
	delay the start of the next Council by XXX days blah blah blah".

  Since this year voting ends after the 2nd Thursday but before the 3rd
  Thursday in September, we'll simply delay the September meeting until the 3rd
  Thursday so that the new Council gets to sit out 12 meetings.

- mailing list changes (wrt new gentoo-dev-announce).  gentoo-dev-announce is
  no longer auto cross-posted to gentoo-dev.  reply munging is no longer in
  effect.  devs can manually cross-post and take discussion to gentoo-dev.

- pms has been moved over to Gentoo infra and will be maintained by the portage
  team and any other interested Gentoo parties.
