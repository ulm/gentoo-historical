    Slacker Arches(bug 234706):
        
        Mark sent a proposal to gentoo-dev about this. No other discussion or
	decision.

    GLEP 55(.ebuild-$eapi extension, bug 234713):
        
        Conclusion:
            This bug has been RESO LATER'ed pending concrete need and
            consensus(GLEP 54 being the main one).

    Code of Conduct Update(Proctors no longer exist, bug 185572):
        
        Conclusion:
            Jorge(jmbsvicetto) will talk to other members of devrel about this
            bug.

    Extent of Code of Conduct enforcement(Banning people entirely from Gentoo,
    bug 234716):

        Conclusion:
            Userrel is responsible for establishing these policies. Since each
            developer is also a user at some point, these policies will apply
            to developers as well as users.

    GLEP 54(-scm package suffix. bug 234711):
    
        Conclusion:
            No decision. David Leverton commented that portage's current
            method for identifying 'live' ebuilds was hackish, as it depends
            on the list of inherited eclasses, which could change. Also, it
	    was pointed out that some ebuilds use scm eclasses to check out
	    specific revisions(mythtv). PROPERTIES=live was considered
            as another option.
