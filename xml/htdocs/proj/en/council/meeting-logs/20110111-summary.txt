New Council Member:
	
	Halcy0n stepped down from the council a few days before this meeting.
	The council unanimously accepted patrick, the next in line, to fill
	the empty seat, with this being his first meeting.


What happened:

#211529 [Future EAPI] have econf run ./configure with
	--disable-dependency-tracking and --enable-fast-install
---------------------------------------------------------------

	As summarized in the bug by Ulrich:

	So, looks like the possible options are:
	1) Only filter the warning for now, and reiterate for EAPI 5,
		as suggested by Petteri in comment #12.
	2) Change the spec as in attached patch.
	3) Call ./configure --help | grep disable-dependency-tracking to
		determine if the option is available (another idea from Diego).
	4) Remove --disable-dependency-tracking from EAPI 4 entirely.

	Petteri expressed some concern about option 3 as it would mean
	changing an approved EAPI version. Brian and Jorge expressed the view
	that the council can just issue a new tag and that EAPI-4 hasn't been
	approved for use yet. No council member supported option 4. Brian and
	Tony noted that option 2 only partially addresses the issue.

	The vote turned out 6 votes for option 3 and 1 [Betelgeuse]
	for option 1.


#322049 use_with 3 arg specification differs in portage for $3='' 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	Jorge asked for a clarification about the proposal to address this
	bug. Brian explained that the purpose is to change EAPI 0 to 3
	definition to state that use_with arg1 arg2 '' can't be  relied upon.
	For EAPI 4 it can be relied on. So in EAPI 0-3, use_with arg1 arg2 ''
	is treated as if there were two args, whilst in EAPI 4 it's treated as
	if there were 3 arguments.

	All council members approved the proposal.


EAPI 4 tree usage approval
--------------------------

	The council members decided to wait for a new portage release that
	will include the above modifications before approving EAPI-4 for tree
	use. Some members expressed the desire to hold the aprroval until said
	portage release is marked stable, but no decision was made. The issue
	will be resolved and approval will be granted via email or at the next
	meeting.


Slacking arches
---------------

	There was some discussion about this issue, but the council members
	decided this needs to be discussed in the -dev ml before the council
	can decide anything about this topic.
