21:07 <@  grobian> did anyone but you show up ulm?
21:09 <@      ulm> nope :(
21:09 <@  grobian> ok, good start then :/
21:10 *** ulm is searching for phone numbers
21:13 < scarabeus> i had a lag
21:13 < scarabeus> sorry
21:13 <@  grobian> ah, cool

21:13 <@      ulm> I've phoned tony
21:13 <@  grobian> and another one
21:14 <@ Chainsaw> Argh.
21:14 <@  grobian> nice!
21:14 <@ Chainsaw> So sorry.
21:15 <@      ulm> Petteri tells me that he can answer stuff by sms only
21:15 <@      ulm> whatever that means
21:15 <@  grobian> lol
21:15 <@  grobian> ok
21:15 < scarabeus> no net i suppose
21:15 < scarabeus> :D
21:15 < scarabeus> so ask him for votes on the items at least :P
21:16 <@  grobian> we basically vote for doing the stuff the same as last term
21:16 <@ Chainsaw> Agreed for second tuesday of every month.
21:16 <@ Chainsaw> That works well for me.
21:16 < scarabeus> wfm too
21:16 <@ Chainsaw> Workflow, that's a yes, it seemed to work well last term.
21:17 <@  grobian> Chainsaw: you're on the agenda now?
21:17 <@  grobian> http://dev.gentoo.org/~grobian/agenda-20120724.txt
21:17 < scarabeus> he is FAST :D
21:17 <@      ulm> only mailbox for dberkholz
21:17 <@ Chainsaw> grobian: Yeah. Just looking what you need votes for.
21:17 <@ Chainsaw> I can do an introduction if anyone doesn't know me of course.
21:17 <@ Chainsaw> (If you haven't all gone "oh it's the anti-systemd dude")
21:17 <@  grobian> ulm: no number either
21:17 <@  grobian> let's give william some more minutes?
21:18 <@  grobian> I think we can do the rest quite quick
21:18 *** Chainsaw nods
21:18 <@      ulm> grobian: four council members are present, so at least we avoid a re-election :-/
21:19 < scarabeus> that would be pretty lame start we can say
21:19 <@  grobian> is there anyone who wants to do chairing in upcoming meetings?
21:19 <@  grobian> ulm: yeah...
21:20 <@      ulm> I could do august or september
21:20 <@ Chainsaw> We need jmbsvicetto and his address book.
21:20 <@ Chainsaw> He seemed to have numbers for everyone.
21:20 <@ Chainsaw> (Although... fair play for knowing my landline number. I didn't give that out much)
21:21 <@  grobian> ulm: I'm likely not available 1th of september, so I'd need replacement for that one
21:22 <@  grobian> so, to conclude: betelgeuse is unavailable at the moment, dberkholz unknown, williamh has no internet
21:22 <@      ulm> Chainsaw: I have this ...18 number from you and another ...15 (work?)
21:22 <@ Chainsaw> ulm: Yeah, both work numbers end in 15.
21:23 <@ Chainsaw> ulm: And 18 is the landline I actually use. There's another, but I need an Asterisk server before I can use that in earnest.
21:23 <@  grobian> shall we just start?
21:24 <@ Chainsaw> Could wait 6 more minutes and start 20:30?
21:24 <@  grobian> sure
21:24 <@  grobian> let's do that
21:25 <@      ulm> yes, let's give williamh a few more minutes
21:25 <@  grobian> would be nice indeed, he's the real newbee, if I'm not mistaken
21:27 <@      ulm> grobian: above, by "1th of september" you mean 11th?
21:27 <@  grobian> yeah
21:27 <@  grobian> sorry
21:27 <@      ulm> I could take the chair for that one
21:28 <@  grobian> next dates are 14th August, 11th September, 9th October, 13th November, 11th December
21:28 <@  grobian> as it looks now, I could take them all, except september
21:28 <@  grobian> that should give a proper start
21:29 <@  grobian> so we can reevaluate next year
21:30 <@      ulm> shouldn't we rotate the chair as we used to do?
21:30 <@      ulm> grobian: not that I would mind you doing all the work ;-)
21:30 <@  grobian> I suggested to have a couple in a line, because that makes it easier
21:30 < scarabeus> i think it is better to have one guy do it or switch them after few
21:30 <@  grobian> I think it's easier to fo it properly
21:30 <@  grobian> easier to do it proper if you do it a couple of times in a row
21:31 <@  grobian> I think four should be ok
21:32 <@  grobian> ok, let's start?
21:33 <@ Chainsaw> Okay, go.
21:33 <@      ulm> yep
21:33 <@  grobian> scarabeus: do you want an introduction?
21:33 <@  grobian> see agenda http://dev.gentoo.org/~grobian/agenda-20120724.txt
21:33 < scarabeus> nah
21:33 < scarabeus> i was already council :-)
21:34 <@  grobian> ok, is there anyone that wants to say something, announce some goals or whatelse?
21:34 <@ Chainsaw> I aim to keep breakage out of the tree where I can.
21:34 <@ Chainsaw> And stand up for those that run production servers on Gentoo.
21:35 <@ Chainsaw> (My dislike of overlays & systemd remains firmly in place, yes)
21:35 <@  grobian> lol
21:35 <@  grobian> ok, so we can finish the introduction thing, right?
21:35 <@ Chainsaw> Think so, unless you want my life story?
21:35 <@  grobian> nope
21:36 <@  grobian> please
21:36 <@  grobian> no!
21:36 <@  grobian> ok, I'd like some quick votes now
21:36 <@ Chainsaw> Aw, and I had the full powerpoint loaded up.
21:36 <@ Chainsaw> Okay then.
21:36 <@ Chainsaw> Second tuesday of every month? In favour!
21:36 < scarabeus> '+1
21:36 <@      ulm> yes
21:36 <@  grobian> please vote for 2nd tuesday, 19:00 UTC
21:37 <@ Chainsaw> grobian: I vote yes.
21:37 <@  grobian> brilliant
21:37 <@      ulm> betelgeuse has texted to me that 19 UTC is fine for him on every day
21:38 <@  grobian> ok, now please vote for sending call for agenda 2 weeks in advance, agenda 1 week, and (new) the summary afterwards to -project
21:38 <@ Chainsaw> grobian: Yes on workflow.
21:38 <@      ulm> yes
21:38 < scarabeus> +1
21:38 <@  grobian> do we all agree, we include betelgeuse via sms/text?
21:38 < scarabeus> it is fine if it does not violate the glep
21:38 <@  grobian> questionable
21:39 <@  grobian> ok, sorry, back to the workflow vote
21:39 <@ Chainsaw> I don't think it says anything about an attendee also proxying.
21:39 <@  grobian> ok workflow: all yes
21:39 *** ulm is not sure if he can actually follow
21:39 <@  grobian> let me restart
21:39 <@      ulm> s/he/betelgeuse/
21:39 <@  grobian> ah
21:39 <@ Chainsaw> Yes, from scratch. Introductions?
21:40 <@  grobian> Chainsaw: NO! I won't let you do your powerpoint thing!
21:40 <@  grobian> Chainsaw: :P
21:40 <@ Chainsaw> Aw :(
21:40 < scarabeus> "Hello, I am Tom and I am adddicted to..."
21:40 <@  grobian> sorry guys
21:40 <@  grobian> back to votes
21:40 <@  grobian> I recorded betelgeuse's vote vor 2nd tuesdays
21:40 <@  grobian> I have 4 votes in favour for the workflow
21:41 <@  grobian> so what's left is the chairing, I volunteered to do the first bit
21:41 <@  grobian> result is in the updated agenda
21:41 <@  grobian> is that ok with you?
21:42 < scarabeus> yup enjoy your post
21:42 <@      ulm> fine
21:42 < scarabeus> next chair should be picked on your last one
21:43 <@  grobian> Chainsaw: ?
21:44 <@ Chainsaw> grobian: I am fine with you chairing meetings. You seem quite good at it :)
21:44 <@  grobian> thank you for the trust :)
21:44 <@  grobian> ok, can we conclude this topic then?
21:44 <@ Chainsaw> By all means. Do we have any open bugs left?
21:44 <@  grobian> I thought we closed
21:44 <@      ulm> who's going to update the list of chairs on the council's web page?
21:44 <@  grobian> but I'd have to check
21:45 <@      ulm> bug 383467 is still open
21:45 < willikins> ulm: https://bugs.gentoo.org/383467 "Council webpage lacks results for 2010 and 2011 elections"; Website www.gentoo.org, Projects; CONF; hwoarang:jmbsvicetto
21:45 <@  grobian> I suggest we go through the normal cycle of bugs and open issues at next meeting
21:46 <@  grobian> ulm: I'll update it
21:46 <@      ulm> good
21:46 <@      ulm> it's currently commented out in the xml source
21:46 <@  grobian> saw that
21:47 <@  grobian> ok, open floor, anyone wants to raise some issue?
21:47 <@ Chainsaw> Not everyone at once please.
21:47 < scarabeus> (that apply to you non-council guys too)
21:47 < scarabeus> :P
21:47 <@ Chainsaw> Form an orderly queue. The microphone is now on.
21:48 <@  grobian> ok, gentlemen
21:48 <@  grobian> please reload the agenda once again, and tell me if you agree with its contents
21:49 <@  grobian> then I'll shoot it in right away
21:49 <@ Chainsaw> I'm mentioned. Neat!
21:49 < scarabeus> Chainsaw: be happy there aint no photos
21:49 <@ Chainsaw> scarabeus: Probably for the best.
21:49 <@  grobian> Chainsaw: I removed the "the chair denied Chainsaw to present his life by powerpoint slides"
21:49 <@ Chainsaw> grobian: Approved as a true record of what was discussed.
21:49 <@ Chainsaw> grobian: Your loss.
21:50 <@      ulm> grobian: agenda is fine
21:50 < scarabeus> grobian: it is perfect
21:50 <@  grobian> very nice
21:50 <@  grobian> then thank you all for being here
