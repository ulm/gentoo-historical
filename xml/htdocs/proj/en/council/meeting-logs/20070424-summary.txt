A subset of council members decided today that multiple version suffixes 
are illegal in the tree pending further notice. This decission can be 
appealed at the next Council meeting. If there is sufficient public 
demand, an earlier meeting can be held.

This decission has been made to prevent sufficient precedence for 
unilateral changes to the tree structure. So far the following package 
versions are considered illegal:

  media-viode/mplayer-1.0_rc2_pre20070321-r4
  media-video/transcode-1.0.3_rc2_p20070310-r1

An illegal version specification of media-sound/alsa-driver has already 
been removed from the tree.

I would like to ask the affected package maintainers to move these 
versions to sane version specifications as soon as possible. Thanks in 
advance for this.
