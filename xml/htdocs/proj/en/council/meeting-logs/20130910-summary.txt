Install functions, default src_install
======================================
Two votes were taken:

Calling the do*() install commands without a filename parameter is
an error. Vote for approval of updated PMS wording, as in ref. [2].
- Accepted unanimously (6 yes votes).

Retroactively change default src_install() in EAPIs 4 and 5 such
that the DOCS variable is allowed to be empty.  Vote for approval
of updated PMS wording, as in ref. [3].
- Rejected with 4 no votes and 2 abstentions.

einstalldocs() pre-approval for next EAPI
=========================================
mgorny shortly presented the einstalldocs() function proposed for
EAPI 6. The purpose of this is to split off the doc-install part from
default src_install and make it available to ebuilds as a function.
For existing EAPIs, a function of the same name would be added to
eutils.eclass. Vote for approval of the einstalldocs() implementation,
as shown in Ref. [5].
- Accepted unanimously (6 yes votes).

(Note added in proof: The implementation should use double quotes
instead of single quotes around "declare -a" [17].)

Minor architectures stabilisation policy
========================================
The council was asked to vote if alpha, ia64, m68k, s390, sh, and
sparc should be dropped to unstable keywords. Alternatively, only the
packages pulled in by the system set could be stable for these
architectures. In the council's discussion it was argued that arch
testing is a lot of work and that some arch teams cannot keep up.
It was also pointed out that dropping keywords to unstable is an
action that is hard to revert, because restoring a consistent stable
dependency tree will require retesting of many packages.
- Decision deferred to next meeting.

Specification of /var/db/pkg contents
=====================================
The council discussed if the contents of the VDB should be specified
for interoperability between utilities, either in the PMS or possibly
in a separate document. Alternatively, package managers could provide
an abstraction layer to make some of the VDB's information available.
Finally, the following vote was taken:
"The council recommends that package managers export the NEEDED.ELF.2
information for interoperability between utilities."
- Accepted with 6 yes votes and 1 abstention.

[At this point, time had passed the one hour that was allocated for
the meeting. Therefore, agenda topics 6 to 8 were skipped and another
meeting was scheduled for the following week.]

Open floor
==========
No issues were brought up to the council.

Next meeting date

17 September 2013, 19:00 UTC
