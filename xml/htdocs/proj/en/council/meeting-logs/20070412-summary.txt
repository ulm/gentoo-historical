CoC:
	- amne has been doing a good job putting the group together
	- ask proctors to address these two issues for next meeting:
		- add a "mission" statement
		- fix wording to have a positive spin
sync Social Contract with Gentoo Foundation (external entities):
	- trustees will review the statement to clarify things and then
	  we'll look again at syncing
documentation for mail servers:
	- they are supposed to be finished in terms of content
	- wolf will look at getting them actually committed
PMS:
	- current status looks good in getting issues resolved
	- should be up and running on Gentoo infra by next meeting
	- let the devs sort out the todo as the current work flow seems
	  to be getting things done finally
splitting gentoo-dev mailing lists:
	- no real favorable backing for this
	- people dont like -dev because of the crap, splitting the lists
	  will just move the crap else where, not really solving anything
	- let proctors do their thing and if need be, review this again
limiting of council powers:
	- doesnt seem to be real backing for this from dev community or
	  the council itself
	- if a majority of developers are truly upset/disturbed by a
	  council decision, it should show easily
	- if you dont like a council member, dont vote for them next time
moving gentoo-core to public archives:
	- many people dislike this moving forward
	- use -dev over -core for most things
	- not going to happen at this time
	- look into getting a dev-only archive finally
surveys:
	- robbat2 will look at getting user/dev surveys in place after the
	  release of 2007.0
	- probably try and take fresh surveys after each bi-annual release
	  from now on to see if we're meeting many of users' desires
new metastructure proposal:
	- doesnt seem to address any of the problems it proposes to
	- a large majority of developers and users prefer the single tree
	  development style that Gentoo has versus many smaller trees
