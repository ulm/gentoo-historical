- Council noted the lack of pre-prepared agenda items, and tried to see what
  outsanding issues from previous months were still running. jaervosz and
  vapier were marked as slackers for non-attendance.

- On the Musikc's proposal from the June meeting that was to be assembled and
  discussed by proctors, no progress had been made due to real-life issues and
  timing conflicts. The previously existing document was not agreed upon by
  existing proctors either.

- The issues of -project, and moderation of email were brought up the
  counterproposal to the proctors, as they had been discussed in the June 2007
  meeting.

- Kingtaco wanted a vote to cancel the proctors. robbat2 wanted them to just
  die quietly if no material was forthcoming. Others called for a definate
  stand rather than the "die quietly". All 5 attending council members voted
  in favour of dropping the proctors.

- More discussion was put into the -project and moderation issue and the state
  of proctors.

- nightmorph aske the council questions about how much time council work takes
  up and the like.
