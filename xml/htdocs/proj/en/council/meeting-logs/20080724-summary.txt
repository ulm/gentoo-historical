== Quick summary ==

Item 1: userrel authority: Does userrel have the ability to enforce the
        CoC on users like devrel does for developers?

It was decided that userrel does have this authority.


Item 2: coc extent

All council members will review the CoC thread and comment on it by the
next meeting (7 August 2008).  We will get a status update in that
meeting to see if we can vote on any of the proposals brought up in that
thread.
