Discussion of GLEP39, "unresponsive projects" / "unresponsive project leads"
=========

It was brought up what to do if a project and / or its lead are unresponsive, 
in particular if someone wants to co-maintain and help out but e.g. never gets
a response to e-mails. The specific case in question was toolchain maintenance.

The consensus was that developers should apply for project membership, and if
no response at all comes within a reasonable timeframe, be bold, add themselves 
to the project, and start contributing in a resposible and careful way. This 
explicitly also applies to central projects such as toolchain.


Policy for long-term package masks (10 minutes) 
=========

The question was brought up whether packages can remain masked for an indefinite
time, e.g. due to QA or security issues, or whether they have to be removed 
after some time.

After discussion, the following motions were passed: 
"Packages with security vulnerabilities may remain in tree package-masked for 
indefinite time, assuming there are no replacements for them and they have 
active maintainers." (5 yes, 2 no)
"The security issue must be documented in the mask message, with bug number."
(6 yes)


Bug 523828 "GLEP 42 update: Unify gentoo-news repo and rsync structure"
=========

Nothing left to do for the council, removed from CC list.


Open Floor
=========

Discussion regarding long-term masked games ensued. A suggestion was to start
last-rites procedures in selected cases- if noone steps up and / or
protests with good arguments, then the game is unmaintained and can be removed.
