    - Migration of KEYWORDS out of ebuilds
        There was initial discussion on this idea. The council requested that
        Ned Ludd(solar) post a draft proposal of his idea to one of the lists
        for discussion, since the idea interested the council and they wish to
        get an idea of its pros and cons.

    - EAPI 3 features block
        To make sure that there is enough discussion on all EAPI 3 features a
        block on new features for consideration into EAPI 3 was considered. A 
        vote was taken to
            A) block features to those already discussed
            B) 'A' with mtime preservation
            C) no block for features
        Choice 'A' won with 4 votes.
        This block doesn't affect discussion of the implementation of the
        features, only new features.

    - EAPI 3 updates
        Zac Medico(zmedico) commented that while he hadn't worked on
        [use(+/-)] yet it shouldn't take more than a week or two to complete.
