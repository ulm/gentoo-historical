- Discussion of need to announce somewhere the stabilization of "critical"
  packages (like baselayout).  Critical packages should be announced on
  gentoo-dev (and gentoo-user) until GLEP 42 is put into place.  When
  appropriate, an upgrade guide should be put together with the docs team.
  In all cases, "critical" is determined by common sense.
