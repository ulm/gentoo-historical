Summary of Gentoo council meeting 9 September 2014

Agenda
======
1. Roll call (5 minutes)
2. Future of dohtml [1] (15 minutes)
3. Open bugs with council involvement (5 minutes)
4. Open floor


Roll call
=========
Present:
blueness, dberkholz, dilfridge, radhermit, rich0, ulm, williamh

Future of dohtml
================
Three votes were taken:

- Should dohtml be banned from the package manager?
  Accepted unanimously.

- Should dohtml be banned in EAPI 6 already?
  Rejected (tie vote, 3 yes, 3 no, 1 abstention).

- Deprecate dohtml now, ban it in EAPI 7?
  Accepted (6 yes, 1 no).

The council notes as an obvious implication that the einstalldocs
function in EAPI 6 must not use dohtml, but dodoc -r.

There is consensus that dodoc -r should be recommended as replacement.
The council remains silent about the issue if a substitute in an
eclass will be needed.

Open bugs with council involvement
==================================
- Bug 503382 "Missing summaries for 20131210, 20140114, and 20140225
  council meetings" [2]
  The summaries for the 20131210 and 20140114 meetings are done, but
  20140225 is still missing.

Open floor
==========
blueness intends having GLEP 64 ready for a vote in the next meeting.

Next meeting date
