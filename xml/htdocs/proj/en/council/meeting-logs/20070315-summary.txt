Summary of special council meeting 2007/March/15, for the Gentoo CoC
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* wolf31o2 posted a temporary version to his devspace, containing suggestions
  and clarifications from the Q&A session.

* vapier has some further modifications, including: 
- dropping the all caps to regular case text (accepted)
- rewording of wanting everybody to be ready to apologize to rather taking
  responsibility for your actions (accepted)
- wanting to involve the ombudsman in the consequences section (not accepted,
  as the ombudsman is for inter-developer conflict).

* robbat2 brought up a set of five conditions to apply to the CoC, given the
  other input on the mailing lists and the Q&A session.
- Conditions #1 (that the document is fluid) and #5 (that council may not be
  proctors) were added directly to the CoC.
- Conditions #2 (working on a more final version) and #4 (regular review of
  proctor actions by the council) were included in the vote.
- Condition #3 (to find a better name than proctors) was not agreed upon, as
  it was realized that no single title would ever fit.

* The motion was called for accepted the CoC with the above modifications, as
  well as revisiting it next council meeting, and reviewing the actions of
  proctors during every council meeting.
- Passed 6 votes for yes, and 1 for abstain (vapier).

* There was an initial discussion about who the initial group of proctors, are
  and kloeri and kingtaco agreed to work together on finding them. wolf31o2 and
  kugelfang were too busy with their work in the 2007.0 release to get involved
  there.
- seemant and g2boojum were mentioned as potential initial candidates,
  combined with the forums moderators and the #gentoo ops focusing on their own
  areas of specialization.

* robbat2 is working on the implementation of mailing-list stuff from the
  infrastructure side, linking his implementation plan, and asked for any
  short-term needs to be brought to him directly until the initial application
  is ready to go in a few hours.
