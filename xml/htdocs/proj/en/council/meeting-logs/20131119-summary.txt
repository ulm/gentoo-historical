Roll call
=========

Present:
   blueness, dberkholz, dilfridge, rich0, scarabeus, ulm, williamh



Request for a minimal policy for pgp keys and key handling (for commit 
   signing) [2,3,4]
======================================================================

After some discussion about details (e.g. the merits of a key expiration date
and the functionality of key revocation certificates) the following resulution
was accepted unanimously:

"We appreciate the GLEP draft submitted by robbat2 in above mailing list post 
[4], and look forward to approving a final version with additional minor changes 
merged in."



Removing last keyworded package version for a minor arch [5]
============================================================

The proposal by rich0 in [5] was accepted unanimously. The modified rule now 
reads:

"If a maintainer has an open STABLEREQ, or a KEYWORDREQ blocking a
pending STABLEREQ, for 90 days with archs CCed and otherwise ready
to be stabilized, the maintainer can remove older versions of
the package at their discretion. A package is considered ready to be
stabilized if it has been in the tree for 30 days, and has no known
major flaws on arches that upstream considers supported."



Metastructure: Dead projects [6,7]
==================================

For all three projects listed in the e-mail (Kolab, GSE, Gentoo/Alt AT) the 
following resolution was passed with 6 yes votes:

"Remove the project web page, and if noone cares, all is done."



Metastructure: Reorganization of the project tree [8,9]
=======================================================

Consensus was that such and similar changes should rather be made in small steps
and make more sense once the migration of the project pages to the wiki is 
complete. No action was taken.



Modernization/adaption of the Code of Conduct, the return [10]
==============================================================

A minimally modernized version of the CoC page "Consequences" section was 
presented by dilfridge. Consensus was that - since this is a sensitive area -
the text will be sent to the project mailing list for discussion and decided
in the next council meeting. 



Revival of archives.gentoo.org [11]
===================================

The current technical problems with archives.gentoo.org were discussed, and the 
council was CCed to bug 424647. No further action was taken.



Open bugs with council involvement
==================================

* Bug 477030 - Missing summary for 20130611 council meeting [12]
  Consensus is to continue annoying betelgeuse for that.



Open floor
==========

TomWij remarks that some documentation changes or clarifications are pending and 
will be brought up in a future meeting, regarding:
* new project to be filed on wiki, authors not marked as retired, ...
* KEYWORD="" and/or package.mask
