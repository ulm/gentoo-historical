1. Roll call
============

Present: blueness, dberkholz, rich0, scarabeus, ulm
Absent: dilfridge, williamh


2. Package Default USE Flags / Security
=========================================================================

The council discussed default USE flags, in-particular including those
of openssl and openssh [1 and 2].  The council felt that this should be
left to the maintainer's discretion.

 "Per existing policy, the council leaves the default USE flags to the
 discretion of the maintainer, but encourages following upstream when
 there is no reason to do otherwise."

Aye: dberkholz, rich0, scarabeus, ulm
Not present for vote: blueness

3. Non-upstream pkg-config
=========================================================================

The council felt unanimously that an outright ban on non-upstream
pkg-config files was inappropriate.  It was felt that any sensible
policy would leave it to the maintainer's discretion.  The exact wording
of the recommendations was deferred to the lists/etc.

 "The council agrees to revise the devmanual policy regarding pkg-config
 files to set guidelines for non-upstream pkg-config files but to leave
 the inclusion up to the maintainer's discretion.  Wording will be
 worked out following the meeting, and in the meantime the changes
 introduced in bug 445130 will be reverted."

Aye: blueness, dberkholz, rich0, scarabeus, ulm


4. Bugs assigned to Council
===========================

Bugs 503382 and 477030 are for missing summaries - those responsible are
reminded to write them up.

Bug 498332 was discussed and it was not felt that it was necessary for
Council to remain CC'ed.  A note to this effect will be posted on the
bug by rich0.


5. Open floor
=============

No issues were brought forward.
