Bug 523828: GLEP 42 update: Unify gentoo-news repo and rsync structure
=========

Noone voiced any opposition to the proposed change (dropping the year subdirectory
from gentoo-news.git); consensus was to go ahead with it. No formal vote was taken.


Open Floor
=========

Michal Gorny brought up the topic of metadata.xml reorganization, which led to 
a lengthy discussion. No formal decision was taken, but a lot of ideas were 
collected for a future elegant and simplified replacement proposal (including 
e.g. using yaml or moving a default e-mail domain of maintainer addresses to 
layout.conf).

It was brought up that the QA team lead election is due.

The question was brought up whether helper functions were ever banned officially 
in global scope. Conclusion was that a) it's been banned from the start in PMS, 
and b) QA has decided already to explicitly make global-scope 'use*', 
'has_version' and 'best_version' fatal since EAPI 6. No action by the council 
needed, only by the portage team.
