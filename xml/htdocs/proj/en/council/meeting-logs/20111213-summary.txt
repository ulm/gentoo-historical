"Sighted pages" in the Gentoo wiki
==================================
Discuss/vote: Is this a council issue at the moment? [1]

The Council aggreed unanimously that this is not an issue for the
Council at the moment.  The issue not yet clear, which makes it hard to
form an opinion on the subject, which is believed to be more of an issue
of the wiki team.
The Council advises to take up the issue with the wiki team.  For this
case, it seems that the Council should only get involved through the
normal escalation procedures, as last resort.

In a side remark, the Council suggests using the term "reviewed pages",
which seems to express more clearly what the pages are about.


Quiet build default in Portage
==============================
Discuss/vote: Should the quiet default get reverted before affected
Portage versions get stabilised? [2]

The Council agreed that quiet-build behaviour of Portage should be made
an opt-in for existing installs (chainsaw, jmbsvicetto, grobian).  The
suggested implementation for this is by reverting the default of
quiet-build.
Indifferent to the value of this default for existing installs:
dberkholz, ulm, betelgeuse.

The Council agreed that quiet-build behaviour of Portage can be made the
default for new installs (dberkholz, betelgeuse, jmbsvicetto, chainsaw,
grobian).  A possible implementation for this suggested by jmbsvicetto
is via the stage building process (catalyst) to enable quiet-build in
the produced make.conf.
Indifferent to the value of this default for new installs: ulm.

The Council likes to note that the quiet-build option in itself seems
unknown to many, and hence leads to people searching for long how to
change it.  Some pointers to documentation may be necessary.  As
understood, a GLEP 42 news item is already planned.  Another way of
getting it better documented would be to add it commented out to
make.conf.
