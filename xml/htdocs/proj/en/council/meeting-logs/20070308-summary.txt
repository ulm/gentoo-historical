- Flameeyes has retired from Gentoo so Uberlord was put into place in
  accordance with the GLEP changes from last month.

- The Package Manager Spec (PMS) posted by spb looks like a good first
  draft.  It will be opened up to the public before next council meeting
  and we'll review the status again at that time.

- The current state of Gentoo's public communication was reviewed.  The
  frequent fighting among people and irrelevant technical related public
  posts are disheartening.  Devrel was charged with revamping our current
  nettiquette documents and policies for getting people to play nice in the
  cases where they refuse to and to report back the status next meeting.
  Council members also agreed to lead by example by taking g2boojum's example.

- We've expanded the Council GLEP slightly:
 * Two Council members may (together) make executive decisions which carry the
   weight of the full Council.  Upon making such a decision, the Gentoo Council
   mailing list must be notified.  At the next meeting, it must also be noted.
   Any disagreement from the Gentoo community will be taken to the full Gentoo
   Council.

- The tr1 issue will be resolved in the short term by new-style virtuals.  As
  packages need them, they should create them.  Long term, when a sane tr1
  implementation arises (most likely from GCC itself), the virtuals will be
  reviewed and probably dissolved.

- The topic of splitting the gentoo-dev mailing list up will be punted to the
  next month's meeting.

- Gentoo branded hardware was discussed and many ideas thrown about.  This also
  touched on the concept of "Enterprise Gentoo".
