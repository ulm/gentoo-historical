EAPI 5 features
===============
The council voted on the list of EAPI 5 features. A detailed list was
sent to the gentoo-project mailing list before the meeting:
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.project/2140>

Chainsaw remarked that in future a short plain text summary for each
item should be provided.

 * Slot operator dependencies (bug 229521)
 * Sub-slots (bug 424429)
 * Profile IUSE injection (bug 176467)
 * At-most-one-of operator for REQUIRED_USE (bug 354219)
 * EBUILD_PHASE_FUNC variable (bug 390765)

 * econf --disable-silent-rules (bug 379497)

   - Accepted unanimously for EAPI 5.
   - Rejected applying it retroactively to EAPI 4 (0 yes, 4 no, 1 abstain).
     Therefore, no vote necessary for EAPIs 0 to 3.

   - Rejected unanimously for EAPI 5.
   - Several council members remarked that this is a controversial
     feature and that it should at least be postponed to a later EAPI.
