Issues discussed:
- Removal of icons from http://www.gentoo.org due to possible licensing
  issues. The issue ended up being refered to Trustees who decided to
  remove the icons.
- Status of documentation on Reply-To and SPF. This isn't finished yet
  but is expected do be done soon.
- Status on bugstest / bugs.gentoo.org. There's still a couple minor
  issues that needs to be fixed but Robin Johnson (robbat2) hope we can
  switch over to bugstest 23 dec.
- Short discussion about what's happening in the QA project.
