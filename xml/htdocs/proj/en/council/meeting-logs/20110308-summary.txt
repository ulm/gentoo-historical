Agenda
------

* Preffering latest EAPI in ebuilds
This change should encourage developers to migrate their ebuilds to latest
rather than sticking to old EAPIs.
Devmanual EAPI section will be update where the text appended to it is:
"When writing new ebuilds developers can choose whathever EAPI they think is the
best. Using the features of the latest EAPI is encouraged."
- Accepted by 6 ack votes (patrick, did not vote).

* slacking arches
Ongoing discussion with arches is getting us somewhere and given the fact we
have now some knowledge of what issues we are standing up to the rest of talks
should move to -project ml so wider audience can participate.
Common so far identified issues are developers burnout and lack of hardware,
where Jorge (jmbsvicetto) is now coordinating between foundation/infra/archteams
to get desired stuff.

* GLEP 48 (QA)
After long discussion and bit of text altering finals result for this thing are:
- vote:
	in favor: scarabeus, ferringb, wired, jmbsvicetto
	didn't state (abstain): betlegeuse, patrick, a3li
Given the state the GLEP update is accepted and can proceed, albeit Peteri
poited out question how Devrel is going to work out the resolution after handled
from QA, where it was agreed that the part of the text (last sentence of the
diff) will be updated with string based on what those two teams agree with
without more council involvment (unless required otherwise).

* open bugs with council involvement
Only relevant bug is https://bugs.gentoo.org/344479.
Brian (ferringb) is going to look to it and resolve it (given the fact the bug
is about him so he should do it :))

* next meeting date / chair
Date to be decided on mail, Alex (wired) will sent the mail about it.
Chair will be Jorge (jmbsvicetto)

* open floor - listen to the community
They were really really quiet. Nobody wanted icecream.
