- Review of GLEP 41 (Making Arch Testers official Gentoo Staff).  It was
  rejected due to the following criticisms:
   * AT's should get an e-mail address on a subdomain (user@xxx.gentoo.org)
   * AT's should get r/o access to livecvs
   * a longer probation period to make sure they know their way around
   * either they get same privileges as current "staff", or they get a new
     classification other than "staff" or "dev" (voting, access to resources,
     etc...)
