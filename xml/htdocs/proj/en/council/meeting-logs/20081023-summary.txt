Running through open bugs
=========================

Process: For each bug, come up with a concrete next step and who's going 
to do it. If it's the council, a specific member should take 
responsibility. The bug should be assigned to whoever needs to take the 
next step and council@ should be in CC.

Bugs handled:
185572 - As the proctors no longer exist the code of conduct needs an upate
234705 - Document of being an active developer
234706 - Slacker arches
234708 - Can the council help fewer bugs get ignored by arm/sh/s390 teams?
234710 - as-needed by default
237381 - Document appeals process

Bugs remaining:
234711 - GLEP 54: scm package version suffix
234713 - GLEP 55: Use EAPI-suffixed ebuilds (.ebuild-EAPI)
234716 - Extent of Code of Conduct enforcement

Meeting scheduling conflicts
============================ 
The 2nd meetings in November and December 
conflict with holidays. If there are open bugs, we will hold them on the 
3rd Thursday instead of the 4th Thursday; otherwise, they will be 
canceled.
