Roll call
============

Present: blueness, dilfridge, rich0, williamh
Absent: dberkholz, scarabeus, ulm


IUSE_RUNTIME / GLEP 62
======================

See the logs for full discussion.

There will likely be a need for some bikeshedding on the lists as it
comes time to implement this, as we set guidelines on when this feature
should be used.

"The council accepts IUSE_RUNTIME for implementation in EAPI6 as
outlined in GLEP 62.  The actual GLEP will be approved when EAPI6 is
approved as part of PMS."

Aye: blueness, dilfridge, rich0, williamh
Passed


Bugs assigned to Council
========================

dberkholz and betelgeuse are reminded to upload their summaries and link
on the council page.


Open floor
==========

Only item brought up was general celebration that our term is finally
ended, and those of us who return are looking forward to it!
