In today's meeting, the QA-team GLEP (48) was brought into the field. 
The GLEP discusses the role of the QA team and its powers and was accepted
by the gentoo-dev participants with little to no objections. The council 
therefore had only a few questions (can a single QA member act - yes, does
it only work on the tree or on documentation too - tree currently) and 
accepted the GLEP for execution by 5 votes and 1 abstained.
