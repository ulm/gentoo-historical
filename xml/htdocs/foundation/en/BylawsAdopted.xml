Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed 
action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the 
right of the foundation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or member of the 
foundation, or is or was serving at the request of the foundation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of 
another foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification against 
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgements, fines, and amounts paid in settlement to the fullest extent now or 
hereafter permitted by applicable law as long as such person acted in good faith and in a manner that such person 
reasonably believed to be in or not be opposed to the best interests of the foundation; provided, however, that the 
foundation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding 
(or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized 
by the Board of Trustees.

<title>Section 12.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.</title>
<body>

<p>
Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any person who is or was an officer, director or 
member of the foundation, or who is or was serving at the request of the foundation as an officer or director of 
another foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in defending any civil, criminal, 
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the foundation in advance of the final 
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person 
to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled under applicable law to be 
indemnified by the foundation.

<title>Section 12.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit</title>
<body>

<p>
If a claim under this Article is not paid in full by the foundation within ninety (90) days after a written claim 
has been received by the foundation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the foundation 
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to 
be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defence to any such action (other than an action 
brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final 
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the foundation unless such action is based on 
the claimant having committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not met the standards of 
conduct which make indemnification permissible under the General Foundation Law of the State of New Mexico, 
but the burden of proving such defence shall be on the foundation. Neither the failure of the foundation 
(including its Board of Trustees, independent legal counsel, or its members) to have made a determination prior 
to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because 
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the law of the State of New Mexico, nor an 
actual determination by the foundation (including its Board of Trustees, independent legal counsel, or its members) 
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defence to the action or create a 
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
