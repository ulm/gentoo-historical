<title>Requests for Funds, Project Support, or Equipment</title>
<body>

<p>
Requests for funds, project support, or equipment need to be sent to the
Foundation in the form of a proposal. This proposal is to inform all trustees of
the need (not all of them will be aware of the need or the background of the
situation). The proposal process will also help to maintain a trusting
relationship between the Foundation and it's donors. Donors know and expect that
without exception money will only be spent after a proposal and vote by the
Board of Trustees. Additionally, the proposals will be archived to provide
accountability for money spent.

<title>Project Funding Support</title>
<body>

<p>
Any 'special project support' request must  be approved by a majority vote from
the Board of Trustees. They will discuss how the request fits in to the
financial needs of Gentoo and whether or not the request is appropriate to
fulfill at the time. If chosen for support, a contract will be issued and must
be signed by an individual at the entity receiving funds (where applicable) that
has the authority to sign official legal documents. The contract will contain
terms of use, funding requirements, and reporting requirements (pursuant to the
proposal submitted where applicable) and will serve as the legally binding
document of both entities in the event of funding.

<section>
<title>Distributing Funds</title>
<body>

<p>
In the case that funds will be distributed, in addition to reporting
requirements, receipts will need to be turned in within 2 weeks of the purchase.
The address to send the receipts to can be obtained by mailing the Board of
Trustees. This MUST be done for tax purposes. Failure to do so will jeopardize
the acceptance of future proposals from you or your team. Any excess funds (not
utilized for the project) will need to be returned along with the receipts from
items purchased.
