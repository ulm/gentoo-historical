<b>Meeting Conduct</b>
</p>

<p>
The channel will be open (not moderated) during the meeting unless there is so much chatter it becomes impossible to 
make progress.
</p>
<p>
Attendees can help by keeping questions to the end of an agenda item or the end of the meeting - your 
point may be covered during the discussion anyway.
</p>
<p>
Do not expect to bring up items in Any Other Business and get an instant response. Calm considered well 
reasoned emails to <mail link="trustees@gentoo.org">the trustees</mail> or opening a bug are the best ways 
to bring up new ideas.
</p>

<p>
<b>Record Keeping</b>
</p>

<p>
The meeting will be logged and both the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/minutes/">full log and a summary</uri> 
 of decisions will be made publicaly available
