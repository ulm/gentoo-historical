Nov 15 11:15:52 tsunam	Q1 2010, we had income of 1901.57. Of which 1833.28 came in paypal donations and 68.29 in interest
Nov 15 11:16:02 NeddySeagoon	2010 ?

Nov 15 11:16:37 tsunam	yes...
Nov 15 11:16:43 *	tsunam bonks NeddySeagoon 
Nov 15 11:16:49 quantumsummers	that is solid income
Nov 15 11:17:25 tsunam	expenses for q1 were 2151.59 for events, (500 for donation in ferris's name) and the 1651.59 for travel expenses for SOC
Nov 15 11:17:37 NeddySeagoon	anything from the Gentoo store ?
Nov 15 11:17:44 tsunam	nope
Nov 15 11:17:55 tsunam	have not transfered any funds from the store in a while
Nov 15 11:17:59 tsunam	I will talk with musikc about that
Nov 15 11:18:12 tsunam	we also purchased a Efika MX this quarter
Nov 15 11:18:35 tsunam	the SOC expenses will be reimbursed by Google soon
Nov 15 11:18:47 quantumsummers	indeed, when can we expect the reimburse?
Nov 15 11:19:06 tsunam	I need to confirm with donnie
Nov 15 11:19:30 quantumsummers	also I talked with donnie & he spoke with the gsoc coordinator about back payment to gentoo
Nov 15 11:19:46 quantumsummers	he stated they were amenable to settling up
Nov 15 11:19:55 quantumsummers	which would be quite nice
Nov 15 11:20:06 tsunam	*nods*
Nov 15 11:20:16 tsunam	that covers my report
Nov 15 11:20:17 quantumsummers	tsunam: please ask him about that when you chat with him.
Nov 15 11:20:22 quantumsummers	how about  report for fy09
Nov 15 11:20:40 tsunam	though I'd given the full year report last month
Nov 15 11:21:04 NeddySeagoon	and even 2008 ... or was that completed while I wasn't paying attention?
Nov 15 11:21:45 tsunam	I've not made anything for full years on the sites yet. As the requirements are to report quarterly
Nov 15 11:21:49 tsunam	as a NFP
Nov 15 11:21:58 NeddySeagoon	ok
Nov 15 11:21:59 tsunam	yearly would only be for us if really wanted/needed
Nov 15 11:22:37 quantumsummers	ok
Nov 15 11:22:38 NeddySeagoon	I'm used to the UK way when everyone posts annual accounts
Nov 15 11:23:29 quantumsummers	Banking - tsunam; anything new here?
Nov 15 11:23:36 tsunam	quantumsummers: nope nothing new 
Nov 15 11:23:40 quantumsummers	ok
Nov 15 11:23:41 quantumsummers	SFLC Engagement Letter Update - quantumsummers
Nov 15 11:24:07 NeddySeagoon	isn't it all wrapped up?  we have a bank and we recovered our funds ?
Nov 15 11:24:49 quantumsummers	meeting early next week with sflc, I'll email the details on Monday. I am also mailing a paper copy to them on Monday/
Nov 15 11:25:21 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: yes, I think banking is done now. dabbott we can remove it from the agenda for the next meeting 
Nov 15 11:25:32 dabbott	ok
Nov 15 11:25:44 quantumsummers	Meeting Minutes Need Updating - robbat2|na  -------skip until he arrives
Nov 15 11:25:49 quantumsummers	Gentoo 10 Live DVD For Sale Update - dabbott
Nov 15 11:26:22 NeddySeagoon	Can we ensure that trustees are copied on all SFLC correspondence.  I'm a little nervous of a single point of failure
Nov 15 11:26:38 dabbott	quantumsummers, do you have the latest agenda http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/minutes09/2009/200911_trustees_agenda.xml
Nov 15 11:26:57 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: that is the plan. anything that has any importance I plan to CC trustees@
Nov 15 11:27:11 quantumsummers	dabbott: no I had the one in /topic
Nov 15 11:27:37 *	quantumsummers gets back on track with the updated agenda
Nov 15 11:27:47 quantumsummers	Updating Registration in NM - tsunam
Nov 15 11:27:57 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, works for me as long as there are no other addresses on trustees@
Nov 15 11:28:24 quantumsummers	I could just as easily email each of us individually
Nov 15 11:28:24 tsunam	will be sending in the paperwork monday given the chance. Just so everyone is aware, its due in july of every year
Nov 15 11:28:44 quantumsummers	tsunam: ok, good to know.
Nov 15 11:28:50 *	quantumsummers puts it on the calendar
Nov 15 11:28:57 NeddySeagoon	tsunam, do we have to pay penalties ?
Nov 15 11:29:04 tsunam	20 bucks
Nov 15 11:29:05 tsunam	so yes
Nov 15 11:29:44 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, I think individual emails works better
Nov 15 11:29:52 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: will do
Nov 15 11:30:24 quantumsummers	ok, thanks for taking care of that tsunam
Nov 15 11:30:49 quantumsummers	ok, to me: sflc engagement is basically done
Nov 15 11:30:59 quantumsummers	Certified Public Accountant - quantumsummers
Nov 15 11:31:41 quantumsummers	I would like to setup a meeting with the CPA sometime in the next 30 days
Nov 15 11:32:03 quantumsummers	tsunam: is there an easy way to get our entire paypal history?
Nov 15 11:32:10 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, who do you need from our end. just you ?
Nov 15 11:32:24 tsunam	quantumsummers: well you had everything minus the last quater or two sent to you once
Nov 15 11:32:36 tsunam	as you forwarded that onto her 
Nov 15 11:32:42 quantumsummers	I can manage the meeting, but if anyone wants to join, that would be nice
Nov 15 11:32:59 quantumsummers	tsunam: that went back only about 2 years
Nov 15 11:33:21 tsunam	quantumsummers: nah I had sent you all the stuff from 2005 that the account covers
Nov 15 11:33:29 tsunam	but it'll take me time/effort to get them all again
Nov 15 11:33:38 tsunam	but it can be done again
Nov 15 11:34:02 quantumsummers	tsunam: I'll look back over what I have on Monday, don't worry about it for now
Nov 15 11:34:13 quantumsummers	you are likely correct
Nov 15 11:34:20 quantumsummers	I haven't looked it over in some time
Nov 15 11:34:45 quantumsummers	once we get the ball rolling on the 501c3, the CPA will need to be more invilved
Nov 15 11:34:50 quantumsummers	*involved
Nov 15 11:35:10 tsunam	*nods*
Nov 15 11:35:13 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, get a quote - we will need to pay for services
Nov 15 11:35:59 NeddySeagoon	the fees can't keep getting lost in yur bill
Nov 15 11:36:03 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: that is the plan, but the one I have been working with will charge us about $1000 for a year
Nov 15 11:36:18 quantumsummers	they can do the reports too
Nov 15 11:36:25 quantumsummers	formal ones, & our taxes
Nov 15 11:36:37 quantumsummers	which is really important after we have 501c3
Nov 15 11:36:42 NeddySeagoon	seems like a bargin for that price
Nov 15 11:36:43 tsunam	aye
Nov 15 11:36:45 dabbott	quantumsummers, when you talk to SFLC get a couple more cpa firms to get quotes from
Nov 15 11:36:47 quantumsummers	its a good deal
Nov 15 11:36:59 quantumsummers	dabbott: I will discuss that, sure
Nov 15 11:37:10 quantumsummers	see if they have someone they recommend.
Nov 15 11:37:29 quantumsummers	however, I do like the current cpa firm, they are quite nice & very accessibgle
Nov 15 11:37:40 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, we need to show we competed the work to show good value for money to auditors.  We do not have to go with the lowest cost quote
Nov 15 11:37:58 quantumsummers	anyway, I'll get that going next week as well
Nov 15 11:38:02 NeddySeagoon	ta
Nov 15 11:38:06 quantumsummers	we're in good shape
Nov 15 11:38:34 quantumsummers	hey, my wife just asked me to do something real quick. back in 30s ... sorry
Nov 15 11:39:27 quantumsummers	k
Nov 15 11:39:35 quantumsummers	little longer than 30s
Nov 15 11:39:48 quantumsummers	anything else on the CPA, questions comments
Nov 15 11:39:50 quantumsummers	?
Nov 15 11:39:59 NeddySeagoon	nothing from me
Nov 15 11:40:09 dabbott	nothing here
Nov 15 11:40:20 quantumsummers	ok
Nov 15 11:40:20 quantumsummers	Knowledge Management - quantumsummers
Nov 15 11:40:57 quantumsummers	big things coming in this area, we are days away from beta launch of our flagship system. 
Nov 15 11:41:11 dabbott	sweet
Nov 15 11:41:16 quantumsummers	as in it has to be in place by Wednesday 
Nov 15 11:41:24 quantumsummers	so, that should be fun
Nov 15 11:41:59 quantumsummers	I'll send the invites this week
Nov 15 11:42:44 quantumsummers	any pony requests?
Nov 15 11:42:53 NeddySeagoon	??
Nov 15 11:42:57 NeddySeagoon	pony ?
Nov 15 11:43:10 quantumsummers	lol, yeah, as in I wanna *
Nov 15 11:43:35 quantumsummers	are there any feature requests
Nov 15 11:43:59 NeddySeagoon	let us play with it ... then we can tell you :)
Nov 15 11:44:05 quantumsummers	we have instruments for just about everything, so ... ok
Nov 15 11:44:09 quantumsummers	:)
Nov 15 11:44:09 dabbott	yep
Nov 15 11:44:20 quantumsummers	ok robbat2|na is still away
Nov 15 11:44:34 quantumsummers	so on to
Nov 15 11:44:34 quantumsummers	4. Open Bugs
Nov 15 11:44:40 NeddySeagoon	On robbat2|na  stuff ...
Nov 15 11:44:48 quantumsummers	yes?
Nov 15 11:45:16 armin76	i want an armv7 board
Nov 15 11:45:40 *	armin76 suggests the gentoo foundation makes a deal with ARM.com
Nov 15 11:45:45 armin76	quick!
Nov 15 11:45:48 NeddySeagoon	Are we going to sell ad space?  wltjr suggested this about 18 months ago and was well flamed on -dev.  Donnie sent an email remining about the historical perspective 
Nov 15 11:45:50 quantumsummers	armin76: lol, please wait til open floor :P
Nov 15 11:46:04 dabbott	quantumsummers, there is your pony request :)
Nov 15 11:46:13 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: I can state that I have written the rotating side bar thing & am awaiting code review and deployment from infra
Nov 15 11:46:22 quantumsummers	already did the hard work there
Nov 15 11:46:27 tsunam	k
Nov 15 11:46:38 quantumsummers	its on g.o.g.o/proj.gentoo-ads.git
Nov 15 11:46:42 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, I am wondering how the rest of Gentoo feels.
Nov 15 11:46:49 quantumsummers	that is /proj/gentoo-ads.git
Nov 15 11:47:31 NeddySeagoon	I'm OK with major Gentoo users getting an ad but ads just for money, I'm not so sure
Nov 15 11:47:34 quantumsummers	I think that we need to make it a case by case basis for choosing who we allow into the sidebar
Nov 15 11:47:47 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, exactly
Nov 15 11:48:02 dabbott	some kind of accountability 
Nov 15 11:48:04 quantumsummers	we will find that, once we have 501c3, we will have more of this to deal with
Nov 15 11:48:29 quantumsummers	perhaps we should establish some criteria for acceptibility
Nov 15 11:48:48 NeddySeagoon	I'm just mindful of the flames early last year ... do we want to put it to a vote of members ?
Nov 15 11:49:16 dabbott	I say yes
Nov 15 11:49:18 quantumsummers	also note, that the thing I wrote will handle some fancy weighting, so we can control behavior pretty well, in the sense that we can tier things, etc
Nov 15 11:49:45 NeddySeagoon	dabbott, yes as in just do it, or yes put it to a vote ?
Nov 15 11:50:02 dabbott	I think we should put it to a vote
Nov 15 11:50:22 quantumsummers	if we look at other OSS foundations, they appear to accept funds from just about anyone, but the advert space is a real premium dedicated to important donors
Nov 15 11:50:31 NeddySeagoon	dabbott, thats not as easy as it sounds as only foundation members would be able to vote
Nov 15 11:50:54 NeddySeagoon	thats another can of worms
Nov 15 11:51:25 quantumsummers	how so, robbat2|na had the idea that we weight things based on a bogomip number
Nov 15 11:51:39 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, thats what Donnies email implied
Nov 15 11:51:52 quantumsummers	we can calc an equivalent for $$ donations
Nov 15 11:52:22 quantumsummers	in theory we could easily have 100s of ads in the thing & only the ones with the highest weight would be seen constently
Nov 15 11:52:44 NeddySeagoon	I'm not againt the idea but I don't want it to be the cause of a split between the Foundation and Gentoo
Nov 15 11:53:31 quantumsummers	hmm, yes I understand. we certainly do not want that. though it is gentoo that benefits from the foundation bringing in$
Nov 15 11:53:44 dabbott	We need to ask some way what the members and developers want done
Nov 15 11:53:53 quantumsummers	we could ask them
Nov 15 11:53:59 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, most of the argument will not be rational
Nov 15 11:54:27 quantumsummers	that is a bummer
Nov 15 11:54:35 quantumsummers	ok, so we just need some criteria
Nov 15 11:55:14 NeddySeagoon	we could set up a vote by the next meeting. Recording date of 1 Dec. (in case people want to join to vote) and a couple of weeks for the vote
Nov 15 11:55:47 quantumsummers	I'd be fine with that
Nov 15 11:55:47 quantumsummers	seems that if 
Nov 15 11:55:47 quantumsummers	1. the donor uses gentoo +1
Nov 15 11:55:47 quantumsummers	2. the donor employs gentoo uses or devs  +1
Nov 15 11:56:05 NeddySeagoon	Critera ... that major Gentoo users be permitted to purchase ads on the sidebar
Nov 15 11:56:05 dabbott	NeddySeagoon, that sounds good
Nov 15 11:56:52 NeddySeagoon	what "major" means is up to us
Nov 15 11:57:05 quantumsummers	that is where tiers come in
Nov 15 11:57:14 NeddySeagoon	wfm
Nov 15 11:58:03 quantumsummers	we can easily establish tiers based on this bogomip concept
Nov 15 11:58:11 quantumsummers	and its equiv $ value
Nov 15 11:58:22 NeddySeagoon	its not the detail quantumsummers its the yes/no to the ideal
Nov 15 11:58:56 quantumsummers	I see. it seems that there is already a yes to the ideal, as evidenced by the existing side bar
Nov 15 11:59:24 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, thats always been major sponsors providing hosting
Nov 15 11:59:37 NeddySeagoon	now we want top open it up to users
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Sun Nov 15 12:00:24 2009

Nov 15 12:00:24 quantumsummers	or to other types of support
Nov 15 12:00:25 NeddySeagoon	They will not be placing ads for hosting
Nov 15 12:01:11 quantumsummers	motion: lets put it to a vote of the membership.
Nov 15 12:01:23 quantumsummers	any seconds?
Nov 15 12:01:31 dabbott	second
Nov 15 12:01:31 NeddySeagoon	seconded
Nov 15 12:01:50 NeddySeagoon	Vote
Nov 15 12:01:54 NeddySeagoon	+1
Nov 15 12:01:59 dabbott	yes
Nov 15 12:02:01 tsunam	yes
Nov 15 12:02:18 NeddySeagoon	cariied
Nov 15 12:02:31 NeddySeagoon	Wording for the ballot ...
Nov 15 12:03:08 NeddySeagoon	Should major Gentoo users be permitted to purchase ads on the sidebar  - Vote yes or No
Nov 15 12:04:44 *	quantumsummers is happy with that
Nov 15 12:04:47 dabbott	May be explain major
Nov 15 12:05:20 quantumsummers	how much $$ does it take to get on there?
Nov 15 12:06:45 NeddySeagoon	something similar to the value of the hosting existing advertises provide.
Nov 15 12:06:48 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: we need to involve the elections proj on this right?
Nov 15 12:06:56 NeddySeagoon	robbat2|na, was working out what that was likely to be
Nov 15 12:07:01 quantumsummers	ok
Nov 15 12:07:15 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, yep - they are not responing to my ping right now
Nov 15 12:08:32 quantumsummers	alrighty. are we ready to move on then?
Nov 15 12:08:45 NeddySeagoon	We may need an extrodinary one topic meeting at the end of November to approve new members
Nov 15 12:08:57 NeddySeagoon	Summary ...
Nov 15 12:09:20 NeddySeagoon	Put to the vote of the membership that major Gentoo users be permitted to purchase ads on the sidebar
Nov 15 12:10:11 NeddySeagoon	Timescale.  Recording date. 1st Dec.  Polls close 11 Dec, so we can get a count before our next meeting
Nov 15 12:10:43 NeddySeagoon	Is that ok ?
Nov 15 12:10:55 quantumsummers	yes, perfect
Nov 15 12:11:08 dabbott	yes
Nov 15 12:11:40 NeddySeagoon	I'll post on -project and -dev-annouce, in case anyone wants to join to vote 
Nov 15 12:11:53 quantumsummers	very good sir
Nov 15 12:12:01 quantumsummers	thank you
Nov 15 12:12:08 dabbott	Should Gentoo users be permitted to purchase ads on the sidebar if they contribute similar to the value that the existing advertises provide, the donor uses Gentoo.  - Vote yes or No
Nov 15 12:12:51 NeddySeagoon	dabbott, I was going to make it simpler, so that the definitions were left to us on a case by case basis
Nov 15 12:13:33 quantumsummers	exactly
Nov 15 12:13:41 dabbott	Ok :)
Nov 15 12:13:55 NeddySeagoon	We don't need the ballot words right now
Nov 15 12:14:10 quantumsummers	it is rather likely that we will have to add to this policy over time anyway, best to keep it simple for now
Nov 15 12:14:17 NeddySeagoon	yep
Nov 15 12:14:29 NeddySeagoon	OK, that was all I had on that topic
Nov 15 12:14:36 quantumsummers	ready to move to open bugs?
Nov 15 12:14:41 NeddySeagoon	yes
Nov 15 12:14:48 dabbott	yes
Nov 15 12:15:05 quantumsummers	bug 239302
Nov 15 12:15:07 Willikins	quantumsummers: https://bugs.gentoo.org/239302 "wrong description of Gentoo Vendors site and strange reference to Gentoo Store"; Doc Other, Other; NEW; micm@g.o:trustees@g.o
Nov 15 12:15:39 dabbott	really need robbat2|na for this, I did put together http://dev.gentoo.org/~dabbott/pr/where.xml
Nov 15 12:15:46 NeddySeagoon	didn't robbat2|na commit that page ?
Nov 15 12:16:11 quantumsummers	looks that way'
Nov 15 12:16:16 quantumsummers	http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/stores.xml
Nov 15 12:16:43 NeddySeagoon	lets close the bug then
Nov 15 12:16:55 NeddySeagoon	dabbott, that works for me
Nov 15 12:17:03 quantumsummers	http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml was updated 12 OCT
Nov 15 12:17:30 quantumsummers	http://vendors.gentoo.org/
Nov 15 12:17:33 quantumsummers	this is all messed up
Nov 15 12:17:41 dabbott	but it is not done
Nov 15 12:17:46 quantumsummers	ok
Nov 15 12:18:10 dabbott	here is an example vendors page http://dev.gentoo.org/~dabbott/pr/vendors.xml
Nov 15 12:18:13 NeddySeagoon	dabbott, do you have commit access to fix it ?
Nov 15 12:18:27 quantumsummers	looks like its shaping up
Nov 15 12:18:30 quantumsummers	dabbott: mind closing the above bug?
Nov 15 12:18:37 NeddySeagoon	dabbott, that look ok

Nov 15 12:20:56 quantumsummers	shall I send them a C&D?
Nov 15 12:21:10 quantumsummers	friendly version :D
Nov 15 12:21:56 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, what are they selling?  are they doing it for profit
Nov 15 12:22:46 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: $5 a dvd
Nov 15 12:23:01 dabbott	I am not so sure we need to put a lot of time into C&D
Nov 15 12:23:05 NeddySeagoon	is that at profit in the USA ?
Nov 15 12:23:21 quantumsummers	I'd say it is, but a real slim margin on that
Nov 15 12:23:44 quantumsummers	hey, they even have my name on the description
Nov 15 12:23:53 NeddySeagoon	Get them to acknowledge our marks is all.  
Nov 15 12:24:31 quantumsummers	http://www.linuxcd.org/view_distro.php?id_distro=12
Nov 15 12:24:36 quantumsummers	interesting setup
Nov 15 12:25:14 quantumsummers	I'll contact them
Nov 15 12:25:18 NeddySeagoon	get then to take down 2007 and 2008
Nov 15 12:25:56 NeddySeagoon	and all the old stuff ... hmm they have more history than we do P)
Nov 15 12:26:14 quantumsummers	yeah, lol
Nov 15 12:26:24 quantumsummers	I just updated that bug
Nov 15 12:26:34 quantumsummers	bug 288626

Nov 15 12:27:02 NeddySeagoon	yeah, looks like a plan
Nov 15 12:27:15 quantumsummers	sounds like there is progress here
Nov 15 12:27:52 quantumsummers	set a check on that item for next meeting
Nov 15 12:28:30 dabbott	I was thinking later, the Live DVD is getting really good 10.2-r4 is nice
Nov 15 12:29:01 dabbott	likewhoa is making it better and better all the time
Nov 15 12:29:10 NeddySeagoon	does cafepress still not do DVDs ?
Nov 15 12:29:56 dabbott	we talked about it last meeting, it was not worth it, no profit 
Nov 15 12:30:06 quantumsummers	yes, I recall that
Nov 15 12:30:07 NeddySeagoon	ok
Nov 15 12:30:10 quantumsummers	we'll check in on progress & the next meeting
Nov 15 12:30:18 quantumsummers	s/&/@
Nov 15 12:30:24 dabbott	we can set up something with another vendor we chose
Nov 15 12:30:31 quantumsummers	cool.
Nov 15 12:30:37 quantumsummers	5. New Business
Nov 15 12:30:45 quantumsummers	Oliver Giesectk (Channel Plus Ltd.)  	
Nov 15 12:30:53 NeddySeagoon	we have an application from a DVD vendor ... maybe combine the two.  They were going to get back to us
Nov 15 12:31:22 NeddySeagoon	We need the results of the vote we just agreed to
Nov 15 12:31:25 quantumsummers	yes
Nov 15 12:31:45 quantumsummers	postpone decision on Oliver Giesectk (Channel Plus Ltd.)  	 pending vote
Nov 15 12:31:52 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, can you keep him updated of the situation please
Nov 15 12:32:01 quantumsummers	sure, I'll email him
Nov 15 12:32:06 NeddySeagoon	thanks
Nov 15 12:32:07 quantumsummers	Stormfront (DVD Vender) 
Nov 15 12:32:09 quantumsummers	np
Nov 15 12:32:09 dabbott	Stormfront this is the vendor we can may be get together with, he is a Gentoo user, active on the forums etc.
Nov 15 12:32:29 quantumsummers	looks good, its nice that he is involved
Nov 15 12:32:59 NeddySeagoon	looks good.  Has he mad an offer of a % per DVD ?
Nov 15 12:33:16 dabbott	yes he did
Nov 15 12:33:42 NeddySeagoon	I missed the email then.  I'll go with everyone else on a vote
Nov 15 12:34:44 quantumsummers	dabbott: will you handle the conversation with stormfront?
Nov 15 12:35:00 quantumsummers	seems like you know the guy
Nov 15 12:35:20 dabbott	yes sure
Nov 15 12:35:53 quantumsummers	do we need to vote on this item?
Nov 15 12:36:09 dabbott	The links to all the vendors selling DVD's CD's, I will go through them and see which ones are still good
Nov 15 12:36:30 dabbott	I will report back next meeting
Nov 15 12:36:30 quantumsummers	I think I recall a donation of 15% from stormfront, is that correct dabbott?
Nov 15 12:37:20 dabbott	I will have to look
Nov 15 12:37:38 quantumsummers	ok, just CC trustees when you email him.
Nov 15 12:37:44 dabbott	OK
Nov 15 12:37:51 quantumsummers	Brazilian Store of Linux Media 
Nov 15 12:37:57 NeddySeagoon	I found the thread but it ends with stormfront saying they will get back to us
Nov 15 12:38:06 dabbott	I can add them to the vendor list
Nov 15 12:38:25 quantumsummers	dabbott: ok, for the brazil folks
Nov 15 12:38:46 NeddySeagoon	ok for me too, as long at they acknowledge our marks
Nov 15 12:39:04 dabbott	I want to move the vendors away from where.xml to their own page
Nov 15 12:39:05 tsunam	fine here too
Nov 15 12:39:20 quantumsummers	alright. good
Nov 15 12:39:24 NeddySeagoon	Pilla says it looks good - hes a brazillian forums admin
Nov 15 12:39:49 dabbott	sold
Nov 15 12:39:57 quantumsummers	Lutz Borkenhagen : postpone until next meeting pending vote
Nov 15 12:40:06 quantumsummers	Users Thank You Donations - NeddySeagoon 	
Nov 15 12:40:24 quantumsummers	(I'll email Lutz too)
Nov 15 12:40:36 NeddySeagoon	yep
Nov 15 12:42:31 quantumsummers	so, Users Thank You Donations - NeddySeagoon
Nov 15 12:42:47 quantumsummers	what do you have in mind here Neddy?
Nov 15 12:43:18 NeddySeagoon	I was wondering if we should email users who donate more that a certain amount a 'thank you' note
Nov 15 12:45:05 dabbott	We may not have the time to keep it up
Nov 15 12:45:19 NeddySeagoon	ok, drop it then
Nov 15 12:45:38 dabbott	You can add aspecial think you to pay pal, to personalize it 
Nov 15 12:45:55 quantumsummers	it might be possible to automate this sort of thing a little
Nov 15 12:46:19 NeddySeagoon	I just wanted to kick the idea around a little - that was akk
Nov 15 12:46:23 NeddySeagoon	all*
Nov 15 12:46:45 quantumsummers	ok, I like it, perhaps it just needs a little thought with respect to the logistics, etc
Nov 15 12:47:09 quantumsummers	6. Membership Applications  -- None this month
Nov 15 12:47:12 NeddySeagoon	and the minimum value maybe ?
Nov 15 12:47:40 quantumsummers	perhaps, or just have a few emails, a separate one for each level of donation
Nov 15 12:48:02 quantumsummers	we have seen some ~$10 which is a nice though
Nov 15 12:48:06 quantumsummers	thought*
Nov 15 12:48:12 NeddySeagoon	yep
Nov 15 12:48:26 quantumsummers	now if we got a $1000 donation, we should send them a personal email
Nov 15 12:48:35 NeddySeagoon	yeah
Nov 15 12:49:03 dabbott	a yearly thank you web page 
Nov 15 12:49:06 quantumsummers	most are in the $20 to $50 & if paypal can send them a nice note on our behalf, then that is the way to go
Nov 15 12:49:19 NeddySeagoon	yep
Nov 15 12:49:28 quantumsummers	dabbott: the trouble with a public thing like that is some wish to remain anonymous
Nov 15 12:49:37 dabbott	ahh ok
Nov 15 12:49:40 quantumsummers	we have no way of telling who thoughn
Nov 15 12:50:13 NeddySeagoon	lets preserve anonymous just in case
Nov 15 12:50:26 quantumsummers	yes
Nov 15 12:50:50 dabbott	tsunam, quantumsummers, you can customize the thank you if you have access to the pay pal account
Nov 15 12:50:57 tsunam	that we can
Nov 15 12:51:14 *	NeddySeagoon does not use paypal
Nov 15 12:51:15 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: would you like to draft a note?
Nov 15 12:51:37 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, ok - I'll do that off line
Nov 15 12:52:12 quantumsummers	tsunam, NeddySeagoon, can you two coordinate implementing that?
Nov 15 12:52:32 quantumsummers	I think I can log into paypal, its been awhile ...

Nov 15 13:03:12 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: let me know in the next couple of days how that is going. It might be too short of notice, & we may have to use an alternative vote
Nov 15 13:03:39 quantumsummers	any other business?
Nov 15 13:04:03 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, we could do signed emails to trustees but its a bit of a mess

Nov 15 13:06:28 quantumsummers	your arm thing
Nov 15 13:06:32 quantumsummers	:D
Nov 15 13:07:02 armin76	well
Nov 15 13:07:07 armin76	i want an armv7 board
Nov 15 13:07:22 armin76	can't we get a deal with ARM.com like canonical has?
Nov 15 13:07:39 NeddySeagoon	armin76, what deal do they have ?
Nov 15 13:08:14 armin76	NeddySeagoon: well, what i know is that they get hardware, i guess in exchange of porting ubuntu to it
Nov 15 13:08:29 NeddySeagoon	armin76, is it just you, or the whole ARM project wants one each ?
Nov 15 13:08:46 quantumsummers	armin76: we can approach them. didn't we have something with marvel too?
Nov 15 13:09:13 armin76	NeddySeagoon: well, the whole arm team would like boards, obviously
Nov 15 13:09:21 *	quantumsummers will brb
Nov 15 13:09:23 NeddySeagoon	armin76, file a bug saying which one you want and why its a good choice for what you want to do
Nov 15 13:09:32 armin76	quantumsummers: the contact at marvell can't do anything
Nov 15 13:09:39 NeddySeagoon	armin76, how may boards is that ?
Nov 15 13:09:51 armin76	quantumsummers: i was told by a marvell worker: ubuntu has them because Marvell has a deal with canonical
Nov 15 13:10:03 armin76	NeddySeagoon: dunno, 4?
Nov 15 13:10:39 NeddySeagoon	armin76, I was thinking of going for a number like 4 with the hope of getting 2
Nov 15 13:11:07 armin76	well, don't worry
Nov 15 13:11:23 NeddySeagoon	armin76, file your bug
Nov 15 13:11:31 armin76	i wrote to ARM today, i'll let you know what comes out on the4 next trustees meeting
Nov 15 13:11:49 NeddySeagoon	armin76, ok, or post to trustees@
Nov 15 13:12:15 NeddySeagoon	armin76, which bit of ARM did you write to ?
Nov 15 13:13:18 armin76	NeddySeagoon: connected community
Nov 15 13:13:33 NeddySeagoon	OK
Nov 15 13:13:34 quantumsummers	armin76: please cc the alias
Nov 15 13:13:38 NeddySeagoon	good luck

Nov 15 13:13:49 quantumsummers	how much are the boards?
Nov 15 13:14:32 armin76	NeddySeagoon: its a tracker thing, so i got a number, hope that means they'll answer me :)
Nov 15 13:14:50 NeddySeagoon	:)
Nov 15 13:14:58 armin76	quantumsummers: well, i was hoping free...if not, then we can forget about them, they can cost 3000$ or more
Nov 15 13:16:41 quantumsummers	wow
Nov 15 13:17:16 armin76	quantumsummers: they're prototype boards
Nov 15 13:17:57 quantumsummers	that's more $$ than a vertex 5 fpga, lol
Nov 15 13:18:06 armin76	i even told the marvell guy to give us the boards that ubuntu don't support anymore, but he said no
Nov 15 13:19:02 quantumsummers	alright, we'll see about it. I have no trouble assisting in the discussion if you need armin76
Nov 15 13:19:02 armin76	http://www.ubuntu.com/news/arm-linux <- /me wants something like that
Nov 15 13:19:02 NeddySeagoon	It probably wasn't his decision to make
Nov 15 13:20:07 quantumsummers	armin76: please keep us in the loop, if you need help let us know
Nov 15 13:20:15 armin76	sure, thanks
