Sep 13 12:03:51 quantumsummers|c	robbat2|na: ping :)
Sep 13 12:04:35 quantumsummers|c	tsunam, dabbott, we have quorum I believe
Sep 13 12:04:46 tsunam	barely but do
Sep 13 12:04:50 dabbott	yes
Sep 13 12:05:13 quantumsummers|c	I think we need to choose a Vice Chair.
Sep 13 12:05:35 dabbott	who wants it
Sep 13 12:05:52 quantumsummers|c	hmm
Sep 13 12:06:31 tsunam	I'm already holding one position so I shouldn't
Sep 13 12:07:11 dabbott	I nominate quantumsummers|c 
Sep 13 12:07:23 *	quantumsummers|c is now known as quantumsummers
Sep 13 12:07:41 quantumsummers	I accept
Sep 13 12:07:57 tsunam	all those in favor
Sep 13 12:08:06 dabbott	I
Sep 13 12:08:09 tsunam	aye
Sep 13 12:08:25 quantumsummers	yes
Sep 13 12:08:44 tsunam	well as that's everyone here..there's no opposals 
Sep 13 12:09:03 tsunam	motion caries
Sep 13 12:09:08 robbat2|na	pong
Sep 13 12:09:10 quantumsummers	thanks
Sep 13 12:09:10 robbat2|na	i'm here
Sep 13 12:09:24 robbat2|na	aye from me too
Sep 13 12:09:41 dabbott	quantumsummers is the Vice Chairman
Sep 13 12:09:57 quantumsummers	I have just a couple of things w.r.t. an agenda: 
Sep 13 12:09:57 quantumsummers	1) Welcome dabbott to the board
Sep 13 12:09:57 quantumsummers	2) Gentoo 10 release date & party
Sep 13 12:10:18 *	quantumsummers claps for dabbott, welcome :)
Sep 13 12:10:24 *	robbat2|na joins
Sep 13 12:10:32 quantumsummers	huzzah
Sep 13 12:10:51 quantumsummers	anything you would like to say dabbott?
Sep 13 12:11:10 dabbott	Ask not what your distro can do for you; ask what you can do for your distro.
Sep 13 12:11:26 quantumsummers	well put.
Sep 13 12:11:36 dabbott	thank you everyone
Sep 13 12:11:37 tsunam	lol
Sep 13 12:12:11 quantumsummers	the date of 2009 10 04 has been proposed as the release date for g10 livedvd. It appears to be on track.
Sep 13 12:12:32 quantumsummers	there was some interest in pressing media for distribution
Sep 13 12:13:05 quantumsummers	I was able to find prices on said media ranging from 400-600 USD
Sep 13 12:13:16 quantumsummers	for 1000 disks
Sep 13 12:13:23 quantumsummers	seems a tad pricey
Sep 13 12:13:41 quantumsummers	I am curious if anyone has experience with this sort of thing
Sep 13 12:13:50 tsunam	I would be against pressing media. It's been proven from the store in previous years its not a primary thing people are interested in
Sep 13 12:14:05 quantumsummers	fair enough
Sep 13 12:14:06 robbat2|na	quantumsummers, as pressed media prices go, at that quantity, it's a good price
Sep 13 12:14:11 robbat2|na	but i concur with tsunam
Sep 13 12:14:27 dabbott	I agree with tsunam 
Sep 13 12:14:28 robbat2|na	unless we're going to use it to hand out at cons etc
Sep 13 12:14:30 quantumsummers	robbat2|na: thanks. good to know it wasn't orbbery
Sep 13 12:14:42 robbat2|na	selling them hasn't worked out well in the past
Sep 13 12:15:33 dabbott	yes it would be nice to provide them to dev's that go to conferences and such
Sep 13 12:16:12 quantumsummers	we could just provide  empty disks & an official label
Sep 13 12:16:29 quantumsummers	to some devs ahead of the conf for self burning perhaps
Sep 13 12:16:36 robbat2|na	pre-printed CD-Rs?
Sep 13 12:16:42 robbat2|na	& DVD-Rs
Sep 13 12:16:45 *	tove (n=tove@smtp.gentoo.org) has joined #gentoo-trustees
Sep 13 12:16:45 *	ChanServ gives voice to tove
Sep 13 12:17:18 quantumsummers	could be, I think the sticker labels would be cheap to have printed & we could send blank dvds
Sep 13 12:17:34 quantumsummers	no idea if that would work at all in practice
Sep 13 12:17:40 quantumsummers	could be a pain
Sep 13 12:18:01 robbat2|na	nicely done sticker labels could work out, cheaper shipping by weight than the media
Sep 13 12:18:17 quantumsummers	yes
Sep 13 12:18:20 robbat2|na	but disk weight issues if the label is off-centre
Sep 13 12:18:47 quantumsummers	yes, almost need the little application device to have good results
Sep 13 12:19:12 quantumsummers	what about lightscripe, the media is a tad $$$ iirc
Sep 13 12:19:23 tsunam	and takes a while
Sep 13 12:19:58 robbat2|na	and drives aren't that common
Sep 13 12:20:45 tsunam	anyways a bit off topic from the meeting no?
Sep 13 12:20:52 robbat2|na	hmm, pre-printed media is nearly the same price as print+press
Sep 13 12:21:07 robbat2|na	yeah, the question for the meeting remains, is there sufficent demand that they'll be used up
Sep 13 12:21:12 robbat2|na	before the next actual release
Sep 13 12:21:20 robbat2|na	esp with the functional weeklys
Sep 13 12:21:47 quantumsummers	if we could get a smaller number at a reasonable price we could avoid carrying the inventory
Sep 13 12:22:08 robbat2|na	the cost goes way up
Sep 13 12:22:10 robbat2|na	per unit
Sep 13 12:22:44 quantumsummers	hmm, this may warrant some further discussion
Sep 13 12:23:23 dabbott	see how much demand there really is
Sep 13 12:23:36 tsunam	i would suspect minimal to be honest
Sep 13 12:24:12 quantumsummers	I move that we table this discussion until we have a better idea about by when & how many are needed. We can manage via email.
Sep 13 12:24:21 robbat2|na	seconded
Sep 13 12:24:46 quantumsummers	tsunam, dabbott: you ok with the above?
Sep 13 12:24:50 tsunam	yep
Sep 13 12:24:54 dabbott	yes
Sep 13 12:25:00 quantumsummers	kk. thanks
Sep 13 12:25:53 quantumsummers	so there is the date of the birthday, oct 4. We should have some PR stuff go out, and I believe that the linux-mag article will be publishable around then
Sep 13 12:26:33 quantumsummers	any ideas about what, if anything, the foundation should do to celebrate?
Sep 13 12:27:03 quantumsummers	we have the screenshot contest coming out around then.
Sep 13 12:27:14 dabbott	yep
Sep 13 12:28:26 robbat2|na	unofficial release parties?
Sep 13 12:28:52 quantumsummers	robbat2|na: sounds good. how to advertise?
Sep 13 12:29:19 quantumsummers	someone should get a cake made ;)
Sep 13 12:29:39 robbat2|na	that would probably be locally at the parties if any
Sep 13 12:29:47 dabbott	Roy could spike the coffee machine
Sep 13 12:29:47 quantumsummers	sure
Sep 13 12:30:49 robbat2|na	probably just on mailing lists and personal blogs, since they are unofficial
Sep 13 12:30:58 robbat2|na	and that's getting offtopic for the meeting again I think
Sep 13 12:31:03 dabbott	and a news item
Sep 13 12:31:09 quantumsummers	we should encourage users & devs to get together & celebrate, then do a photo stream on flickr or something
Sep 13 12:31:25 robbat2|na	yup, a news item on the frontpage
Sep 13 12:31:26 quantumsummers	ok, there are several things we should talk about beyond this.
Sep 13 12:31:33 robbat2|na	but lets deal with other business
Sep 13 12:31:46 quantumsummers	tsunam: what is the status of the annual report?
Sep 13 12:31:51 quantumsummers	financials, etc
Sep 13 12:31:54 tsunam	finished and ready to provide
Sep 13 12:32:00 quantumsummers	sweet!!!
Sep 13 12:32:05 tsunam	Gross Income for the period of July 1,2008 through June 30,2009 was $6,068.06. Of which 67% came during the first half of the year.
Sep 13 12:32:08 tsunam	Expenditures for the same period were $793.29. Majority of which went to Legal fees related to filings with the state of new mexico. The cost of the filings counted for 64% of the expenditures for the fiscal year. The rest is accounted for in fee's leveraged by paypal.
Sep 13 12:32:12 tsunam	Net income for the period was $5,274.77
Sep 13 12:32:33 quantumsummers	good
Sep 13 12:32:51 quantumsummers	tsunam: what about the filing with the state of NM?
Sep 13 12:32:56 robbat2|na	err, /me could have sworn that there were some infra costs during that timeperiod
Sep 13 12:32:58 quantumsummers	how is that going
Sep 13 12:33:13 robbat2|na	or were all of those dated past the close of the FY?
Sep 13 12:33:20 tsunam	robbat2|na: past the close
Sep 13 12:33:29 tsunam	they'll appear in this years
Sep 13 12:33:34 robbat2|na	ok, thanks
Sep 13 12:33:41 tsunam	quantumsummers: I'll be sending it out next week
Sep 13 12:34:01 quantumsummers	alright, thanks a ton tsunam. we're ahead of the game. excellent
Sep 13 12:34:25 quantumsummers	I will need the financials to give to the CPA soon.
Sep 13 12:34:56 quantumsummers	this is the final piece in constructing the 1023 form for 501c3
Sep 13 12:35:19 tsunam	quantumsummers: I sent you the statements from paypal
Sep 13 12:35:25 tsunam	you need something else?
Sep 13 12:35:33 quantumsummers	tsunam: let me look
Sep 13 12:35:43 tsunam	that was a while ago
Sep 13 12:36:04 quantumsummers	yes, it was. there are no updates since then?
Sep 13 12:36:30 tsunam	well the first quarters ends at the end of this month
Sep 13 12:36:41 tsunam	so there will be a new one for q1 10
Sep 13 12:37:29 quantumsummers	ok, I'll put things together on my end & see if there is anything else we need
Sep 13 12:38:01 tsunam	k
Sep 13 12:38:07 quantumsummers	this dovetails with the SFLC call we have rescheduled
Sep 13 12:38:50 quantumsummers	I think this could be really good for us, to get at least some involvement from them
Sep 13 12:39:12 quantumsummers	dabbott: when is the call?
Sep 13 12:39:32 dabbott	tues 12:30pm EST
Sep 13 12:39:55 quantumsummers	can we all be there?
Sep 13 12:40:02 quantumsummers	I can
Sep 13 12:40:05 armin76	monkeys?
Sep 13 12:40:10 quantumsummers	lolZ
Sep 13 12:40:12 robbat2|na	i'll try to be on it too
Sep 13 12:40:13 dabbott	He tested on his end and it worked fine so hopefully no problems
Sep 13 12:40:19 tsunam	I can't
Sep 13 12:40:32 quantumsummers	ok
Sep 13 12:40:47 quantumsummers	armin76: how big of a monkey?
Sep 13 12:41:06 quantumsummers	that is good, the board will be well represented
Sep 13 12:41:42 dabbott	robbat2|na, I will send you the number
Sep 13 12:41:51 robbat2|na	dabbott, you said EST? did you mean EDT? just making sure I have the correct time offset
Sep 13 12:42:08 quantumsummers	EDT
Sep 13 12:42:20 dabbott	New_York
Sep 13 12:42:27 quantumsummers	"new york time"
Sep 13 12:42:36 robbat2|na	that's EDT at the moment yes
Sep 13 12:42:45 robbat2|na	just checking since dabbott said EST above
Sep 13 12:42:51 robbat2|na	just use UTC, easier
Sep 13 12:43:06 robbat2|na	13h30 UTC
Sep 13 12:43:18 robbat2|na	MinnieBannister ^^^^ so you might be there too?
Sep 13 12:43:27 robbat2|na	depending on his work travels
Sep 13 12:43:54 quantumsummers	as we are not following a formal agenda today, I propose we move to bugs.
Sep 13 12:44:15 quantumsummers	ok with everyone, or shall we discuss the call?
Sep 13 12:44:48 quantumsummers	re: SFLC, I plan to put together several points that would benefit from discussion. 
Sep 13 12:45:05 quantumsummers	anyone caring to contribute to that is welcome to do so
Sep 13 12:45:23 quantumsummers	Bug 284517
Sep 13 12:45:26 Willikins	quantumsummers: https://bugs.gentoo.org/284517 "Hardware Funding Request: Efika MX Open Client"; Gentoo Linux, Unspecified; NEW; darkside@g.o:trustees@g.o
Sep 13 12:45:49 robbat2|na	aye from me on it
Sep 13 12:45:55 quantumsummers	looks like an interesting investment
Sep 13 12:45:55 dabbott	yes
Sep 13 12:46:01 robbat2|na	to clarify one item with it
Sep 13 12:46:06 quantumsummers	yes?
Sep 13 12:46:28 robbat2|na	Genesi may be providing two other developers with the boards (it's pending), but this one we'd actually be purchasing and probably have sooner
Sep 13 12:46:41 quantumsummers	understood
Sep 13 12:48:21 quantumsummers	I would like to see a blog post per week come out of the proj as a condition of funding
Sep 13 12:48:40 tsunam	darkside_: ^^^
Sep 13 12:48:43 robbat2|na	for what timeframe?
Sep 13 12:49:00 robbat2|na	received till +6 months?
Sep 13 12:49:32 quantumsummers	when will the device arrive?
Sep 13 12:49:43 quantumsummers	6 months sounds fine
Sep 13 12:49:56 quantumsummers	25 post
Sep 13 12:50:01 quantumsummers	that is a good nuber
Sep 13 12:50:17 quantumsummers	is that too much work darkside_?
Sep 13 12:51:00 robbat2|na	the PPC genesi hardware shipped from Germany, and took a couple of weeks to arrive before
Sep 13 12:51:13 quantumsummers	so relatively quick
Sep 13 12:51:43 quantumsummers	tsunam: how do you vote?
Sep 13 12:51:59 tsunam	the purchase is fine with me
Sep 13 12:52:07 tsunam	but need feedback from darkside before ordering
Sep 13 12:52:35 quantumsummers	ok. I'll post it to the bug. What sort of feedback?
Sep 13 12:52:45 tsunam	if he accepts the condition
Sep 13 12:52:49 quantumsummers	:)
Sep 13 12:53:28 quantumsummers	he did mention a blog in the request, perhaps its just a suggested number of posts, so its not too much pressure
Sep 13 12:54:48 quantumsummers	ok
Sep 13 12:54:56 quantumsummers	Bug 284224
Sep 13 12:54:57 Willikins	quantumsummers: https://bugs.gentoo.org/284224 "Summer of Code changes in reimbursement"; Gentoo Linux, Unspecified; NEW; dberkholz@g.o:trustees@g.o
Sep 13 12:55:13 quantumsummers	seems that we discussed this on the bug fairly well.
Sep 13 12:55:38 tsunam	as long as the cost stays within the amount donnie specified I'm okie with it
Sep 13 12:56:01 quantumsummers	me too
Sep 13 12:56:36 dabbott	fine with me
Sep 13 12:56:41 robbat2|na	aye from me
Sep 13 12:56:46 quantumsummers	ok, good
Sep 13 12:56:56 quantumsummers	we will proceed with Donnie
Sep 13 12:58:35 quantumsummers	that's all the bugs I had. Any others?
Sep 13 12:59:11 robbat2|na	nothing of current business I know
Sep 13 12:59:34 quantumsummers	we have had no new membership applications.
Sep 13 12:59:57 quantumsummers	any other business?
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Sun Sep 13 13:00:10 2009

Sep 13 13:00:10 dabbott	new business? 
Sep 13 13:00:18 quantumsummers	yes
Sep 13 13:00:51 dabbott	The LiveDVD needs some help generating artwork
Sep 13 13:01:19 dabbott	there was a suggestion of a bounty but may be out of time
Sep 13 13:01:53 quantumsummers	by bounty, you mean pay someone?
Sep 13 13:02:03 dabbott	yes
Sep 13 13:02:04 quantumsummers	a "winner"
Sep 13 13:02:32 quantumsummers	is it competitive?
Sep 13 13:02:37 *	likewhoa (n=y0@ool-45717734.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #gentoo-trustees
Sep 13 13:02:59 robbat2|na	dabbott, can you specific what artwork you were looking for?
Sep 13 13:03:09 robbat2|na	just a FB splashscreen and desktop background
Sep 13 13:03:15 robbat2|na	or more like full theming etc?
Sep 13 13:03:28 quantumsummers	~3 weeks left. hmm not much time. I have a vector artist friend working on a couple of concepts (free)
Sep 13 13:03:57 likewhoa	quantumsummers: can he make some icons as well?
Sep 13 13:04:01 dabbott	Full theme would be nice but anything is better than what we have now
Sep 13 13:04:08 quantumsummers	likewhoa: not enough for a full theme
Sep 13 13:04:20 likewhoa	dabbott: I got 3 wallpapers in the works :)
Sep 13 13:04:23 quantumsummers	I called in a favor to get the wallpapers
Sep 13 13:04:28 robbat2|na	historically we've just done a framebuffer splash, and a wallpaper
Sep 13 13:05:02 quantumsummers	works for me
Sep 13 13:05:19 quantumsummers	we could have an art contest, but we're running out of tome
Sep 13 13:05:21 quantumsummers	*time
Sep 13 13:06:03 robbat2|na	we get the wallpapers from likewhoa and quantumsummers's art friend, and use the most evenly toned one for a splash screen
Sep 13 13:06:23 quantumsummers	+1
Sep 13 13:06:29 likewhoa	robbat2|na: i was going to use the old 2008.0 splash theme and work from that
Sep 13 13:06:42 likewhoa	it has nice icons for boot sequence
Sep 13 13:06:53 robbat2|na	likewhoa, just with a new background
Sep 13 13:07:16 likewhoa	talk about boot sequence, how about we equipped the linux penguin with a G logo on it's stomach?
Sep 13 13:07:36 quantumsummers	would take a kernel patch
Sep 13 13:07:39 quantumsummers	I think
Sep 13 13:07:49 quantumsummers	sounds cool though
Sep 13 13:08:14 robbat2|na	likewhoa, do you mean for the early boot, or the fb background?
Sep 13 13:08:19 likewhoa	early boot
Sep 13 13:08:25 likewhoa	top left logo
Sep 13 13:08:51 robbat2|na	kernel patch, but should be pretty trivial to patch in, just need the artwork
Sep 13 13:08:57 robbat2|na	there's a script in the kernel to put your own image in
Sep 13 13:09:08 quantumsummers	heh, nice
Sep 13 13:09:22 jmbsvicetto	There was some talk about adding some music as well
Sep 13 13:09:36 jmbsvicetto	Nothing concrete, just some talk about it
Sep 13 13:09:43 quantumsummers	music would be nice :)
Sep 13 13:09:56 quantumsummers	something ethereal ;)
Sep 13 13:12:18 likewhoa	i have someone right now that will make a beat but he needs to know what type of style music to make.
Sep 13 13:12:42 quantumsummers	tribal
Sep 13 13:12:45 quantumsummers	:D
Sep 13 13:12:59 likewhoa	he's a techno,dnb,breakbeats,trance,house etc.. electronic sounds producer
Sep 13 13:13:18 quantumsummers	this appears to need further future discussion, we can manage via email, no?
Sep 13 13:13:58 robbat2|na	likewhoa, chill-room stuff, low on the bass
Sep 13 13:14:35 likewhoa	ok sounds good
Sep 13 13:14:49 quantumsummers	likewhoa: perhaps some samples when they are ready?
Sep 13 13:15:19 likewhoa	yes, i'll have him make several samples
Sep 13 13:15:30 quantumsummers	ok, thanks likewhoa.
Sep 13 13:15:31 likewhoa	next question would be, how long should the samples be?
Sep 13 13:15:42 quantumsummers	heh, >30s
Sep 13 13:15:46 quantumsummers	whoops
Sep 13 13:15:49 quantumsummers	<30s
Sep 13 13:16:04 likewhoa	brb let me call him now
Sep 13 13:16:14 quantumsummers	the intro music only lasts like 10s anyway
Sep 13 13:16:38 dabbott	current /usr/share/sounds/login.wav is 0.05
Sep 13 13:17:44 quantumsummers	ok. anything else on this point or other business?
Sep 13 13:18:01 quantumsummers	if not I will open the floor ...
Sep 13 13:18:41 robbat2|na	likewhoa, i checked up on my music terminology, and chillout/downtempo/ambient is what I think would be good
Sep 13 13:18:50 quantumsummers	+1
Sep 13 13:19:05 tsunam	robbat2|na: you just sounded like such a geek
Sep 13 13:19:13 robbat2|na	but maybe psytrance too
Sep 13 13:19:20 quantumsummers	++!
Sep 13 13:19:45 robbat2|na	i know a couple of electronic DJ's
Sep 13 13:20:04 robbat2|na	but I value my hearing too much to go to their shows
Sep 13 13:20:15 robbat2|na	just wait for private parties instead
Sep 13 13:20:31 quantumsummers	you can get nice earplugs with acoustic tuning ...
Sep 13 13:20:48 bonsaikitten	quantumsummers: then you're functionally deaf and won't hear the music either
Sep 13 13:21:09 quantumsummers	hey, not with the musicians ear plugs ;)
Sep 13 13:21:16 *	bonsaikitten wishes people had working ears so that the loudness levels would be less than fatal
Sep 13 13:21:47 *	quantumsummers agrees with the cat
Sep 13 13:21:48 jmbsvicetto	so you know, we started talking about music mentioning 1492 or "Chariots of Fire" from Vangelis, "Also sprach Zarathustra" and then went all over the place ;)
Sep 13 13:22:03 robbat2|na	quantumsummers, yes, etyomic et al
Sep 13 13:22:06 quantumsummers	2001 would be awesome
Sep 13 13:22:23 quantumsummers	i.e. zarathustra
Sep 13 13:22:27 robbat2|na	jmbsvicetto, Vangelis, BT, some of Orbital, all good influences
Sep 13 13:22:35 quantumsummers	phish does a crazy interp
