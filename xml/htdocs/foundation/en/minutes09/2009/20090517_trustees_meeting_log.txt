(05/17/2009 02:00:38 PM) fmccor: OK.  Let's start.  tsunam is on vacation and
Toy is out collecting speeding tickets, so I guess we have robbat2
quantumsummers and me.
(05/17/2009 02:00:46 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, here?
(05/17/2009 02:01:25 PM) fmccor: Maybe we have quantumsummers ?
(05/17/2009 02:02:28 PM) fmccor: (Can't start until he checks back in.)
(05/17/2009 02:02:32 PM) MinnieBannister: I'm here sort of
(05/17/2009 02:02:45 PM) fmccor: MinnieBannister, meeting is now yours.
(05/17/2009 02:03:22 PM) MinnieBannister: my main display has packed up and I
only have ssh to my logger
(05/17/2009 02:03:32 PM) MinnieBannister: fmccor: please run the meeting
(05/17/2009 02:03:46 PM) fmccor: OK, do you count as here?
(05/17/2009 02:04:05 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers was here an hour ago but seems
to have disappeared.
(05/17/2009 02:04:29 PM) MinnieBannister: yes. I don't have any GUI, so I can't
see the agenda but I  can take part in discussion
(05/17/2009 02:05:08 PM) fmccor: First item is updated treasurer report, which
tsunam supplied last week.
(05/17/2009 02:05:15 PM) MinnieBannister: GNOME won't start on the netbook :(
(05/17/2009 02:05:33 PM) fmccor: Hm.
(05/17/2009 02:06:09 PM) MinnieBannister: fmccor: I've read it.  Hes made the
corretions the meeting asked. I move that it be adopted
(05/17/2009 02:06:31 PM) fmccor: second
(05/17/2009 02:06:36 PM) fmccor: robbat2, ?
(05/17/2009 02:06:40 PM) robbat2: i'm around
(05/17/2009 02:06:47 PM) robbat2: no objections to it
(05/17/2009 02:06:55 PM) fmccor: As to the motion, any comments?
(05/17/2009 02:07:01 PM) robbat2: none
(05/17/2009 02:07:05 PM) fmccor: Vote:
(05/17/2009 02:07:08 PM) ***fmccor yes
(05/17/2009 02:07:10 PM) robbat2: yes
(05/17/2009 02:07:15 PM) MinnieBannister: yes
(05/17/2009 02:07:33 PM) fmccor: OK, it's accepted as submitted.
(05/17/2009 02:07:57 PM) MinnieBannister: it needs to   get into the foundation
webspace
(05/17/2009 02:08:45 PM) fmccor: Yes, I'd expect tsunam or quantumsummers to put
it there.
(05/17/2009 02:08:51 PM) MinnieBannister: yep
(05/17/2009 02:09:05 PM) fmccor: I don't know where he's off to.
(05/17/2009 02:10:09 PM) MinnieBannister: next item ?
(05/17/2009 02:10:21 PM) fmccor: While we're on money, tsunam also asks
cafepress funds be sent to him or direct deposit.  I suggest we authorize him
to set that up.
(05/17/2009 02:10:24 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: hey hey, sorry I'm late
(05/17/2009 02:10:43 PM) fmccor: We've already given you one action item. :)
(05/17/2009 02:11:19 PM) fmccor: Unless there are objections, I move to
authorize tsunam to set that up with cafepress.
(05/17/2009 02:11:23 PM) MinnieBannister: fmccor: I prefer direct deposit as it
removes a single point of failure
(05/17/2009 02:11:48 PM) fmccor: I do too, it's just a matter of what cafepress
will do I think.
(05/17/2009 02:11:54 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: direct would be optimal
(05/17/2009 02:12:04 PM) robbat2: direct deposit if possible, otherwise switch
it to him
(05/17/2009 02:12:29 PM) fmccor: robbat2, I agree.  Could you put that in form
of a motion, please?
(05/17/2009 02:13:03 PM) fmccor: Anyone?
(05/17/2009 02:13:07 PM) robbat2: Motion: cafepress fund transfers to be change
to direct deposit into the Gentoo Foundation bank account if possible, and if
not possible, to be sent to the current treasurer
(05/17/2009 02:13:13 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: second
(05/17/2009 02:13:21 PM) MinnieBannister: vote ... yes
(05/17/2009 02:13:22 PM) fmccor: Vote?
(05/17/2009 02:13:24 PM) robbat2: yes
(05/17/2009 02:13:27 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: yes
(05/17/2009 02:13:27 PM) ***fmccor yes
(05/17/2009 02:13:31 PM) fmccor: carried.
(05/17/2009 02:13:58 PM) fmccor: Next item.  CPA --- quantumsummers 
(05/17/2009 02:14:03 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: regarding previous action item,
I take it those need to be in guidexml
(05/17/2009 02:14:48 PM) fmccor: The treasurer's report?  I suppose.
fmccor fmccor|away 
(05/17/2009 02:15:23 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: fmccor as well as the sec
report, or are those fine in plain html?
(05/17/2009 02:15:35 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, You also have the knowledge
base item, so please do both at once.
(05/17/2009 02:15:48 PM) robbat2: ideally guidexml to merge with the rest of the
website, but they can be in plain html if there's no other choice
(05/17/2009 02:16:08 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: CPA, we are in good shape
there. 501c3 app is moving along, should have draft for approval by June
meeting
(05/17/2009 02:16:10 PM) robbat2: there's some toplevel script stuff that sucks
out titles from guidexml
(05/17/2009 02:16:24 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: robbat2: I can guide 'em
(05/17/2009 02:16:34 PM) MinnieBannister: quantumsummers: leave them assss they
are - thats how they are/will be approved
(05/17/2009 02:17:18 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: MinnieBannister: as you wish.
(05/17/2009 02:17:50 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: any questions for the CPA or
regarding 1023 form?
(05/17/2009 02:18:03 PM) fmccor: Not I.
(05/17/2009 02:18:11 PM) robbat2: none from me
(05/17/2009 02:18:14 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I'll run it by the CPA before
submission, of course
(05/17/2009 02:18:18 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ok
(05/17/2009 02:18:44 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, Is Knowledge Management still
targeted for June?
(05/17/2009 02:18:50 PM) MinnieBannister: quantumsummers: where is the form ?
(05/17/2009 02:19:34 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: MinnieBannister:
http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1023/index.html
fmccor fmccor|away 
(05/17/2009 02:20:01 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: fmccor: on target for June
deployment of KMS
(05/17/2009 02:20:12 PM) MinnieBannister: quantumsummers: Ah, I thought you were
refering to  a completed form
(05/17/2009 02:20:35 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: MinnieBannister: I'm not
finished with it, only about 40%
(05/17/2009 02:20:40 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: its rather long
(05/17/2009 02:20:57 PM) fmccor: Fun.
(05/17/2009 02:21:09 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I think I can have it cleared
by CPA & presented to the board for June
(05/17/2009 02:21:22 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: approval & submission
(05/17/2009 02:21:28 PM) MinnieBannister: quantumsummers: take your time and get
it right
(05/17/2009 02:21:50 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: MinnieBannister: thanks, yes.
(05/17/2009 02:22:21 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I can pass the important stuff
around to you all if you want to assist in drafting sections
(05/17/2009 02:22:23 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: :)
(05/17/2009 02:22:34 PM) fmccor: Not really.
(05/17/2009 02:22:35 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: don't all jump up at once
(05/17/2009 02:22:38 PM) mode (+o NeddySeagoon ) by ChanServ
(05/17/2009 02:22:40 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: :D
(05/17/2009 02:22:58 PM) MinnieBannister: quantumsummers: As an outsider, I'm
interested
(05/17/2009 02:23:07 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: its cool, you will have to at
least read it before we vote on it
(05/17/2009 02:23:29 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: MinnieBannister: I can give
pretty fair directions on what is required
(05/17/2009 02:23:39 PM) NeddySeagoon: I have my main box going, so I'll swap
nicks here ...
(05/17/2009 02:23:42 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: beyond what the web site says
(05/17/2009 02:23:55 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, I need to understand it
to vote on it
(05/17/2009 02:24:00 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: nice work
(05/17/2009 02:24:09 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: yes, completely
understand
(05/17/2009 02:24:24 PM) fmccor: NeddySeagoon, you want the meeting now?
(05/17/2009 02:24:39 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ok, so if its at all possible I
will shoot to have some stuff for everyone to look at 2 weeks
(05/17/2009 02:24:39 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, no thanks ... just carry on
(05/17/2009 02:25:17 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, that will be good for me
and probably robbat2 as we are not US citizens
(05/17/2009 02:25:46 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: sounds good to
me, I think I can budget enough time to make that happen :)\
(05/17/2009 02:26:16 PM) fmccor: OK, next item is treasurer's report for FY
ending June 2008.  I haven't a clue on that and suggest we defer it for tsunam
unless someone knows.
(05/17/2009 02:27:06 PM) fmccor: Anyone?
(05/17/2009 02:27:14 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I thought that was what he
presented at the AGM
(05/17/2009 02:27:18 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, I suggest we scrap it, as its
almost June 2009 and roll it into one report
(05/17/2009 02:27:38 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: oh, whoops 2008__8__
(05/17/2009 02:27:38 PM) fmccor: That's fine with me.
(05/17/2009 02:27:40 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, our FY  ends om 30 June.  
(05/17/2009 02:27:51 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, I don't know, really.
(05/17/2009 02:28:22 PM) robbat2: the submitted one from before was up to March
31st
(05/17/2009 02:28:33 PM) NeddySeagoon: The original idea was to be able to
present accounts in July but with the banking issues, it didn't happen
(05/17/2009 02:28:35 PM) robbat2: he hasn't submitted the june info at all afaik
(05/17/2009 02:28:59 PM) fmccor: robbat2, What do you suggest?
(05/17/2009 02:29:04 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, was that march 31 08 or 09 ?
(05/17/2009 02:29:04 PM) robbat2: postpone
(05/17/2009 02:29:11 PM) robbat2: i'm not sure
(05/17/2009 02:29:15 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I'm planning to work with Josh
to get the data aggregated
(05/17/2009 02:29:16 PM) NeddySeagoon: I can go with postpone
(05/17/2009 02:29:28 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: postpone is fine with me
(05/17/2009 02:29:45 PM) fmccor: Done --- we'll keep it on the agenda.
(05/17/2009 02:30:09 PM) fmccor: (Don't think we need a motion to carry
something over.)
(05/17/2009 02:30:19 PM) NeddySeagoon: nope
(05/17/2009 02:30:38 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, Any more on knowledge
management? 
(05/17/2009 02:30:43 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: since the next thing is
mine,... I have now written & tested some code for tracking all the IP
infringers, and hook into gpgme to send the freakin emails to them. This way we
can easily track what has been done & their responses, etc. I will begin
sending these out on Monday, please be aware that you will have several emails
in your box due to this
(05/17/2009 02:31:01 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: this code will be integrated
into the KMS
(05/17/2009 02:31:27 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: same system I used to send out
the emails to all members
(05/17/2009 02:31:38 PM) fmccor: Sorry, I missed you when I moved on to
treasurer. :)
(05/17/2009 02:31:38 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: which will also be available
(05/17/2009 02:32:16 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, thanks.
(05/17/2009 02:32:23 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: its ok, I need to take some
responsibility for not getting the IP stuff done, this will take care of it
permanently
(05/17/2009 02:32:43 PM) fmccor: Yes, good thing.
(05/17/2009 02:32:58 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: robbat2: is it possible to
connect to a db on our infra via ssh tunnel?
(05/17/2009 02:33:20 PM) robbat2: which box?
(05/17/2009 02:33:29 PM) robbat2: the one I was going to give you for running
the KMS?
(05/17/2009 02:33:35 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: doesn't matter, I meant in
principle
(05/17/2009 02:33:43 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: or that yes
(05/17/2009 02:33:47 PM) robbat2: if the db is on our machines yes
(05/17/2009 02:33:52 PM) robbat2: if it's on the OSL db servers, no
(05/17/2009 02:34:25 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: basically, this email script
needs to have remote db access to hook into local gpg
(05/17/2009 02:34:47 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: or run the mail locally somehow
& have whoever sending sign it
(05/17/2009 02:35:01 PM) robbat2: we'll work out something
(05/17/2009 02:35:08 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ok, cool
(05/17/2009 02:35:30 PM) fmccor: Next --- carry-over?
(05/17/2009 02:35:36 PM) NeddySeagoon: yep
(05/17/2009 02:35:43 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: if needed I can always run this
off my infra until we can arrange a permanent solution 
(05/17/2009 02:37:06 PM) fmccor: First is trustees&Foundation article for GMN. 
We are now full strength, bug GMN is gone.  I think we should put together the
article now and consider how to publish it.
(05/17/2009 02:37:32 PM) robbat2: put the article together, the news blog will
take it
(05/17/2009 02:37:32 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I have been talking to
nightmorph about some guest articles on his gentoo news blog
(05/17/2009 02:37:43 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: robbat2: is that done?
(05/17/2009 02:37:56 PM) robbat2: just not live to my knowledge
(05/17/2009 02:38:13 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, heres what we have so far
http://dev.gentoo.org/~neddyseagoon/docs/trtrustees_GMN.xml
(05/17/2009 02:38:19 PM) fmccor: OK.  I'll have to update whatever I sent to
NeddySeagoon last year, although the picture is the same.
(05/17/2009 02:38:44 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ok, awesome. I volunteer to
write some :)
(05/17/2009 02:38:52 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, quantumsummers you need to do
bits too
(05/17/2009 02:39:04 PM) fmccor: Idea was that everyone would contribute.
(05/17/2009 02:39:11 PM) NeddySeagoon: I'm happy to put it together
(05/17/2009 02:39:26 PM) fmccor: What's a realistic target date?
(05/17/2009 02:39:26 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: great! I'll send you some text
(05/17/2009 02:39:38 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, and a picture.
(05/17/2009 02:39:38 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, and a photo ?
(05/17/2009 02:39:44 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: sure
(05/17/2009 02:39:49 PM) robbat2: sure
(05/17/2009 02:39:59 PM) ***robbat2 gets the feeling he may be the youngest
trustee
(05/17/2009 02:40:05 PM) NeddySeagoon: by the next meeting ?
(05/17/2009 02:40:22 PM) fmccor: Works for me.
(05/17/2009 02:40:22 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: I can do that
(05/17/2009 02:40:35 PM) NeddySeagoon: ok - thats the target
(05/17/2009 02:40:52 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: tgall - Secetarty - add mugshot
(05/17/2009 02:40:56 PM) fmccor: That'll be about June 14.
(05/17/2009 02:40:57 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: that is a good one
(05/17/2009 02:41:40 PM) NeddySeagoon: yep ... nobody wrote back about my
meetings calendar ...
(05/17/2009 02:42:00 PM) fmccor: So we'll have everything to NeddySeagoon by
mid-June.
(05/17/2009 02:42:23 PM) fmccor: Does tsunam need to be reminded or do you have
something from him?
(05/17/2009 02:42:34 PM) NeddySeagoon: he needs to be reminded
(05/17/2009 02:42:53 PM) fmccor: OK, that'll be in the minutes I guess.
(05/17/2009 02:43:15 PM) robbat2: NeddySeagoon, want to bring that calendar up
here quickly, so we can proclaim the dates now?
(05/17/2009 02:43:35 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, I was going to do it under AoB
(05/17/2009 02:43:41 PM) fmccor: OK.
(05/17/2009 02:43:42 PM) robbat2: ok
(05/17/2009 02:43:54 PM) robbat2: what's next?
(05/17/2009 02:44:18 PM) fmccor: Next is mine --- work with Gentoo e.V. .... 
Still awaiting action from Gentoo e.V.
(05/17/2009 02:44:22 PM) fmccor: No report.
(05/17/2009 02:45:07 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: seems like that is the case for
all the rest of the items in #3
(05/17/2009 02:45:10 PM) NeddySeagoon: its really in their hands ...
(05/17/2009 02:45:23 PM) fmccor: No --- I have updates.
(05/17/2009 02:45:31 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: aha
(05/17/2009 02:45:41 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: n IPR/trademark ?
(05/17/2009 02:46:30 PM) fmccor: Our domestic trademark attorney is changing who
is assigned to us.  So I should have more when I find out who that is.
(05/17/2009 02:46:54 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, heh ... news on the news
(05/17/2009 02:47:17 PM) fmccor: It might be reasonable to move all of the
trademark work to our Boston firm, depending on what the San Diego people do.
(05/17/2009 02:47:58 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, we can only wait and see
(05/17/2009 02:48:10 PM) fmccor: I infer the San Diego firm is in a bit of a
turmoil, but am not sure.
(05/17/2009 02:49:31 PM) fmccor: Anyway, the item is still pending and I am now
waiting to hear from San Diego.
(05/17/2009 02:49:38 PM) NeddySeagoon: next item ?
(05/17/2009 02:49:43 PM) fmccor: Open bugs.
(05/17/2009 02:50:12 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: whoohoo :)
(05/17/2009 02:50:24 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: #217511
(05/17/2009 02:50:29 PM) robbat2: bug 217511

(05/17/2009 02:50:52 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I think that one can be closed
since comprookie is helping out

(05/17/2009 02:51:15 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: we should perhaps consider a
tracker bug for the store to monitor progress
(05/17/2009 02:51:24 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, did that actually start ?
(05/17/2009 02:51:47 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: I thought so, I
wonder if we should make him staff & a login to the store
(05/17/2009 02:52:04 PM) comprookie2000: We are getting suggestions from the
forum post
(05/17/2009 02:52:04 PM) NeddySeagoon: comprookie2000, ping
(05/17/2009 02:52:12 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: hi David
(05/17/2009 02:52:17 PM) comprookie2000: hi
(05/17/2009 02:52:19 PM) NeddySeagoon: can we close the bug ?
(05/17/2009 02:52:31 PM) comprookie2000: yes
(05/17/2009 02:52:40 PM) NeddySeagoon: comprookie2000, are you working with
musikc on this
(05/17/2009 02:53:02 PM) comprookie2000: yes, she is very busy, but I do catch
her in irc
(05/17/2009 02:53:05 PM) fmccor: It's closed.
(05/17/2009 02:53:09 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, appoint a storekeeper you
mean ?
(05/17/2009 02:53:15 PM) NeddySeagoon: ok
(05/17/2009 02:53:27 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: yes
(05/17/2009 02:53:38 PM) comprookie2000: I think she would be OK with that
(05/17/2009 02:53:56 PM) NeddySeagoon: I'm not against that if it would help
(05/17/2009 02:54:17 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, So, you would like to add
comprookie2000 to your staff (or to tsunam's)?
fmccor fmccor|away 
(05/17/2009 02:54:42 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: fmccor both of us can work with
him
(05/17/2009 02:54:42 PM) fmccor: It's fine with me if comprookie2000 is
agreeable.
(05/17/2009 02:54:48 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, I would like tsunam to have some
say in it
(05/17/2009 02:54:57 PM) comprookie2000: Fine with me
(05/17/2009 02:55:11 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: comprookie2000: if you were to
take over the store, would you mind reporting to Josh & I. I think we'll just
need a csv from cafepress more or less
(05/17/2009 02:55:21 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: with the sales that is
(05/17/2009 02:55:39 PM) comprookie2000: sure
(05/17/2009 02:55:40 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I can coordinate things if
needed
(05/17/2009 02:55:53 PM) fmccor: OK, we'll take this up next meeting.  Until
then, I suggest quantumsummers and comprookie2000 and tsunam (when he gets
back) flesh out the position.
(05/17/2009 02:55:58 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: robbat2: you want to get into
the store at all, anyone else?
(05/17/2009 02:55:58 PM) NeddySeagoon: lets work out the details outside the
meeting ... we are agreed in principle
(05/17/2009 02:56:06 PM) robbat2: nope, i don't need in
(05/17/2009 02:56:12 PM) fmccor: Not me.
(05/17/2009 02:56:18 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: ?
(05/17/2009 02:56:34 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: want to play with the store?
(05/17/2009 02:56:36 PM) NeddySeagoon: I'll go with whatever you guys work out
(05/17/2009 02:57:02 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ok, sounds good. comprookie2000
you will receive an email from me & we can talk about it
(05/17/2009 02:57:07 PM) NeddySeagoon: no, I'll stay out of the store.  Did the
2006.0 CDs get dropped from the UK page ?
(05/17/2009 02:57:14 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, Can you and the others have
something to recommend at the next meeting and have a motion prepared?

used on the items
(05/17/2009 02:58:13 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: np
(05/17/2009 02:58:36 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I might have some new ones
too :)
(05/17/2009 02:58:45 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, the 2006.0 AMD64 CD is
still on the UK store
(05/17/2009 02:58:46 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: subject to approval of course

it's up to them to do it.
(05/17/2009 03:05:33 PM) fmccor: Feel free to add your thoughts to the bug too.

problem.  It's actually a nice program.

(05/17/2009 03:11:16 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: robbat2: yes. what do you think
is an appropriate amount? I would guess that <$1000 USD should do it
(05/17/2009 03:11:29 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, yeah, we want infra to just fix
stuff up to a 'reasonable value' but we need a number
(05/17/2009 03:11:44 PM) robbat2: $1000/year is fine by me.
(05/17/2009 03:12:05 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: we should not encourage
needless spending though ... I meant up to $1K per month available without a
vote
(05/17/2009 03:12:13 PM) NeddySeagoon: I move that we set a repairs budget for

the Gentoo Foundation, Inc." happened
(05/17/2009 03:31:42 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: yes it did

(05/17/2009 03:31:53 PM) fmccor: tanderson, not unless you are on the sender
list.  This came up during the election.
(05/17/2009 03:32:05 PM) robbat2: is fully integrated to our ultraDNS system
(05/17/2009 03:32:16 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: robbat2: have you been
reimbursed for the expense?
(05/17/2009 03:32:21 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, did you get reimbursed ?
(05/17/2009 03:32:42 PM) robbat2: i didn't bother to submit it before, i will if
you want me to
(05/17/2009 03:32:55 PM) tanderson: fmccor: ok
(05/17/2009 03:33:06 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: up to you, prob a good idea.

(05/17/2009 03:33:12 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, your call - Its a Foundation
expense but donations are always welcome
(05/17/2009 03:33:24 PM) fmccor: tanderson, Me, I don't care.  Fight with the
others. :)
(05/17/2009 03:33:47 PM) tanderson: fmccor: I don't care either, quantumsummers
can argue
(05/17/2009 03:34:12 PM) ***quantumsummers|Corsair removed occam's razor from
handy belt pouch
(05/17/2009 03:34:25 PM) fmccor: tanderson, what the election officials was send
mail to trustees@ who would send it on and approve their own mail.
(05/17/2009 03:34:39 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: tanderson: you can just send it
to the trustees alias
(05/17/2009 03:34:46 PM) tanderson: Then I can live with that as well

(05/17/2009 03:35:43 PM) fmccor: I'll comment on the bug in a bit, but here's
the status as to date.
(05/17/2009 03:36:09 PM) fmccor: Lawyers gave a conditional OK, depending on
whether the web site looked real or not.
(05/17/2009 03:36:36 PM) fmccor: klieber's wife knows Russian and so far as she
can tell, they're legitimate.
(05/17/2009 03:37:03 PM) NeddySeagoon: what about protecting our mark in
Kazakhstan?
(05/17/2009 03:37:46 PM) fmccor: They did not comment on that.  I told them the
site looked real but have not heard back.
(05/17/2009 03:38:19 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, ok, held over  until we know how
our trademark will be protected
(05/17/2009 03:38:48 PM) NeddySeagoon: 5. New Licence Applications
(05/17/2009 03:38:57 PM) fmccor: I'll nudge the lawyer involved a bit.  I can't
push too hard since we are not actually paying them.

(05/17/2009 03:39:07 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, ok
(05/17/2009 03:39:34 PM) NeddySeagoon: I vote we go with the offer from 
Techiant LLC as per the email
(05/17/2009 03:40:07 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: Techiant: can we get a printed
+ signed copy of your proposal for our records?
(05/17/2009 03:40:23 PM) Techiant: Sure, if you could email me the address.
(05/17/2009 03:40:29 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I second NeddySeagoon'S motion
(05/17/2009 03:40:43 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, why not a digitally
signed email ? 
fmccor fmccor|away 
(05/17/2009 03:40:54 PM) Techiant: can do
(05/17/2009 03:41:11 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: fmccor is that sufficient, a
dig signed mail?
(05/17/2009 03:41:13 PM) NeddySeagoon: fmccor, robbat2 ?  ^^
(05/17/2009 03:41:26 PM) Techiant: how about scanned pdf?
(05/17/2009 03:41:32 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: its fine with me
(05/17/2009 03:41:36 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, people lose stuff on
paper
(05/17/2009 03:41:42 PM) robbat2: scan the pdf and gpg sign it :-)
(05/17/2009 03:41:49 PM) robbat2: err, scan to pdf
(05/17/2009 03:41:50 PM) NeddySeagoon: heh
(05/17/2009 03:41:51 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: I would digitize
it, of course
(05/17/2009 03:42:02 PM) Techiant: :)
(05/17/2009 03:42:04 PM) fmccor: quantumsummers, it's fine with me.
(05/17/2009 03:42:08 PM) Techiant: I'll give you a good copy
(05/17/2009 03:42:16 PM) robbat2: signing it both ways covers us in all cases

send us an email when you are ready to sell them?
(05/17/2009 03:43:06 PM) comprookie2000: Techiant, Aluminum and domed?
(05/17/2009 03:43:13 PM) NeddySeagoon: Techiant, you are in business with your
badges.  Other items need other approvals.  Good luck
(05/17/2009 03:43:21 PM) ***quantumsummers|Corsair wants a few :)
(05/17/2009 03:43:39 PM) Techiant: Domed, flat vinyl (notebook style0, mirror
gold/silver brushed gold/silver. No aluminum
(05/17/2009 03:43:42 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: still looking for a vendor to
make the belt buckles though
(05/17/2009 03:43:49 PM) NeddySeagoon: Use Logo in the Gentoo Package Manager
Specification
(05/17/2009 03:44:11 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: NeddySeagoon: so you have a
link to something describing what that is all about?
(05/17/2009 03:44:45 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: this is a document, correct?
(05/17/2009 03:44:50 PM) fmccor: Yes.
(05/17/2009 03:44:57 PM) NeddySeagoon: quantumsummers, its in your trustees@
email.  USe of the G logo in a create commons document
(05/17/2009 03:45:04 PM) Techiant: are we good with flat notebook stickers, or
what would be a procedure for approving new designs/products?
(05/17/2009 03:45:27 PM) NeddySeagoon: Techiant, were they in your email ?
(05/17/2009 03:45:58 PM) NeddySeagoon: and your link
(05/17/2009 03:46:34 PM) Techiant: There were a few objections in the previous
chat re; other products, I think
(05/17/2009 03:47:29 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: Techiant: the laptop sticker is
like the vista sticker on new PCs right, 1 inch x 3/4/ inch or so?
(05/17/2009 03:47:31 PM) NeddySeagoon: Techiant, If they were in your link in
your original email, they are covered. You may not add new products without a
new application
(05/17/2009 03:47:55 PM) Techiant: I proposed other products we can make in
email as "can be pre-approved with Gentoo Foundation" but not sure what the
procedure will be
(05/17/2009 03:48:08 PM) Techiant: quantumsummers: yes
(05/17/2009 03:49:06 PM) Techiant: NeddySeagoon: I see, badges onlythis time. I
will submit new application when we finalized which products we are going to do
(05/17/2009 03:50:01 PM) robbat2: err, i'd take the vista-sticker-like to be
case badges as well, just flat ones
(05/17/2009 03:50:09 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: same here
(05/17/2009 03:50:12 PM) comprookie2000: laptop sleeves have been asked for
(05/17/2009 03:50:12 PM) NeddySeagoon: robbat2, me too
(05/17/2009 03:50:28 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: comprookie2000: I like that
idea
(05/17/2009 03:51:10 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: Techiant: so you are good with
the case badges, both the domed & flat ones
(05/17/2009 03:51:11 PM) NeddySeagoon: We need to see designs ... blanket
approval for anything is too close to public domain for my liking
(05/17/2009 03:51:18 PM) Techiant: so can we agree that case badges include:
domed or undomed, PC or laptop logo stickers?
(05/17/2009 03:51:37 PM) NeddySeagoon: Techiant, I'm happy with that
(05/17/2009 03:52:09 PM) Techiant: great. I will submit other stuff (usb jump
drive, laptop skins next time
(05/17/2009 03:52:10 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: Techiant: if you are unsure at
any point just send us an email & we will respond promptly
(05/17/2009 03:52:23 PM) Techiant: will do. thanks guys
(05/17/2009 03:52:51 PM) Techiant: and I will await for emal re: gentoo store
linking. Will also email signed PDF
(05/17/2009 03:53:41 PM) NeddySeagoon: Techiant, the link on gentoo.org is
something we need to discuss for all licenced vendors
(05/17/2009 03:54:12 PM) NeddySeagoon: The email about our logo in the PMS was
message ID <20090416074036.25ed88dc@terra.solaris>
