(03/22/2009 02:03:29 PM) BlueBottle: Certified Public Accountant - quantumsummers
(03/22/2009 02:03:49 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: CPA says we do not have to file taxes this year since we made <$25K
(03/22/2009 02:04:04 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I have started filling out the 1023 for 501c3 status
(03/22/2009 02:04:15 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: there is a small potential issue
(03/22/2009 02:04:28 PM) BlueBottle: ?
(03/22/2009 02:04:28 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: since the foundation has been around for more than 24 months
(03/22/2009 02:04:46 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: the irs might audit/fine us
(03/22/2009 02:04:57 PM) tsunam: hmm?
(03/22/2009 02:04:59 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: but its not a guarantee
(03/22/2009 02:05:11 PM) BlueBottle: we did not intend 501c when we were founded
(03/22/2009 02:05:20 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: doesn't matter
(03/22/2009 02:05:29 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: that's a fed law
(03/22/2009 02:05:36 PM) BlueBottle: thats a change of intent/direction
(03/22/2009 02:05:46 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: if you become a nfp ni a state, you are supposed to become a 501
(03/22/2009 02:05:52 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: not necessarily a c3
(03/22/2009 02:05:58 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: there are other types
(03/22/2009 02:06:15 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: but we want to be comsidered a charity for tax/donation reasons
(03/22/2009 02:06:18 PM) BlueBottle: yeah, 501 was intended but another type
(03/22/2009 02:06:22 PM) fmccor|home: We started out to be c6 for some reason.
(03/22/2009 02:06:39 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: donors get 0 tax break for c6
(03/22/2009 02:06:56 PM) tsunam: yep
(03/22/2009 02:07:00 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: maybe the thought was that we wouldn't qualify for c3
(03/22/2009 02:07:05 PM) BlueBottle: we probaly need a full session on 503c and what it means
(03/22/2009 02:07:06 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: but we do
(03/22/2009 02:07:23 PM) ***jmbsvicetto peeks in

(03/22/2009 02:07:47 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: 'course all the info is on the web, see the link from my manifesto
(03/22/2009 02:07:53 PM) fmccor|home: There was a reason at the time, but c6 is for things like baseball teams.
(03/22/2009 02:07:54 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, we shoulf set that up in April, with the new trustees
(03/22/2009 02:08:05 PM) jmbsvicetto: Hi everyone
(03/22/2009 02:08:12 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: yes, let do that

(03/22/2009 02:09:15 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I haven't done that yet, the tattoos on the inside of my eyelids must have worn off
(03/22/2009 02:09:37 PM) BlueBottle: Now we know our copyright is good in the EU and the US, we should add the EU to that list.  I don't think Gentoo e.V. would mind
(03/22/2009 02:09:37 PM) ***quantumsummers|Corsair gets out the permanent marker again
(03/22/2009 02:09:55 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: fine with me

(03/22/2009 02:11:04 PM) tsunam: I need to update the documents actually. I have all the info now, managed to grab it for quantumsummers for the cpa
(03/22/2009 02:11:30 PM) BlueBottle: tsunam, and the web pages ?
(03/22/2009 02:11:40 PM) tsunam: that's what I was implying =)
(03/22/2009 02:11:48 PM) BlueBottle: sorry

(03/22/2009 02:12:47 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I gave him a target in June for deploy
(03/22/2009 02:12:58 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: so far we have:
(03/22/2009 02:13:03 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: membership
(03/22/2009 02:13:07 PM) BlueBottle: sounds good.
(03/22/2009 02:13:08 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: basic accounting
(03/22/2009 02:13:14 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: wiki
(03/22/2009 02:13:20 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: tasks
(03/22/2009 02:13:32 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: action items from meetings with milestones
(03/22/2009 02:13:40 PM) BlueBottle: SOPs?
(03/22/2009 02:13:46 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: working on guidexml integration 
(03/22/2009 02:14:15 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: SOP = standard operating procedures?
(03/22/2009 02:14:16 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: yes
(03/22/2009 02:14:20 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: basic though
(03/22/2009 02:14:23 PM) BlueBottle: there is more than enough there to roll it out, it can be added to
(03/22/2009 02:14:39 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: sure
(03/22/2009 02:14:40 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, yes
(03/22/2009 02:14:54 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: working on some further integration for projects

(03/22/2009 02:15:24 PM) jmbsvicetto: quantumsummers: ?
(03/22/2009 02:15:36 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: care to make a statement regarding the election?
(03/22/2009 02:15:52 PM) BlueBottle: rane, brought up a good point. We have no mechanism for dropping members in the bylaws
(03/22/2009 02:15:54 PM) jmbsvicetto: Sorry, I'm a bit lost. What type of statement?
(03/22/2009 02:16:21 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: I propose the board establish an SOP for this
(03/22/2009 02:16:44 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, keep going ... what should it say
(03/22/2009 02:16:44 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: jmbsvicetto: just on the progress, and anything you have noticed that is going well or ill
(03/22/2009 02:17:14 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: ok, so basically there could be a vote every month, like for new members
(03/22/2009 02:17:42 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: the criterion for dismissal should be simple, MIA for X time unit
(03/22/2009 02:18:04 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: MIA to be determined similar to the way that MIA devs are retired
(03/22/2009 02:18:13 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: something to that effect
(03/22/2009 02:18:27 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: could add a "slacker" mark for not voting, etc
(03/22/2009 02:18:41 PM) jmbsvicetto: About the current election? There were some complaints about people not realizing the election was on until it was time to vote. In my view, anyone not subscribed to the gentoo-nfp ml, doesn't have a good case. Having the foundation-announce ml before the election started would have been a great thing, but it just wasn't possible
(03/22/2009 02:19:07 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: jmbsvicetto: what is the turnout?
(03/22/2009 02:19:16 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: so far
(03/22/2009 02:19:31 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: last I heard it was ~62 or so
(03/22/2009 02:19:32 PM) jmbsvicetto: There were a few doubts about the voting procedures and we've identified one voter that wasn't in the list (but the voter only noticed that 2 days ago). The rest seems to be going fine
(03/22/2009 02:19:40 PM) jmbsvicetto: 63
(03/22/2009 02:20:01 PM) jmbsvicetto: 17:32 <+rane> anyway, 63 votes so far  <- almost 3 hours ago
(03/22/2009 02:20:04 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ok, that's good.
(03/22/2009 02:20:17 PM) fmccor|home: About a third?
(03/22/2009 02:20:29 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, I don't see what MIA means for the foundation.  Members get to vote and keep their emails up to date.
(03/22/2009 02:20:30 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: somehow I missed tupone, but that's taken care of now
(03/22/2009 02:20:57 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: MIA would need a solid definition
(03/22/2009 02:21:16 PM) BlueBottle: I propose that MIA means two missed elections. Members not wishing to vote can rank all candiates equally
(03/22/2009 02:21:41 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I forsee greater communication from the foundation in the future, thus I would push for addition to that criterion
(03/22/2009 02:21:43 PM) BlueBottle: fmccor, tsunam ^^
(03/22/2009 02:22:14 PM) fmccor|home: Fine with me.  I thought we already had it?
(03/22/2009 02:22:16 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, me too, so we can change the critera
(03/22/2009 02:22:35 PM) jmbsvicetto: 63 out of 206
(03/22/2009 02:22:38 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: sounds good
(03/22/2009 02:22:51 PM) tsunam: sure
(03/22/2009 02:22:51 PM) BlueBottle: fmccor, it was changed to 'as determined by the trustees from time to time'
(03/22/2009 02:23:07 PM) fmccor|home: My mistake.
(03/22/2009 02:23:16 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: that is the nice thing, its up to the board
(03/22/2009 02:23:49 PM) BlueBottle: It will apply from this election, so the first members dropped will be after the 2010 election
(03/22/2009 02:24:08 PM) BlueBottle: can we have a vote please
(03/22/2009 02:24:32 PM) fmccor|home: Yes.
(03/22/2009 02:24:40 PM) BlueBottle: yes
(03/22/2009 02:24:40 PM) jmbsvicetto: fmccor|home: when you get to the AOB, please ping me (about that qt license issue)
(03/22/2009 02:24:50 PM) BlueBottle: tsunam, ^^
(03/22/2009 02:24:56 PM) tsunam: I'm fine with it
(03/22/2009 02:25:10 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: vote recorded, all in favor
(03/22/2009 02:25:30 PM) BlueBottle: carried.   quantumsummers add it to the SOP please
(03/22/2009 02:25:47 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: BlueBottle: done
(03/22/2009 02:25:51 PM) fmccor|home: jmbsvicetto, What qt license issue?  Did I miss something?

(03/22/2009 02:27:51 PM) tsunam: any reimbusement is fixed once we have a bank
(03/22/2009 02:27:52 PM) BlueBottle: tsunam, have you paid yourself /
(03/22/2009 02:27:58 PM) tsunam: short answer is no
(03/22/2009 02:27:59 PM) BlueBottle: ok
(03/22/2009 02:28:26 PM) BlueBottle: comprookie2000, I'll check the thread later ... it sounds like progress
(03/22/2009 02:28:43 PM) comprookie2000: also updated the bug with some info

(03/22/2009 02:30:53 PM) BlueBottle: any progress ?
(03/22/2009 02:30:55 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: having chatted with robbat, Ramereth, solar, & fox2mike, this will be rather fluid.
(03/22/2009 02:31:22 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: they liked the idea of a budget, but non could agree on an amount
(03/22/2009 02:31:51 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, add up all the estimates and devide by the number of estimators = budget
(03/22/2009 02:32:10 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: I would think that $1K would do it, as that would cover the cost of the expensive parts like raid controllers
(03/22/2009 02:32:20 PM) BlueBottle: we just need a number and some rational
(03/22/2009 02:32:27 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: likely it would be smaller purchases like HDDs
(03/22/2009 02:32:52 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: both robbat & solar have some ideas regarding infra spending
(03/22/2009 02:33:01 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: some new servers, etc
(03/22/2009 02:33:05 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: esp git.g.o
(03/22/2009 02:33:12 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: that one will cost some $$$
(03/22/2009 02:33:41 PM) BlueBottle: quantumsummers, we could say that purchases of replacement parts are ok and not set a number ...  it leaves us wide open to a bad year
(03/22/2009 02:33:58 PM) BlueBottle: new kit is excluded
(03/22/2009 02:34:09 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: sure, I had suggested $1K/month availability

(03/22/2009 02:38:51 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: unless someone can buy it & be reimbursed
(03/22/2009 02:39:01 PM) tsunam: basically paypal's being a pain in the arse :(

(03/22/2009 02:40:44 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: had a nice talk with a dude over there
(03/22/2009 02:40:54 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: everythin else is in line
(03/22/2009 02:41:04 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: just need the bank
(03/22/2009 02:41:20 PM) tsunam: quantumsummers: said they just stored all the other information in a funky place so didn't realize it

(03/22/2009 02:46:20 PM) BlueBottle: we will need reports from officers ...
(03/22/2009 02:46:29 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: indeed
(03/22/2009 02:46:34 PM) tsunam: k
(03/22/2009 02:46:42 PM) fmccor|home: Could we make this a single topic planning session?  
(03/22/2009 02:47:00 PM) ***fmccor|home is running short of time.
(03/22/2009 02:47:10 PM) BlueBottle: fmccor, when ? the AGM will be April 12th ?
(03/22/2009 02:47:11 PM) fmccor|home: Apologies.

(03/22/2009 02:48:34 PM) BlueBottle: We dont have auditors and remumeration to conside
(03/22/2009 02:48:36 PM) fmccor|home: Easy enough, then.
(03/22/2009 02:48:49 PM) BlueBottle: yeah - if we do the prep

(03/22/2009 02:49:49 PM) tsunam: don't see a problem with it for me
(03/22/2009 02:49:55 PM) BlueBottle: ping jmbsvicetto 
(03/22/2009 02:49:58 PM) BlueBottle: fmccor, ?
(03/22/2009 02:50:02 PM) fmccor|home: I'll outline my report for review.  It's all legal stuff and will put everyone to sleep. 
(03/22/2009 02:50:09 PM) BlueBottle: hehe
(03/22/2009 02:50:16 PM) jmbsvicetto: pong
(03/22/2009 02:50:32 PM) BlueBottle: Any Other Business
(03/22/2009 02:50:36 PM) BlueBottle: jmbsvicetto, 
(03/22/2009 02:50:38 PM) fmccor|home: Should be fine.  That's what --- two weeks?
(03/22/2009 02:50:43 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: 3
(03/22/2009 02:50:52 PM) jmbsvicetto: ok, how involved do you guys want to be with licensing issues in the tree?
(03/22/2009 02:51:27 PM) fmccor|home: Only if we're in violation, I think.
(03/22/2009 02:51:33 PM) jmbsvicetto: I don't know if you read hwoarang's mail to the dev ml about the perforce license
(03/22/2009 02:51:41 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: not I
(03/22/2009 02:51:46 PM) jmbsvicetto: fmccor|home: ok, but who can determine that? ;)
(03/22/2009 02:51:47 PM) fmccor|home: No.
(03/22/2009 02:51:50 PM) BlueBottle: jmbsvicetto, The only ones I'm aware of are some no free fonts and a crypto app licence
(03/22/2009 02:52:14 PM) jmbsvicetto: Oh and then there's also that thread by luke-jr about having deps on non-free licenses in the tree
(03/22/2009 02:52:56 PM) BlueBottle: jmbsvicetto, we need to be aware of them all, the writ will land here
(03/22/2009 02:53:02 PM) fmccor|home: The crypto app license is fine, as long as we force the users to fetch source themselves.  The ebuild is broken, though.
(03/22/2009 02:53:05 PM) tsunam: yep it will
(03/22/2009 02:53:13 PM) jmbsvicetto: Part of luke-jr mail was about kdelibs having a dep on deja-vu (a Gentoo dep and not upstream dep) and his conviction that deja-vu doesn't have an open-source license because you can't seel the font
(03/22/2009 02:53:41 PM) jmbsvicetto: Is there anyone we can ask to "clarify" issues with licenses?
(03/22/2009 02:53:42 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: seel?
(03/22/2009 02:53:54 PM) jmbsvicetto: sorry, s/seel/sell/
(03/22/2009 02:53:58 PM) quantumsummers|Corsair: ah
(03/22/2009 02:54:35 PM) jmbsvicetto: As the KDE lead, I would like to get an "informed" opinion about both licenses
(03/22/2009 02:54:35 PM) fmccor|home: jmbsvicetto, Start with me.  I can actually read those things.
(03/22/2009 02:54:42 PM) jmbsvicetto: ok
(03/22/2009 02:54:53 PM) BlueBottle: we probably need a bug about non-free licences
(03/22/2009 02:54:56 PM) jmbsvicetto: Ferris, in that case I'll talk to you after the meeting about it
(03/22/2009 02:55:17 PM) BlueBottle: we need a record of what happens
(03/22/2009 02:55:25 PM) jmbsvicetto: A general question, should we (is there any interest in that?) do an "audit" of licenses in the tree?
(03/22/2009 02:55:34 PM) BlueBottle: Any more 'other business' ?
(03/22/2009 02:55:37 PM) fmccor|home: Not today, I'm afraid.  I'm really out of time.  Family issues came up.
(03/22/2009 02:55:42 PM) jmbsvicetto: fmccor|home: sure
(03/22/2009 02:55:50 PM) jmbsvicetto: fmccor|home: poke me when you're available, please
(03/22/2009 02:55:56 PM) BlueBottle: Open Floor ...
(03/22/2009 02:56:05 PM) fmccor|home: Should be tomorrow.
(03/22/2009 02:56:42 PM) ***BlueBottle declares the meeting closed
