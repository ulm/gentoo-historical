Aug 16 12:10:53 NeddySeagoon	Trustees and Foundation Article For the News Feed -All.  I suggest we put that on hold while we are under strength ... is that ok
Aug 16 12:11:01 quantumsummers	yes, that is ok with me
Aug 16 12:11:07 robbat2	+1
Aug 16 12:11:38 NeddySeagoon	We should take fmccors name off the Trustee list on foundation.gentoo.org
Aug 16 12:12:04 robbat2	there's a retirement bug open for him, that I expect to process today
Aug 16 12:12:11 robbat2	which will cover all the web stuff too
Aug 16 12:12:12 quantumsummers	yes, also we need to attend to the official names on the NM site at some point
Aug 16 12:12:17 NeddySeagoon	Talk to Lawyers about fees and impact of 501c3 staus - fmccor.  This one is difficult.  Do we have a contact in Boston ?
Aug 16 12:12:38 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, ok
Aug 16 12:12:46 quantumsummers	I searched thru mails for this & I couldn't find out who the new on is
Aug 16 12:12:54 robbat2	might rl03 know?
Aug 16 12:13:01 NeddySeagoon	maybe
Aug 16 12:13:01 quantumsummers	we have contacts for the old firms, perhaps
Aug 16 12:13:36 quantumsummers	seems that the firm rl103 had us hooked up to fell thru or something
Aug 16 12:13:49 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, I do know that the contact in the West coast firm is no longer with them
Aug 16 12:13:49 quantumsummers	seems he was the only one who new what the deal was
Aug 16 12:14:05 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: yes
Aug 16 12:14:24 quantumsummers	ok, then we must try to fugyre out who Boston was
Aug 16 12:14:31 quantumsummers	wow, *figure
Aug 16 12:14:38 NeddySeagoon	fmccor was going to talk with Boston about fees. They were not keen on pro-bono
Aug 16 12:15:05 quantumsummers	seems that is what we are going to face until we have 501c3, then there is incentive
Aug 16 12:15:14 NeddySeagoon	I don't think it has fallen through totally
Aug 16 12:15:48 NeddySeagoon	Its the general problem with the world wide economy
Aug 16 12:16:10 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, does this fall in with the 503(c) stuff?
Aug 16 12:16:11 quantumsummers	we can afford the proposed fees without issue
Aug 16 12:16:23 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: in terms of the legal?
Aug 16 12:16:40 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, yes - can you look after it meanwhile ?
Aug 16 12:17:11 quantumsummers	I was merely stating that a firm would be more likely to do pro bono for a proper nfp
Aug 16 12:17:25 NeddySeagoon	contact rl03 etc. trawl the alias ...
Aug 16 12:17:40 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, agreed
Aug 16 12:17:47 quantumsummers	yes, I can look after it, I have lawyer colleagues that specialize in nfp if we need to
Aug 16 12:18:29 NeddySeagoon	thank you.  We need to try to get in touch with Boston anyway, to let them know we have not just disappeared
Aug 16 12:18:54 quantumsummers	you bet, I will see what I can do, else we can move to another firm
Aug 16 12:19:05 NeddySeagoon	I think fmccor forwarded some stuff to the alias but I can't search it until the weekend
Aug 16 12:19:23 NeddySeagoon	Write to www.linuxcenter.kz to inform them of approval - quantumsummers
Aug 16 12:19:26 quantumsummers	I'm searching again, I recall an email he forwarded, but cannot locate it currently
Aug 16 12:19:37 quantumsummers	I have a question about the .kz
Aug 16 12:19:45 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, leave it until later
Aug 16 12:19:53 quantumsummers	leave what?
Aug 16 12:19:53 NeddySeagoon	serching ..
Aug 16 12:19:56 quantumsummers	ok
Aug 16 12:20:04 NeddySeagoon	what about the .kz ?
Aug 16 12:20:33 quantumsummers	re. .kz, did we agree on the terms for them regarding donation? I did not have that in my notes
Aug 16 12:20:41 quantumsummers	was it 10%?
Aug 16 12:20:50 *	quantumsummers drops ball
Aug 16 12:22:04 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, I recall that they made us an offer, which we accepted
Aug 16 12:22:31 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, Its in one of their emails
Aug 16 12:22:46 quantumsummers	ok, I have a draft finished, I just need the number
Aug 16 12:22:52 *	quantumsummers looks
Aug 16 12:22:53 NeddySeagoon	ok
Aug 16 12:23:46 NeddySeagoon	The Year Ahead ... we are a bit on the back foot now, lets cancel this item.  We are half way though the year anyway
Aug 16 12:23:58 quantumsummers	ok
Aug 16 12:24:32 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, you ok with ^^ ?
Aug 16 12:24:35 robbat2	+1
Aug 16 12:24:37 NeddySeagoon	Actions From Previous Meetings on hold for one or more actions above ..
Aug 16 12:24:56 *	DrBonsaiPudding is now known as bonsaikitten
Aug 16 12:25:02 robbat2	who's wants to pick up working with the e.V. now that fmccor has passed?
Aug 16 12:25:16 NeddySeagoon	Fix name and address on IPR/trademark documents, 31 Aug 2008 meeting authorised the $200 fees - fmccor  is the only one that may have moved.  IF so, we will have had a bill for the fee
Aug 16 12:25:40 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, I will until we are back to strenght
Aug 16 12:25:46 robbat2	NeddySeagoon, thx

Aug 16 12:26:46 quantumsummers	s/to/the
Aug 16 12:26:58 NeddySeagoon	its not onourous at the moment.  we just ask dertobi123
Aug 16 12:27:23 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, which one ?
Aug 16 12:27:27 quantumsummers	Choate
Aug 16 12:27:33 quantumsummers	IP stuff
Aug 16 12:27:37 NeddySeagoon	Ah, the Boston one
Aug 16 12:27:45 quantumsummers	yes, I am fairly certain
Aug 16 12:27:53 robbat2	great
Aug 16 12:28:33 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, can you contact them to explain what happened and ask how we should proceed, or something like that
Aug 16 12:28:41 quantumsummers	sure can
Aug 16 12:29:22 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, thanks.  If they talk about fees, listen and report back. You must not commit the Foundation
Aug 16 12:29:30 quantumsummers	Heather E. Balmat  of  Choate Hall & Stewart LLP http://choate.com/people.php?PeopleID=13
Aug 16 12:29:38 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: yes I will do so
Aug 16 12:29:45 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, ok
Aug 16 12:30:36 quantumsummers	Perhaps I can coordinate some with the lawyers & the cpa to assist in our 501c3 as well. Worth a chat anyway
Aug 16 12:30:43 NeddySeagoon	Open Bugs Assigned to Trustees ... that was on me.  The new store page is up with all the stores I know about
Aug 16 12:30:58 quantumsummers	nice one Neddy, thanks
Aug 16 12:30:59 NeddySeagoon	I still have to move the CDs/DVD vendors there
Aug 16 12:31:16 NeddySeagoon	it won't be this week
Aug 16 12:31:27 robbat2	i can probably move them
Aug 16 12:31:39 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, thanks
Aug 16 12:32:10 NeddySeagoon	5  New Licence Applications   * None
Aug 16 12:32:19 NeddySeagoon	6 Membership Applications    * None
Aug 16 12:32:47 NeddySeagoon	7. Treasurers Report for FY ending 30 June 2009 - tsunam    skip that as tsunam is not here
Aug 16 12:33:08 NeddySeagoon	8. Date of Next Meeting - Sunday 13th September 2009 at 1900 UTC
Aug 16 12:33:19 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, quantumsummers is that ok ?
Aug 16 12:33:22 quantumsummers	should be ok, 
Aug 16 12:33:30 robbat2	i'm not 100% certain re that time yet
Aug 16 12:33:39 robbat2	i may have to get a friend to the airport that day
Aug 16 12:33:46 quantumsummers	my wife & I have bday's the 11th & 12th
Aug 16 12:33:57 robbat2	so maybe just push an hour or two, i'll update when I know
Aug 16 12:34:28 quantumsummers	pushing an hour will put NeddySeagoon up too late I suspect
Aug 16 12:35:19 quantumsummers	as a side note, NeddySeagoon, would you mind emailing the alias with your general availability now that you are working on the road?
Aug 16 12:35:25 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, ok.  At the moment, we start at 20:00 my local time ... I'll offer 21:00 my time but I'll probably be up early for a flight the following day.  I don't mind earlier but you will still be in your bed :)
Aug 16 12:35:42 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, ok, I'll do that
Aug 16 12:36:00 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: thanks, just wanted it so I knew when to bug you ;)
Aug 16 12:36:31 NeddySeagoon	Shall we leave it  Sunday 13th September 2009 at 1900 UTC  meanwhile ?
Aug 16 12:36:40 quantumsummers	fine by me
Aug 16 12:36:47 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, ^
Aug 16 12:37:02 robbat2	yes
Aug 16 12:37:26 NeddySeagoon	9. Any other business
Aug 16 12:37:39 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, you always have something ?
Aug 16 12:38:36 quantumsummers	lol, hmm not today I think
Aug 16 12:38:40 NeddySeagoon	robbat2,  AoB ?
Aug 16 12:39:05 robbat2	nil
Aug 16 12:39:11 NeddySeagoon	I have one
Aug 16 12:39:21 quantumsummers	o_0
Aug 16 12:39:25 quantumsummers	:)
Aug 16 12:39:30 robbat2	(sorry, i've been distracted and so busy this week)
Aug 16 12:39:40 NeddySeagoon	We need to decide how we fill our vacancy. I suggest an election
Aug 16 12:40:11 quantumsummers	I see no problems with a special election, except its a lot of work for folks
Aug 16 12:40:23 robbat2	who was next in the previous voting?
Aug 16 12:41:19 robbat2	musikc and patrick were next, in that order
Aug 16 12:41:27 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, we don't do that. Its an election or an appointment by the trustees. We are not required to appoint from the previous list of candidates
Aug 16 12:41:53 robbat2	i think both of them are busy with other things anyway
Aug 16 12:42:03 NeddySeagoon	We can appoint any developer who is interested
Aug 16 12:42:11 robbat2	i was suggesting them as potential appointees
Aug 16 12:42:16 robbat2	not that we had to use them
Aug 16 12:42:25 NeddySeagoon	yeah ok
Aug 16 12:42:25 quantumsummers	perhaps we make a call to the community to test interest
Aug 16 12:42:50 quantumsummers	then if we get several folks interested we can either appoint or have a run off
Aug 16 12:43:00 robbat2	run off++
Aug 16 12:43:07 quantumsummers	sounds fine to ,e
Aug 16 12:43:10 quantumsummers	*\me
Aug 16 12:43:14 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, yes, thats a good idea.  we can put an announce out on the foundation list
Aug 16 12:43:32 quantumsummers	should go to -dev-announce as well
Aug 16 12:43:51 quantumsummers	nm
Aug 16 12:43:59 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, it shouldn't need to as all members are subscribed to the foundation list
Aug 16 12:44:18 quantumsummers	just realized which list you meant
Aug 16 12:44:20 robbat2	the foundation-announce
Aug 16 12:44:24 robbat2	vs gentoo-foundation
Aug 16 12:44:27 *	quantumsummers was thinking -nfp
Aug 16 12:44:43 robbat2	yeah, -nfp/-foundation, sorry
Aug 16 12:44:43 NeddySeagoon	I can do it next weekend unless someone else wants to do it sooner
Aug 16 12:44:52 quantumsummers	ah, which reminds me, I do have AoB
Aug 16 12:45:05 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, heh - I knew it - you never miss
Aug 16 12:45:18 quantumsummers	though I think it might be better handled in private atm
Aug 16 12:45:30 quantumsummers	robbat2: re your lengthy email to us
Aug 16 12:45:31 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, ok, put it on the alias then
Aug 16 12:45:47 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: sounds good
Aug 16 12:45:51 robbat2	i haven't finished editing it into a blogpost yet
Aug 16 12:46:03 quantumsummers	then shall we process the request for removal?
Aug 16 12:46:06 robbat2	yes
Aug 16 12:46:14 robbat2	removal accepted
Aug 16 12:46:17 quantumsummers	ok, NeddySeagoon, yes as well?
Aug 16 12:46:26 robbat2	shall we clarify here for the logs
Aug 16 12:46:36 quantumsummers	fine with me
Aug 16 12:46:45 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, yes.  there has been no retraction
Aug 16 12:47:07 robbat2	for clarification: Philantrop has requested removal from the foundation
Aug 16 12:47:18 quantumsummers	Philantrop: you are hereby removed from the foundation membership. Please allow 30 days to complete the removal from all Foundation media
Aug 16 12:47:18 robbat2	all present trustees have voted in favour of accepting
Aug 16 12:47:36 quantumsummers	indeed
Aug 16 12:47:43 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, 10 days - read the bylaws 
Aug 16 12:47:48 quantumsummers	whopps 
Aug 16 12:48:00 quantumsummers	yes, strike that, 10 days 
Aug 16 12:48:21 robbat2	i'll trim him from the -foundation-announce list, quantumsummers will you please update your rosters etc
Aug 16 12:48:41 NeddySeagoon	and voice here
Aug 16 12:49:01 quantumsummers	robbat2: yes, effective immediately. he is removed from the official list.
Aug 16 12:49:34 robbat2	quantumsummers, please PM me the address you had on file for him
Aug 16 12:49:35 NeddySeagoon	any more ?
Aug 16 12:49:38 robbat2	i don't find the address he emailed us from
Aug 16 12:49:51 quantumsummers	nope, not from me
Aug 16 12:49:58 quantumsummers	robbat2: just a sec
Aug 16 12:50:03 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, AoB ?
Aug 16 12:50:07 robbat2	none
Aug 16 12:50:28 NeddySeagoon	10 Open floor
Aug 16 12:50:34 NeddySeagoon	sinsun, your turn
Aug 16 12:50:41 sinsun	Yes
Aug 16 12:51:19 sinsun	NeddySeagoon: I'm still new. To compare these trustees, I'm still young.
Aug 16 12:51:48 NeddySeagoon	sinsun, to talk about Comdex
Aug 16 12:51:59 sinsun	I am Taiwanese. And as you know there're bunch Hardware manufactory.
Aug 16 12:52:06 robbat2	sinsun, on the 2009 exhibitor list, I didn't see sun at all. nor could we find any other open source companies (or even many non-hardware companies)
Aug 16 12:52:20 sinsun	Acer,Asus,HTC,tsmc........
Aug 16 12:52:33 robbat2	those are hardware companies
Aug 16 12:52:40 robbat2	what other non-hardware companies are there
Aug 16 12:52:43 sinsun	robbat2: yes, indeed
Aug 16 12:52:45 robbat2	as it seems primarily a hardware show
Aug 16 12:52:48 robbat2	not a software show
Aug 16 12:53:02 sinsun	actually, there're 3 display area
Aug 16 12:53:45 sinsun	Did I say how much for a display room?
Aug 16 12:54:07 robbat2	quantumsummers linked to the pricing
Aug 16 12:54:14 quantumsummers	bottom line: we cannot afford to go unless someone donates some serious cash to get the booth, man the booth, help with travel & accommodations. I would /love/ for Gentoo to show at something like this, but it is premature at this point, in my opinion.
Aug 16 12:54:20 rane	http://blog.canonical.com/?p=173
Aug 16 12:54:23 robbat2	http://www.computextaipei.com.tw/exhibitor/application.shtml#7
Aug 16 12:54:26 rane	they are there for three years already
Aug 16 12:54:59 sinsun	$3850 USD
Aug 16 12:55:13 quantumsummers	that is just a booth
Aug 16 12:55:20 robbat2	http://www.taiwanpcsources.com/computex2009exhibitors.htm <--- rane, they aren't on there
Aug 16 12:55:21 rane	well, we don't have 3850
Aug 16 12:55:28 rane	so there's little point discussing
Aug 16 12:55:31 sinsun	I'll tell them how to lower price for non-profit org.
Aug 16 12:55:33 quantumsummers	travel is really expensive as well as hotel, etc
Aug 16 12:55:42 rane	robbat2, Gerry Carr -  Head of Platform Marketing is signed under this post...
Aug 16 12:55:48 rane	robbat2, i doubt he's making it up:-|
Aug 16 12:55:55 quantumsummers	sinsun: if they can lower it to free, then we can talk
Aug 16 12:56:10 robbat2	rane, in that I agree with you, but i'm trying to find out who in the open source world actually goes
Aug 16 12:56:13 robbat2	definitively
Aug 16 12:56:22 sinsun	quantumsummers: to be free is too hard
Aug 16 12:56:48 sinsun	what brand would be sponser?
Aug 16 12:57:04 sinsun	posibbly
Aug 16 12:57:13 quantumsummers	to not be free to too expensive for the Foundation at this time. Once we have 501c3 status we can begin to raise enough money to do things like computex right
Aug 16 12:57:18 robbat2	rane, googling suggests that they gave a presentation, not that they had a booth
Aug 16 12:58:37 robbat2	sinsun, on the organization side
Aug 16 12:58:42 robbat2	even if the foundation did front the money
Aug 16 12:59:08 sinsun	robbat2: nod
Aug 16 12:59:10 robbat2	what support is there from the Gentoo.TW user (and dev?) base to man it and arrange it
Aug 16 12:59:28 robbat2	we don't want a repeat of some of the other expos
Aug 16 12:59:33 robbat2	where gentoo was given a space
Aug 16 12:59:35 sinsun	robbat2: gentoo-tw is full of MIS
Aug 16 12:59:36 robbat2	and nobody turned up
Aug 16 12:59:39 NeddySeagoon	sinsun, all the exhibitors have one thing in common. They exist to make money for their sharehoders.  Gentoo can make money but is not permitted to distribute it to its members. We are a not for profit organisation
**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Sun Aug 16 13:00:25 2009

Aug 16 13:00:25 sinsun	NeddySeagoon: You can't sell anything in Computex
Aug 16 13:00:29 NeddySeagoon	That means we don't make much money either
Aug 16 13:00:48 robbat2	no sales ("by donation") of shirts either?
Aug 16 13:00:48 sinsun	Trend is urge to search opensource support
Aug 16 13:01:10 sinsun	robbat2: it could happen
Aug 16 13:01:18 NeddySeagoon	sinsun, no, you line up sales for later from the publicity you get.
Aug 16 13:01:40 robbat2	"gentoo-tw is full of MIS": how many gentoo users in Taipei would be manning the booth? any developers?
Aug 16 13:01:56 NeddySeagoon	MIS ?
Aug 16 13:02:03 quantumsummers	sinsun: what is MIS?
Aug 16 13:02:19 sinsun	robbat2: hm, there're few developer and they are Debian guy.
Aug 16 13:02:46 robbat2	I don't think we even have any active developers in Japan anymore
Aug 16 13:02:56 robbat2	and the closest to Taiwan is r0bertz in Hong Kong
Aug 16 13:03:15 sinsun	quantumsummer: Management Information System, crap
Aug 16 13:03:30 robbat2	basically a degree in IT
Aug 16 13:03:44 quantumsummers	kk
Aug 16 13:03:53 sinsun	ya, r0bertz is in HK
Aug 16 13:04:02 *	quantumsummers apologizes, but must go very soon. Is there anything else I can be of assistance with?
Aug 16 13:04:08 sinsun	it's easier to held in HK
Aug 16 13:04:11 robbat2	quantumsummers, go, I think this will be only discussion
Aug 16 13:04:26 robbat2	Neddy probably wants to go too
Aug 16 13:04:30 quantumsummers	very well, I will check back 
Aug 16 13:04:31 robbat2	so i'll talk to sinsun
Aug 16 13:04:38 quantumsummers	NeddySeagoon: have a pleasant trip tomorrow
Aug 16 13:04:44 quantumsummers	robbat2: thanks
Aug 16 13:05:16 robbat2	sinsun, to run a booth successfully, you need a few things beyond the booth itself
Aug 16 13:05:25 robbat2	1. enough dedicated people to man the booth
Aug 16 13:05:38 robbat2	1.1 the people must know their subject matter extremely well, this usually means developers
Aug 16 13:05:50 robbat2	2. something to show off at the booth, to draw people in
Aug 16 13:05:54 NeddySeagoon	quantumsummers, thanks
Aug 16 13:06:18 sinsun	robbat2: Nod
Aug 16 13:06:31 robbat2	3. visible signage and adversiting, beyond anything provided by the expo company
Aug 16 13:06:39 robbat2	3.1 Gentoo has some banners that it ships around for this
Aug 16 13:06:48 robbat2	3.2 flyers would be needed locally as well
Aug 16 13:06:54 sinsun	robbat2: how many uhman resource we need
Aug 16 13:06:56 robbat2	3.3 Gentoo media
Aug 16 13:07:23 bonsaikitten	to staff it well you want at least 3 or 4 fulltime people
Aug 16 13:07:37 sinsun	3.3 Gentoo Media is like what?
Aug 16 13:07:43 robbat2	Gentoo CDs
Aug 16 13:08:08 sinsun	robbat2: cool! ship to Taipei or we do it ourselve?
Aug 16 13:08:29 robbat2	i've done booth staffing (for phpMyAdmin) with just two people, both of us developers of phpMyAdmin, for 2 straight days, and that's really hard
Aug 16 13:08:47 robbat2	sinsun, you'd need to arrange to get it done locally
Aug 16 13:09:00 robbat2	you can probably find cheap CD pressing in Taiwan easily
Aug 16 13:09:09 sinsun	yes
Aug 16 13:09:51 robbat2	bonsaikitten, was it you or pylon that arranged some of the german stuff?
Aug 16 13:09:54 robbat2	like LinuxTag 2005?
Aug 16 13:09:59 NeddySeagoon	I need to finish packing. I'll check back later
Aug 16 13:10:06 robbat2	i recall somebody telling me how much they spent printing flyers etc
Aug 16 13:10:12 sinsun	I'll call to Exhibition clerk to detail with charge.
Aug 16 13:10:19 bonsaikitten	robbat2: mostly pylon and dertobi123, I helped with fosdem and this year's froscon
Aug 16 13:10:26 robbat2	bonsaikitten, ah, right
Aug 16 13:10:36 robbat2	sinsun, specifically, look for discounts for not-for-profit organizations
Aug 16 13:10:52 robbat2	don't commit, just research
Aug 16 13:10:53 sinsun	roger
Aug 16 13:11:17 robbat2	how many Gentoo users in Taipei would you have available to help man the booth?
Aug 16 13:12:39 sinsun	robbat2: about 10 to 20 employed 
Aug 16 13:12:59 robbat2	we need at least 200 man-hours of people available for the booth
Aug 16 13:13:45 robbat2	that's including 2.5 hours for each of setup and teardown
Aug 16 13:13:53 robbat2	and the 41 hours of the show
Aug 16 13:14:34 sinsun	robbat2: but don't be too late. CST time now is sleeping time
Aug 16 13:16:41 robbat2	ok, so you need to talk to the clerk soon to see about a cheaper rate
Aug 16 13:16:54 robbat2	and see what there is in the way of Gentoo users to help out and be able to answer questions
Aug 16 13:17:15 robbat2	it sounds interesting, so I might come out myself as a developer if it does happen
Aug 16 13:17:17 sinsun	robbat2: copy that!
Aug 16 13:18:38 robbat2	but some other developers to answer questions would probably be needed to
Aug 16 13:18:50 robbat2	and i'd still have to figure out accommodation
Aug 16 13:20:06 robbat2	and probably try to learn Mandarin again
Aug 16 13:20:29 sinsun	ok, I'll be checking one by one.  What is nex commit?
Aug 16 13:20:39 sinsun	s/nex/next
Aug 16 13:21:21 robbat2	you talk to the clerk, and report back to the trustees as to what discount and arrangement for not-for-profit organizations there are
Aug 16 13:21:28 *	tsunam has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Aug 16 13:21:34 sinsun	When actually, When do we have commit
Aug 16 13:21:34 robbat2	we'll continue from there
Aug 16 13:22:01 robbat2	err, what do you mean by that?
Aug 16 13:22:09 sinsun	and when?
Aug 16 13:22:19 robbat2	when can the foundation commit to it? or when is the deadline to sign up?
Aug 16 13:23:27 sinsun	I mean when the gentoo-trustees has talking next time?
Aug 16 13:24:24 robbat2	the next full meeting is september 13th, but we talk on the mailing alias often
Aug 16 13:24:31 robbat2	that's why I direct you to email us there
Aug 16 13:24:42 robbat2	trustees@gentoo.org
Aug 16 13:25:04 NeddySeagoon	we are also here when we are online
Aug 16 13:25:25 sinsun	oh, good!
Aug 16 13:25:32 robbat2	given timezones, it might be better for him to mention it here AND send an email
Aug 16 13:25:54 NeddySeagoon	true.
Aug 16 13:26:07 robbat2	it's 04h25 there now
Aug 16 13:26:18 NeddySeagoon	robbat2, yep
Aug 16 13:26:50 robbat2	sinsun, so, good night to you, so you can get to sleep
Aug 16 13:27:23 sinsun	robbat2: Thank you! It'll be a good dream.
Aug 16 13:27:24 robbat2	i was up till 4am last night, but that ended up being talking to political science students about open source philosophies and the commons
Aug 16 13:27:32 *	sinsun thanks to all
Aug 16 13:29:16 robbat2	http://sellingfreesoftwareforaliving.blogspot.com/2009/06/i-was-at-computex-2009-too.html <--- suse/novell booth pictures
Aug 16 13:30:02 robbat2	"1) With our close collaboration with Intel on Moblin, we are 1 of 2 software vendors allowed to have a booth on the traditionally hardware vendor ONLY show floor."
Aug 16 13:30:11 robbat2	so we might not even be accepted
Aug 16 13:31:07 *	NeddySeagoon declares the meeting closed
Aug 16 13:31:14 NeddySeagoon	thank you everyone
