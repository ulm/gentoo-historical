<p>
I am pleased to report that in general the Gentoo Foundation is doing well. This year was my first to update the members list. To keep our members list current, members are removed if they do not vote for two consecutive elections. The list as of the recording date of 2013-05-19 is 113 members, down from 242. Comparing two results in 142 drops, 13 adds. Another first for me was initiating the <uri link="activities/trustee-election.xml">Trustee election.</uri> An excellent asset for my duties is the <uri link="activities/activity_tracker.xml"> Foundation Activity Tracker</uri> put together by <mail>rich0</mail> and maintained by the trustees. This tracker is a reminder of important dates and to document the process.

<p>
The <uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/server-specs.xml">Gentoo
  Infrastructure</uri> since Jan 2011 has had 11 new machines added and 7
retired. The Gentoo foundation would like to thank the <uri
  link="/proj/en/infrastructure/"> entire infra team</uri>. Their knowledge,
dedication, and tireless attention to detail assures us that every phase of our
infrastructure runs smooth, and rivals much larger projects.

<p>
  <b>Official Wiki</b>
</p>

<p>
562 registered users, 40k visits with 80k page views/month. Users are most interested in recent technologies such as GRUB2 and the Raspberry Pi. Users mostly come from the US, Germany, Russia, the UK, and France.
</p>

<p>
Goals are to further extending official documentation presence (the Bluetooth guide for instance already is on the Wiki). Opening the system to non-English content. Getting more Gentoo projects to use the wiki for their day-to-day- work and migrating overlays.g.o wiki's over to the Gentoo wiki.
