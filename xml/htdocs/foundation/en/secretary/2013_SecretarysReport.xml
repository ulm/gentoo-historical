<p>
I am pleased to report that in general the Gentoo Foundation is doing well. This year was my first to update the members list. To keep our members list current, members are removed if they do not vote for two consecutive elections. The list as of the recording date of 2013-05-19 is 113 members, down from 242. Comparing two results in 142 drops, 13 adds. Another first for me was initiating the <uri link="activities/trustee-election.xml">Trustee election.</uri> An excellent asset for my duties is the <uri link="activities/activity_tracker.xml"> Foundation Activity Tracker</uri> put together by <mail>rich0</mail> and maintained by the trustees. This tracker is a reminder of important dates and to document the process.

  <b>Official Wiki</b>

982 registered users, 1,232,191 visits with 120k page views/month. Goals are to
further extending official documentation, using the Translate extension,
editors can translate articles using a gettext-like interface, to keep track of
the status of the various translated strings and their English originals.
Getting more Gentoo projects to use the wiki for their day-to-day- work and
migrating overlays.g.o wiki's over to the Gentoo wiki.
