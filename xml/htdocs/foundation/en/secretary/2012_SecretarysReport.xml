I am pleased to report that in general the Gentoo Foundation is doing well. This document is an overview of some of the tasks that the foundation helps with and new developments within the community. I accepted the position of <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/BylawsAdopted.xml#doc_chap6secretary"> Secretary</uri>, to free up some of <mail>quantumsummers</mail>&#39;s time to devote to the duties as the Treasurer.

<p>
The <uri link="/proj/en/infrastructure/server-specs.xml">Gentoo
  Infrastructure</uri> since Jan 2011 has had 11 new machines added and 7
retired. The Gentoo foundation would like to thank the <uri
  link="/proj/en/infrastructure/"> entire infra team</uri>. Their knowledge,
dedication, and tireless attention to detail assures us that every phase of our
infrastructure runs smooth, and rivals much larger projects.

  <title>New Resources</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
  <b>Official Wiki</b>
</p>

<p>
562 registered users, 40k visits with 80k page views/month. Users are most interested in recent technologies such as GRUB2 and the Raspberry Pi. Users mostly come from the US, Germany, Russia, the UK, and France.
</p>

<p>
Goals are to further extending official documentation presence (the Bluetooth guide for instance already is on the Wiki). Opening the system to non-English content. Getting more Gentoo projects to use the wiki for their day-to-day- work and migrating overlays.g.o wiki's over to the Gentoo wiki.
