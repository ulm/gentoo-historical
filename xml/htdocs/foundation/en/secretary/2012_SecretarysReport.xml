  I am pleased to report that in general the Gentoo Foundation is doing well.

I accepted the position of <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/BylawsAdopted.xml#doc_chap6secretary"> Secretary</uri>, to free up some of <mail>quantumsummers</mail>&#39;s time to devote to the duties as the Treasurer. He is working closely with our CPA firm.

  <b>Official Wiki</b>
</p>

<p>
562 registered users, 40k visits with 80k page views/month. Users are most interested in recent technologies such as GRUB2 and the Raspberry Pi. Users mostly come from the US, Germany, Russia, the UK, and France.
</p>

<p>
  Goals are to further extending official documentation presence (the Bluetooth guide for instance already is on the Wiki). Opening the system to non-English content. Getting more Gentoo projects to use the wiki for their day-to-day- work and migrating overlays.g.o wiki's over to the Gentoo wiki.
