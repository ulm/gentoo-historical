Gentoo Foundation Conference Funding Request

The purpose of this form is to allow the foundation to keep track of funding
requests in an organized fashion, instead of having a collection of e-mails,
IRC conversations, etc.

This form has a specific format. All of the sections start at the left side of
the form. They have a short name and a description. Insert your responses
after the examples, one tab in.

File a new bug in the Infrastructure product and assign it to
trustees@gentoo.org. Attach the request form, and make sure all lines are
wrapped at 80 columns so it's easily viewable in a browser.

Summary: One-line summary of your request

of them must be a manager. If the foundation cannot directly purchase the
