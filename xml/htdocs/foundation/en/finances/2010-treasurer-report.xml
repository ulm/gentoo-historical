<p>
In the fiscal year 2010, for the period of July 1st through march 31st  we had a
Gross total of $24,404.44. Due to not having accounts from previous years, we
asked and google agreed to provide us with the funds from previous years in
addition to this years summer of code. I'd like to thank Google for doing that
and  in total the Google income came out to be:  $19,651.59. 
</p>

<p>
In the first quarter of the 2010 we had one hardware purchase for the foundation.
This was a Efika MX for development purposes costing $266.15. Events for the
quarter also included a donation in Ferris memory and travel expenses for
developers related to the SOC project. In the third quarter of this fiscal year,
there was a purchase of 6 atom based machines to replace some aging hardware and
reduced support from a vendor, who we continue to be appreciative of. The total
cost of building out the 6 servers came to $3,485.02, with an additional $50
dollars donated to the OSL student fund to thank them for the work they did in
installing the servers. 
</p>

<p>
In total, the expenses for this year comes out to be $6,158.63 dollars. This
includes the 6 servers which will be accounted for in depreciation of assets as
we move forward into the following years.
