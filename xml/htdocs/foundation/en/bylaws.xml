<title>Article III</title>
<section>
<title>Meetings of members</title>
<body>
<p><b>Section 3.1.  Place of Meetings.</b>  Meetings of the
members shall either be held electronically, or held at the principal office of
the foundation, or any other place (within or outside the State of New Mexico
and within or outside the United States) as designated in the notice of the
meeting.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.2.  Annual Meeting.</b> A meeting of the
members shall be held
annually at such time as the Board of Trustees may determine (which
shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not more than
thirteen (13) months after the organization of the foundation and, in
the case of all other meetings, not more than thirteen (13) months
after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting
the members shall elect a Board of Trustees and transact other proper
business.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.3.  Special Meetings.</b> Special meetings
of the members shall
be held when directed by the Chairman, President or the Board of
Trustees, or when requested in writing by not less than ten percent
(10%) of all members entitled to vote at the meeting.  The call for the
meeting shall be issued by the Secretary, unless the Chairman,
President, Board of Trustees or members requesting the meeting shall
designate another person to do so.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.4.  Notice.</b> Written notice stating
the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting,
the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not
less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting, either personally, electronically, or by first class mail, by or at
the direction of the Chairman, President, the Secretary, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote at such
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited
in the United States mail addressed to the member at his or her address as it
appears in the membership records of the foundation, with postage thereon
prepaid.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the foundation shall not be
required to give notice of a members' meeting to any member to whom
notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings
or of the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to
such member during the period between such two consecutive annual
meetings, have been mailed under the procedures outlined above and
have been returned undeliverable. Any action or meeting which shall be
taken or held without notice to such member shall have the same force
and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such member
delivers to the foundation a written notice setting forth his or her
then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such
member shall be reinstated.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.5.  Notice of Adjourned Meetings.</b> When a
meeting is
adjourned to another time or place, the foundation shall not be
required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If, however, the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment the Board of Trustees fixes a
new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given as provided in Section 3.4 above, to each
member of record on the new record date entitled to vote at such
meeting.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.6.  Waiver of Notice.</b>  Whenever notice
is required to be
given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of such
notice. Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the members need be
specified in the written waiver of notice.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.7.  Fixing Record Date.</b></p>
<p>(a) For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or
to vote at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Trustees may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Trustees, and which record date shall not be
more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If
no record date is fixed by the Board of Trustees, the record date for
determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
members shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of members of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Trustees may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
</p>
<p>(b) For purposes of determining the members entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Trustees
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Trustees, and which date shall not be more than 10 days
after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Trustees. If no record date has been fixed by
the Board of Trustees, the record date for determining members
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting,
when no prior action by the Board of Trustees is required by the
laws of the State of New Mexico, shall be the first
date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the foundation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of New Mexico, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the foundation having custody of
the books in which proceedings of meetings of members are recorded.
Delivery made to a foundation's registered office shall be by hand or
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Trustees and prior action
by the Board of Trustees is required by the law
of the State of New Mexico, the record date for determining members
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Trustees adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
</p>
<p>(c) For purposes of determining the members entitled to exercise any
rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Trustees may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
members for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Trustees adopts the resolution relating
thereto.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.8.  Record of Members Having Voting Rights.</b>
The officer or
agent having charge of the membership records of the foundation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before each meeting of
members, a complete list of the members entitled to vote at such
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the name,
address, telephone number, and electronic mail
address of each member. For a period of ten (10) days prior to such
meeting, the list shall be open to the examination of any member, for
any purpose germane to the meeting.  This list may be accessed elecronically,
or, in the case of a non-electronic meeting, it may be
accessed during ordinary business hours,
either at a place within the city where such meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not
so specified, at the place where such meeting is to be held. The list
shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the
meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any member at any time
during the meeting. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the
Trustees to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of
Trustees, such Trustees shall be ineligible for election to any
office at such meeting.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.9.  Member Quorum.</b>  Except as otherwise
required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, one-third (1/3)
of the members entitled to vote, represented in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. When a
specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class of
members (if the members are divided into classes), one third (1/3) of
such class of members, represented in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business
by that class of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the members represented at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the members, unless
the vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by the
law of the State of New Mexico or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. The Trustees shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes of the members present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of Trustees. Where a separate vote by class of members is
required, the affirmative vote of a plurality of members of such class
represented at the meeting shall be the act of such class unless the
vote of a greater number is required by the law of
the State of New Mexico, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws.
</p>
<p>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of
members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the
meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.
</p>
<p>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent admission of new members, so as to increase the number of
members required for a quorum above the number of members present in
person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall
not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.10. Voting.</b> Each member
(except emeritus members) shall be
entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting
of the members, except as may otherwise be provided in the law
of the State of New Mexico.
</p>
<p>A member may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by
the member or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.11. Proxies.</b> Every member entitled to
vote at a meeting of
members or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or a member's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact, may authorize another person or persons to act for
him/her by proxy.
</p>
<p>Every proxy must be signed by the member or his or her
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from
its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. All proxies shall be
revocable.
</p>
<p><b>Section 3.12. Action by Members Without a Meeting.</b>
Any action
required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of members of the foundation, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent setting
forth the action so taken shall be signed by members having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that no written
consent shall be effective unless such consent (i) bears the date of
signature by each member signing such consent and (ii) is delivered to
the foundation within sixty (60) days of the date on which the
earliest consent was delivered to the foundation.  Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those members who have not
consented in writing.

action of the members.
</p>
<p>Upon the effective date of conversion of the membership of any member
to emeritus status, the membership, including all related voting
rights, of such member shall be suspended, except that such emeritus
member shall be entitled to attend (but not vote) at meetings of the
members, and the officers of the foundation shall attempt, in good
faith, to continue to deliver notices of meetings of the members of

emeritus member membership shall be reinstated as a full member of the
foundation, and shall be entitled to exercise all rights as a member
of the foundation, including all related voting rights.
</p>
<p><b>Section 4.8. Voluntary Withdrawal from Membership.</b>
Members (including
emeritus members) may withdraw from membership in the foundation at
any time upon ten (10) days' written, signed notice delivered to an

<title>Trustees</title>
<body>
<p><b>Section 5.1.  Powers.</b> The business and affairs
of the foundation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees,
the "Trustees",
which may exercise all such powers of the foundation and do all such
lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these Bylaws specifically reserved to the members.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.2.  Qualification.</b> Trustees need not

the foundation.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.3.  Compensation.</b> The Board of Trustees

initially have thirteen (13)
Trustees. Thereafter, the number of Trustees shall be fixed by the

in the Certificate
of Incorporation or elected by the incorporator(s) at the organization

A director may
resign at any time upon written request to the foundation.
Furthermore, any director or the entire Board of Trustees may be

provided in the General Foundation Law of the State of New Mexico.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.7.  Vacancies.</b> Any vacancy occurring
in the Board of
Trustees, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in
the authorized number of Trustees, may be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the remaining Trustees though less than a
quorum of the Board of Trustees or by a sole remaining director. If
there is more than one class of members, vacancies of trusteeships
elected by such class may be filled by a majority of the Trustees
elected by such class or by a sole remaining director. A director
elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office only until the next
election of Trustees by the members.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.8.  Quorum and Voting.</b> A majority of
the number of
Trustees fixed in accordance with these Bylaws shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the
Trustees present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be
the act of the Board of Trustees.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.9.  Executive and Other Committees.</b>
The Board of Trustees,
by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board of Trustees,
may designate an Executive Committee from among its members and such
other committees consisting of at least one director as determined by
the Board of Trustees from time to time. Each committee, to the
extent provided in such authorizing resolution, shall have and may
exercise all the power and authority of the Board of Trustees in the
management of the business and affairs of the foundation, as limited
by the laws of the State of New Mexico.
</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees, by resolution adopted in accordance with this
section, may designate one or more Trustees as alternate members of
any such committee, who may act in the place and stead of any absent
or disqualified member or members at any meeting of such committee.
In the absence or disqualification of any member of any such committee
or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of
Trustees to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.10. Place of Meetings.</b> Regular and
special meetings of the
Board of Trustees may be held in person or electronically,
within or outside the State of New Mexico
and within or outside the United States.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.11. Time, Notice and Call of Meetings.</b>
Regular meetings of
the Board of Trustees shall be held immediately following the annual
meeting of members each year and at such times thereafter as the Board
of Trustees may fix. No notice of regular Trustees' meetings shall
be required.
</p>
<p>Special meetings of the Board of Trustees shall be held at such
times as called by the Chairman of the Board, the President of the
foundation, or any two (2) Trustees. Written notice of the time and
place of special meetings of the Board of Trustees shall be given to
each director by either personal delivery, telegram, cablegram, or telefax at
least two (2) days before the meeting, or by notice mailed (electronically or
otherwise) to each director at least five (5) days before the meeting.
</p>
<p>Notice of a meeting of the Board of Trustees need not be given to
any director who signs a waiver of notice, either before or after the
meeting. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting and waiver of any and all objections
to the place of the meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner in
which it has been called or conveyed, except when a director states,
at the beginning of the meeting, any objection to the transaction of
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
</p>
<p>Members of the Board of Trustees may participate in a meeting of
such Board or of any committee designated by such Board by conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same
time.  Participating by such means shall constitute presence in person
at a meeting.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.12. Action Without a Meeting.</b> Any action
required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Trustees or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all the members of
the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in
writing, and such writing is filed with the minutes of the proceedings
of the board or committee. Such consent shall have the same effect as
a unanimous vote.
</p>
<p><b>Section 5.13. Director Conflicts of Interest.</b>
No contract or other
transaction between the foundation and one or more of its Trustees
or between the foundation and any other foundation, partnership,
association or other organization in which one or more of the
Trustees of the foundation are Trustees or officers or are
financially interested, shall be void or voidable solely because of
such relationship or interest or solely because such director or
Trustees are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board of
Trustees or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or
ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because his or her or
their votes are counted for such purpose, if:
</p>
<p>A. The material facts as to the director's relationship or interest
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the Board of Trustees or committee, and the Board of Trustees or
committee in good faith authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract
or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested Trustees, even though the disinterested Trustees be
less than a quorum; or
</p>
<p>B. The material facts as to their relationship or interest and as to
the contract or transaction are disclosed or known to the members
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of such members; or
</p>
<p>C. The contract or transaction is fair as to the foundation at the
time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Trustees,
a committee of the Board of Trustees or the members.
</p>
<p>Common or interested Trustees may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Trustees or a
committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies such contract
or transaction.

appointed, shall render assistance to the Treasurer in all of the
responsibilities described above.
</p>
<p><b>Section 6.3. Project Management Committees.</b>
In addition to the
officers of the foundation, the Board of Trustees may, by
resolution, establish one or more Project Management Committees
consisting of at least one officer of the foundation, who shall be
designated chairman of such committee, and may include one or more
other members of the foundation. Unless elected or appointed as an
officer in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.4 of these Bylaws, a
member of a Project Management Committee shall not be deemed an
officer of the foundation.
</p>
<p>Each Project Management Committee shall be responsible for the active
management of one or more projects identified by resolution of the
Board of Trustees which may include, without limitation, the creation
or maintenance of "open-source" software for distribution to the
public at no charge. Subject to the direction of the Board of
Trustees, the chairman of each Project Management Committee shall be
primarily responsible for project(s) managed by such committee, and he
or she shall establish rules and procedures for the day to day
management of project(s) for which the committee is responsible.
Note, however, that no committee of the Gentoo Foundation may govern 
the development of Gentoo (the operating system).
</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees of the foundation may, by resolution,
terminate a Project Management Committee at any time.
</p>
<p><b>Section 6.4.  Election and Term.</b>  The officers
of the foundation and
the members of each existing Project Management Committee shall be
appointed by the Board of Trustees or appointed by an officer
empowered by the Board to make such appointment. Such appointment by
the Board of Trustees may be made at any regular or special meeting
of the Board. Each officer shall hold office and each member of a
Project Management Committee shall serve on such committee for a
period of one year or until his or her successor is elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
</p>
<p><b>Section 6.5.  Removal of Officers.</b> Any officer
or agent and any
member of a Project Management Committee elected or appointed by the
Board of Trustees may be removed by the Board whenever, in its
judgment, the best interests of the foundation will be served
thereby.
</p>
<p><b>Section 6.6.  Vacancies.</b> Any vacancy, however
occurring, in any
office or any Project Management Committee may be filled by the Board
of Trustees.
</p>
<p><b>Section 6.7.  Compensation.</b> The compensation, if
any, of all officers
of the foundation and of all members of each existing Project
Management Committee shall be fixed by the Board of Trustees and may
be changed from time to time by a majority vote of the Board of
Trustees. The fact that an officer is also a director shall not
preclude such person from receiving compensation as either a director
or officer, nor shall it affect the validity of any resolution by the
Board of Trustees fixing such compensation.  The President shall have
authority to fix the salaries, if any, of all employees of the
foundation, other than officers elected or appointed by the Board of
Trustees and members of Project Management Committees.

<title>Indemnification of officers and Trustees</title>
<body>
<p><b>Section 12.1. Right to Indemnification.</b>  Each person
who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the foundation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer or member of the foundation, or is or was
serving at the request of the foundation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another foundation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement to the fullest extent now or hereafter
permitted by applicable law as long as such person acted in good faith
and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not
be opposed to the best interests of the foundation; provided,
however, that the foundation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Trustees.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.</b>
Expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any person who is or was an
officer, director or member of the foundation, or who is or was
serving at the request of the foundation as an officer or director of
another foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the
foundation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or
she is not entitled under applicable law to be indemnified by the
foundation.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.</b>
If a claim under this
Article is not paid in full by the foundation within ninety (90) days
after a written claim has been received by the foundation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the foundation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole
or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
foundation unless such action is based on the claimant having
committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct which make indemnification permissible
under the General Foundation Law of the State of New Mexico, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the foundation. Neither
the failure of the foundation (including its Board of Trustees,
independent legal counsel, or its members) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
law of the State of New Mexico, nor an actual
determination by the foundation (including its Board of Trustees,
independent legal counsel, or its members) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.4. Contract Rights.</b> The provisions
of this Article shall
be a contract between the foundation and each director, officer or
member to which this Article applies.  No repeal or modification of
these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any right or obligation
with respect to any state of facts existing prior to the time of such
repeal or modification.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.5. Rights Non-exclusive.</b> The
indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members or disinterested
Trustees or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.6. Insurance.</b> The foundation may
purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
member, employee or agent of the foundation, or is or was serving at
the request of the foundation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the foundation would have the
power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this Article or of applicable law.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.7. Definitions.</b> For purposes of
this Article, references
to "the foundation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
foundation, any constituent foundation (including any constituent of
a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
to indemnify its Trustees, officers, and employees or agents, so that
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
such constituent foundation, or is or was serving at the request of
such constituent foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article with
respect to the resulting or surviving foundation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent foundation if its separate
existence had continued, and references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include
any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
foundation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the foundation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants
and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have
acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
foundation" as referred to in this Article.
</p>
<p><b>Section 12.8. Continued Coverage.</b> The indemnification
and advancement
of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this Article shall,
unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or member and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person.

executions may be transmitted to the foundation and/or the other
Trustees and/or members by facsimile and such facsimile execution

executions or a combination, shall be construed together and shall
