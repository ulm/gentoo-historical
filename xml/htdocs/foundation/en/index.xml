<title>About this document</title>
<body>

<p>
The purpose of this document is to elaborate on the Gentoo Foundation goals,
structure and tasks. It does not describe the goals of the Gentoo project and
does not contain any policies about the Gentoo development process.
</p>

<title>Why a Gentoo Foundation?</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo distribution is maturing rapidly. Since its birth in 1999 the
distribution has evolved to one of the top Linux distributions available today.
The incorporated technologies including Portage, the software management
system, are frequently seen as major software breakthroughs. 
</p>

<p>
In order to sustain the current quality and development swiftness the Gentoo
project needs a framework for intellectual property protection and financial 
contributions while limiting the contributors legal exposure. The Gentoo
Foundation will embody this framework without intervening in the Gentoo 
development. This latter aspect should be seen as a clear separation between 
coordinating the Gentoo development and protecting Gentoo's assets. Both are 
distinct concepts requiring different skills and working methods.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo Foundation decouples necessary bureaucracy from development,
providing faster and higher quality results as the developer can now focus his
attention completely at the community and his responsibilities (being software,
documentation, infrastructure or others).
</p>

<p>
The bureaucracy we mention includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    financial caretaking: accepting donations, managing financial assets and
    investing in required resources or entities that benefit the Gentoo
    development
  </li>
  <li>
    juridical protection: backing up the licenses Gentoo uses, maintaining the
    copyrights on Gentoo's software, documentation and other assets and 
    protecting Gentoo's intellectual property
  </li>
  <li>
    Gentoo caretaking: protecting the community by requiring total adherence to
    the <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/contract.xml">Gentoo Social
    Contract</uri>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words, the Gentoo Foundation will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    protect the use of the Gentoo trademark and logo
  </li>
  <li>
    protect the developed code, documentation, artwork and other material
    through copyright and licenses
  </li>
  <li>
    sponsor Gentoo-related conferences and technical development resources
  </li>
  <li>
    oversee development so it adheres to the social contract
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Principles of the Gentoo Foundation</title>
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo Foundation keeps four pillars in mind:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gentoo provides choices</li>
  <li>Gentoo is open</li>
  <li>Gentoo lives for the community, by the community</li>
  <li>Gentoo is independent</li>
</ol>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Gentoo provides choices</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo is a metadistribution, providing choices to its users. This important
idea forms the basis of Gentoo's development: not a single feature will be
dismissed in favor of a different one when both can be maintained. Skills
learned today will still be relevant in the future.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Gentoo is open</title>
<body>

<p>
Every aspect of Gentoo is and remains open. Gentoo does not benefit from hiding
any of its development processes (wether it is sourcecode or documentation,
decisions or discussions, coordination or management).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Gentoo lives for the community, by the community</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo strives to please its users. The Gentoo community is Gentoo's goal of
life. Without community there is no Gentoo. To help Gentoo's development, the
community provides a continuous stream of feedback and contributes to the
various aspects of the Gentoo distribution. This cooperative model will remain
valid for Gentoo's entire lifespan.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Gentoo is independent</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo will never be reigned by a company nor be dictated by an organisation.
</p>

<title>Tasks of the Gentoo Foundation</title>
<section>
<title>Intellectual Property Protection</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo Foundation is the legal owner of the Gentoo trademark and logo. To
protect Gentoo it will oversee the use of the Gentoo name and logo and take
appropriate action when the Gentoo Foundation feels that the name or logo is
wrongfully used.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Support the Gentoo Development</title>
<body>

<p>
The Gentoo Foundation has revenues gathered from donations, sold Gentoo items
and other sources. This financial income will be used to support the Gentoo
development in any way possible, as decided by the trustees.
</p>

<p>
The primary use of the funds are to support Gentoo's infrastructure as it is the
backbone of the project. 
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Oversee adherence to the Social Contract</title>
<body>

<p>
To keep the spirit of Openness and Freedom alive within Gentoo, the Gentoo
Foundation continues to keep an active eye on the Gentoo development to make
sure it adheres to the <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/contract.xml">Gentoo Social Contract</uri>.

<title>Election Process</title>
<body>

<p>
The mathematical election method the Gentoo Foundation uses is called the <uri
link="http://electionmethods.org/CondorcetEx.htm">Condorcet Voting</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Each Gentoo Developer that has been an active developer for at least one year
at the moment the voting period starts is able to rank all candidates in the
preferred order of election. Multiple entries for the same position are allowed.
</p>

<p>
The Condorcet Voting then takes two candidates and counts how many times
candidate A was ranked higher than candidate B and vice versa. Then, based on
this numbers, it looks for the candidate that is not beaten by any other
candidate and ranks him on top. It then removes this candidate from the list and
starts the process again to find the subsequent "winners".
</p>

<p>
When no candidate in a set of candidates is unbeaten, the least decisive defeat 
is dropped, again and again, until either one candidate remains (who is then
marked as a "winner") or a true tie exists. In case of the Gentoo Foundation,
only when a true tie exists for the final (13th) position the President of the
board has the final saying (otherwise both candidates are welcomed as
"winners").
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Trustee Responsibilities</title>
<body>

<p>
As a group, the Trustees each have an equal vote to decide upon issues outlined in the tasks above.  A majority vote (7 of 13) is required for all decisions.  The trustees must uphold the principles of the Gentoo Foundation, it's bylaws, and help to maintain a good reputation for the Foundation.
</p>

<p>
Currently there are no specific responsibilities or positions in the Board (such as a Treasurer), but this may change in the future as the Board of Trustees 
lays the groundwork for the future of the Foundation.
