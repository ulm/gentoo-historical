Gentoo Foundation
Funding Request

The purpose of this form is to allow the foundation to keep track of funding
requests in an organized fashion, instead of having a collection of e-mails, IRC
conversations, etc.

This form has a specific format. All of the sections start at the left side of
the form. They have a short name and a description. Insert your responses after
the examples, one tab in. A sample form is available at <INSERT LOCATION>.

File a new bug in the Infrastructure product and assign it to
trustees@gentoo.org. Attach the request form, and make sure all lines are
wrapped at 80 columns so it's easily viewable in a browser.

Summary: One-line summary of your request

	New computer and new socks for Donnie

Requesters: Names and nicks of people involved in this request. At least one
of them must be a manager. If the foundation cannot directly purchase the
request, the first requester will receive access to funding.

	Donnie Berkholz (spyderous), Grant Goodyear (g2boojum)

Deadline (optional): Day Month Year. This may not be applicable in all cases.

	11 June 2005

Priority: Urgent, High, Medium or Low (select one)

	High

Amount requested: This must be in U.S. dollars.

	$3730 USD

Funding type and duration: One-time or ongoing budget. If ongoing budget, put
the budget's ending date as well as the reason it must be ongoing.

	One-time

Funding disbursement: Will the foundation directly purchase the equipment,
or must the funds be given to a requester? If they must be given to a requester,
state why.

	Requester

Problem: Describe the problem this funding would solve. If the problem is
actually a set of mostly unrelated problems, please file a separate request
for each one.

	Donnie's computer is broken. He also has smelly feet.

Solution: Describe the solution for the problem. Also justify why this solution
is the best solution and which alternative solutions have been considered.

Justification: Provide any available information to show that your
requested funding will be sufficient for your problem.

	Last year we only requested $15 to cover Donnie's smelly feet, but it
	wasn't enough. We spent it after just six months, so we've doubled the
	request.
