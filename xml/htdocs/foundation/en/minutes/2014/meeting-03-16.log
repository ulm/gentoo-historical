Mar 16 15:12:51 <quantumsummers|c>	SwifT: [unrelated] we should include the actual reg. data for our trademarks on the page

Mar 16 15:16:14 <quantumsummers|c>	dabbott: ok, I see
Mar 16 15:16:27 <dabbott>	for the 2013 report I will have to find it, quantumsummers|c may be able to do it for me and also the 2014
Mar 16 15:17:02 <dabbott>	I just did the old ones converted it from gentoo.org
Mar 16 15:17:23 <NeddySeagoon>	dabbott, it would be good to have current up to date info in the GMN
Mar 16 15:17:34 <quantumsummers|c>	yeah, I need to take a look at whats there, and learn how to edit our wiki
Mar 16 15:18:02 <quantumsummers|c>	page wiki/Foundation:Gentoo_Foundation_Finances_2010 is missing info for Q4
Mar 16 15:18:31 <dabbott>	yea thats when Josh left
Mar 16 15:18:53 <quantumsummers|c>	I'll take a look
Mar 16 15:18:53 <NeddySeagoon>	quantumsummers anything on    Financial | Legal Status    Certified Public Accountant    501(c)(3) registration status  ?
Mar 16 15:18:56 <dabbott>	I think it was missing on the main site also
Mar 16 15:19:01 <quantumsummers|c>	NeddySeagoon: nothing to report
Mar 16 15:19:07 <quantumsummers|c>	well one thing
Mar 16 15:19:30 <quantumsummers|c>	I received a huge set of documents from our Trademark people, with our entire history with them
Mar 16 15:19:44 <quantumsummers|c>	all the official TM docs, etc
Mar 16 15:20:02 <quantumsummers|c>	I guess I'll stick that in my safe deposit box
Mar 16 15:20:34 <quantumsummers|c>	thats it
Mar 16 15:20:56 <NeddySeagoon>	Do we need to have them scanned and circulated?
Mar 16 15:21:25 <SwifT>	i'd like to look at them if you don't mind
Mar 16 15:21:32 <quantumsummers|c>	it came with a CD.
Mar 16 15:21:35 <NeddySeagoon>	Should they be stored by Wayne Chew ... our man in NM?
Mar 16 15:21:49 <quantumsummers|c>	there are several hundred pages here
Mar 16 15:22:20 <NeddySeagoon>	Can you host the CD.  I'm curious too?
Mar 16 15:22:33 <quantumsummers|c>	I would say no to W. Chew, I can keep them at my bank
Mar 16 15:22:44 <quantumsummers|c>	I'll image the cd, we can pass that around
Mar 16 15:22:53 <quantumsummers|c>	probably best to encrypt it
Mar 16 15:23:26 <NeddySeagoon>	paper records are a PITA.  Is the trademark stuff secret ?
Mar 16 15:24:40 <quantumsummers|c>	only the client/attorney correspondence
Mar 16 15:24:48 <NeddySeagoon>	quantumsummers|c, I'm thinking of the 'bus factor' and getting the docs out of your bank
Mar 16 15:25:55 <quantumsummers|c>	I have all that taken care of in the case of my death, documentation, estate manger, etc. 
Mar 16 15:26:02 <quantumsummers|c>	but whatever you guys want to do
Mar 16 15:26:16 <quantumsummers|c>	Chew may not be the best choice of keepers
Mar 16 15:26:32 <quantumsummers|c>	hard to get ahold of
Mar 16 15:27:10 <NeddySeagoon>	Wayne will want a storage fee.  If everything is taken care of, as long as the papers are safe.  I'w ok
Mar 16 15:28:21 <dabbott>	quantumsummers|c: Just make some copies and send it aroude for backup / review sounds good to me 
Mar 16 15:28:29 <quantumsummers|c>	actually I would really prefer to somehow permanently engage Fenwick and West to manage this, and send their stuff back to them
Mar 16 15:28:59 <NeddySeagoon>	quantumsummers|c, ask them for a quote
Mar 16 15:28:59 <quantumsummers|c>	I will send the disk image tonight
Mar 16 15:29:03 <quantumsummers|c>	NeddySeagoon: I will
Mar 16 15:29:28 <quantumsummers|c>	couldnt be that bad, we only need to do things every 5 or 10 years
Mar 16 15:30:03 <NeddySeagoon>	yep ... if we don't ask we will never know.
Mar 16 15:30:37 <NeddySeagoon>	What do you mean "send the disk image" ?
Mar 16 15:30:43 <quantumsummers|c>	I'll email on Monday
Mar 16 15:30:57 <quantumsummers|c>	NeddySeagoon: dunno, prob email a link to DL from my servers
Mar 16 15:31:04 <quantumsummers|c>	depends on how large it is
Mar 16 15:31:10 <NeddySeagoon>	That works for me
Mar 16 15:31:19 <quantumsummers|c>	or just gpg->email
Mar 16 15:31:30 <quantumsummers|c>	either way, it will be encrypted
Mar 16 15:31:35 <NeddySeagoon>	heh ... ok
Mar 16 15:31:54 <quantumsummers|c>	hate to do this, but I need to bug outta here to deal with kids.
