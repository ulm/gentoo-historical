Jan 19 14:02:12 <NeddySeagoon>	quantumsummers|c, Betelgeuse ?
Jan 19 14:03:06 <NeddySeagoon>	Lets start anyway. 3 is a quorum 
Jan 19 14:03:42 <NeddySeagoon>	 Treasurer Report ... I guess that needs quantumsummers|c ?
Jan 19 14:04:03 <dabbott>	yes it does
Jan 19 14:04:04 <Betelgeuse>	NeddySeagoon: here
Jan 19 14:04:14 <quantumsummers|c>	trying to get the boy down for a nap
Jan 19 14:04:24 <NeddySeagoon>	Hi Betelgeuse quantumsummers|c 
Jan 19 14:04:28 <quantumsummers|c>	back shortly, hopefully.
Jan 19 14:04:34 <quantumsummers|c>	hey NeddySeagoon :-)
Jan 19 14:04:41 <quantumsummers|c>	this Dad thing is a pain in the arse
Jan 19 14:04:45 <quantumsummers|c>	sometimes
Jan 19 14:05:00 *	quantumsummers|c tries to get Linc to sleep.
Jan 19 14:05:13 <SwifT>	=)
Jan 19 14:05:22 <NeddySeagoon>	Foundation Activity Tracker ... nothing listed as pending - unless anyone knows differently
Jan 19 14:06:14 <NeddySeagoon>	quantumsummers|c, it gets worse as they get older ... have you had to ask him for your car keys yet ?
Jan 19 14:08:20 <NeddySeagoon>	dabbott, do you need to say a few words about Quarterly Financial Statements on the Wiki ?
Jan 19 14:08:45 <dabbott>	its just a reminder, waiting for some numbers to continue
Jan 19 14:09:20 <NeddySeagoon>	now we are back to quantumsummers
Jan 19 14:10:03 <NeddySeagoon>	dabbott, you cold post the history while you wait for current numbers.
Jan 19 14:10:13 <NeddySeagoon>	could*
Jan 19 14:10:40 <dabbott>	sure
Jan 19 14:10:51 <dabbott>	its all old
Jan 19 14:11:45 <NeddySeagoon>	dabbott, well, if we are going to migrate it all, you can start any time.  The 2014 test page looks good
Jan 19 14:12:03 <dabbott>	ok will do :)
Jan 19 14:12:48 <dabbott>	here is the latest I have http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/finances/2012-treasurer-report.xml
Jan 19 14:13:13 <dabbott>	how far back do you want to go http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/finances/index.xml
Jan 19 14:14:42 <dabbott>	missing from  June 30 2012 untill present
Jan 19 14:14:55 <NeddySeagoon>	dabbott, back to 2004, when the foundation was founded.  quantumsummers had the early data .. or most of it on the olb web page
Jan 19 14:14:59 <dabbott>	afaik
Jan 19 14:15:34 <NeddySeagoon>	SwifT, is your wee one asleep ?  is so, its your turn ... Gentoo Trademark License Agreement
Jan 19 14:15:42 <SwifT>	ok
Jan 19 14:15:45 <SwifT>	yes, she's silent
Jan 19 14:16:01 <SwifT>	okay; i've updated the draft licence agreement according to the feedback received
Jan 19 14:16:08 <NeddySeagoon>	Heh, thats not the same thing  :)
Jan 19 14:16:22 <SwifT>	it now also includes references to gentoo e.V. and i've sent it to alex
Jan 19 14:16:38 <SwifT>	I think it would be nice if the agreement would match both gentoo foundation and gentoo e.V.
Jan 19 14:17:05 <SwifT>	but I haven't pushed him to discuss it with the e.V. members yet - i'll do so (just forgot that)
Jan 19 14:17:08 <Betelgeuse>	yes that's a good coal
Jan 19 14:17:10 <Betelgeuse>	goal
Jan 19 14:17:24 <SwifT>	we're not in a hurry, but I don't want the effort to go to sleep either
Jan 19 14:17:27 <Betelgeuse>	SwifT: One thing I noticed when reading it from their perspetive that the lingo is geared towards the US/UK
Jan 19 14:17:30 <SwifT>	unlike my offspring :p
Jan 19 14:17:38 <Betelgeuse>	SwifT: Germany does not use for example common law
Jan 19 14:17:56 <NeddySeagoon>	We did try to contact the e.V. when ferris was a trustee but never got a response at that time.  We do need to work with them
Jan 19 14:18:05 <Betelgeuse>	Ideally both a US and European lawyer would look it over
Jan 19 14:18:14 <Betelgeuse>	NeddySeagoon: Also we should really look at cross licensing
Jan 19 14:18:29 <Betelgeuse>	NeddySeagoon: We have assets in Europe so we should ideally have something in palce with e.V.
Jan 19 14:19:32 <NeddySeagoon>	Betelgeuse, the e.V. predates the foundation but the registration of the mank by the e.V. mas carried out with drobbins encouragement
Jan 19 14:19:55 <SwifT>	well, I'll try to get e.V. members feedback on it and see how far we can get. Having lawyers from both US and EU review it would be nice, but perhaps mostly after consensus ;)
Jan 19 14:20:24 <NeddySeagoon>	Maybe I should say Gentoo Technologies Inc encouragement
Jan 19 14:20:55 <NeddySeagoon>	SwifT, yes, thats a worth while goal
Jan 19 14:21:43 <Betelgeuse>	NeddySeagoon: I am not sure how far that would help if we got into a dispute
Jan 19 14:22:23 <NeddySeagoon>	Betelgeuse, probably not at all.
Jan 19 14:22:55 <Betelgeuse>	NeddySeagoon: exactly
Jan 19 14:23:08 <SwifT>	other than that, no news on the Gentoo trademar license agreement
Jan 19 14:23:55 <NeddySeagoon>	The foundation inherited from Gentoo Technologies Inc and the e.V. was encouraged by Gentoo Technologies Inc.  We need to work together
Jan 19 14:24:52 <NeddySeagoon>	quantumsummers|c, your turn ... mafbe give Linc a wee dram to make him sleepy :)
Jan 19 14:25:25 <SwifT>	let him watch the output of "emerge -e @world"
Jan 19 14:25:25 <SwifT>	:p
Jan 19 14:25:33 <NeddySeagoon>	hehe
Jan 19 14:28:42 <SwifT>	I think Linc is making quantumsummers|c sleepy :p
Jan 19 14:29:10 <NeddySeagoon>	Lets move on to bugs while we wait for Linc  :)
Jan 19 14:29:50 <NeddySeagoon>	bug 494524
Jan 19 14:29:52 <willikins>	NeddySeagoon: https://bugs.gentoo.org/494524 "games-emulation/m64py: Don't distribute files without the required license"; Gentoo Linux, Games; UNCO; franzschrober:games
Jan 19 14:30:43 <NeddySeagoon>	Nothing to add at the moment
Jan 19 14:31:24 <NeddySeagoon>	bug 492386
Jan 19 14:31:25 <willikins>	NeddySeagoon: https://bugs.gentoo.org/492386 "Fund the setup of an opensource chocolate to use at conventions"; Gentoo Foundation, Proposals; CONF; dabbott:trustees
Jan 19 14:31:50 <NeddySeagoon>	I recall that we voted not to fund chocolate
Jan 19 14:32:03 <SwifT>	indeed
Jan 19 14:32:07 <dabbott>	we can close that one
Jan 19 14:32:26 <NeddySeagoon>	OK
Jan 19 14:34:08 <NeddySeagoon>	done
Jan 19 14:34:18 <dabbott>	thanks NeddySeagoon 
Jan 19 14:35:05 <Betelgeuse>	there's the follow up to the thread about just allowing trademark usage
Jan 19 14:35:36 <SwifT>	there's a bug on that?
Jan 19 14:35:45 <Betelgeuse>	SwifT: nope
Jan 19 14:35:55 <Betelgeuse>	SwifT: at least I have only seen in emails
Jan 19 14:36:20 <SwifT>	i can't remember discussions on just allowing trademark usage :(
Jan 19 14:36:42 <SwifT>	you can't just allow the usage, because then you lose the trademark afaik
Jan 19 14:37:11 <NeddySeagoon>	did bug 473214 ever get fixed ?
Jan 19 14:37:12 <willikins>	NeddySeagoon: https://bugs.gentoo.org/473214 "Non-paypal contribution method"; Gentoo Foundation, Proposals; CONF; rich0:trustees
Jan 19 14:37:40 <NeddySeagoon>	We have another pending request
Jan 19 14:38:06 <Betelgeuse>	SwifT: for this specific case of course
Jan 19 14:38:28 <Betelgeuse>	SwifT: Though I think I instructed to make a specific request it was left somewhat in the air
Jan 19 14:38:30 <SwifT>	Betelgeuse: ah ok, sorry - misinterpretet the chat then
Jan 19 14:39:51 <NeddySeagoon>	I think thats all the bugs for now .. do we need to discuss any others ?
Jan 19 14:40:24 <SwifT>	i'm still hoping to write up a policy statement draft to look at (as per bug #351045)
Jan 19 14:40:25 <willikins>	SwifT: https://bugs.gentoo.org/351045 "www site needs a privacy policy"; Website www.gentoo.org, Social Contract; CONF; robbat2:infra-bugs

Jan 19 14:42:37 <dabbott>	fine here

Jan 19 14:43:24 <Betelgeuse>	Will be quite late
Jan 19 14:43:27 <Betelgeuse>	in the night
Jan 19 14:43:28 <NeddySeagoon>	well its far enough away so I can make it work
Jan 19 14:43:54 <Betelgeuse>	I think I can make it work though
Jan 19 14:44:03 <NeddySeagoon>	Betelgeuse, do you want to propose a new date/time ?
Jan 19 14:44:03 <Betelgeuse>	but how are people for starting earlier?
Jan 19 14:44:21 <dabbott>	fine here
Jan 19 14:44:36 <SwifT>	difficult to say - might be okay here as well, but depends on family business that I don't know yet
Jan 19 14:45:20 <Betelgeuse>	Actually there's FIN-CAN 17UTC
Jan 19 14:45:21 <dabbott>	we can try 17:00 UTC if that helps anyone
Jan 19 14:45:32 <Betelgeuse>	let's keep it as is then
Jan 19 14:45:34 <NeddySeagoon>	I may be able to do earlier but would prefer a different date
Jan 19 14:45:57 <Betelgeuse>	would ahve to be Saturday for earlier
Jan 19 14:46:21 <Betelgeuse>	since we are at winter time it's not that bad actually
Jan 19 14:46:34 <Betelgeuse>	if anything I might be a little late due to the game
Jan 19 14:46:55 <NeddySeagoon>	if I avoid dinner at 17:00, that works
Jan 19 14:47:16 <Betelgeuse>	NeddySeagoon: I looked at the schedule and 17UTC does not work
Jan 19 14:47:28 <Betelgeuse>	though we don't have tickets for that came yet
