Aug 17 15:09:40 *	quantumsummers calls the meeting to begin
Aug 17 15:10:30 <quantumsummers>	Hear ye, hear ye, the Gentoo Foundation Inc's Annual General Meeting is now in session
Aug 17 15:10:38 <Betelgeuse>	I don't think the AGM cares about trustee quorum
Aug 17 15:10:52 <quantumsummers>	Roll Call (Alec will be joining shortly)
Aug 17 15:10:59 <dabbott>	here
Aug 17 15:11:09 <Betelgeuse>	here
Aug 17 15:11:14 <quantumsummers>	here
Aug 17 15:11:25 <quantumsummers>	and I have confirmation that antarus will join shortly
Aug 17 15:11:37 <quantumsummers>	#2: Who is logging?
Aug 17 15:11:46 Usage: ME <action>, sends the action to the current channel (actions are written in the 3rd person, like /me jumps)
Aug 17 15:11:54 <quantumsummers>	dabbott: do you mind managing logs?
Aug 17 15:11:57 *	dabbott logging
Aug 17 15:12:02 *	ChanServ gives voice to antarus
Aug 17 15:12:14 <dabbott>	hi antarus welcome :)
Aug 17 15:12:17 <quantumsummers>	hello antarus 
Aug 17 15:12:20 <quantumsummers>	thanks dabbott 
Aug 17 15:12:26 <antarus>	really need to post these to nfp ;p
Aug 17 15:12:49 <quantumsummers>	First order of business: please review the President's Report here: http://dev.gentoo.org/~neddyseagoon/PresidentsReport_2014.xml
Aug 17 15:12:56 <quantumsummers>	antarus: that suggestion is noted
Aug 17 15:12:56 <dabbott>	antarus: sounds like your first job
Aug 17 15:13:29 <quantumsummers>	antarus: it is the same every month, 3rd Sunday 1900UTC
Aug 17 15:13:45 <quantumsummers>	Motion to accept the President's Report
Aug 17 15:13:58 <dabbott>	seconded
Aug 17 15:14:04 <Betelgeuse>	I am confused
Aug 17 15:14:08 <Betelgeuse>	Are we having the AGM?
Aug 17 15:14:16 <quantumsummers>	Betelgeuse: yes
Aug 17 15:14:21 <quantumsummers>	this is the AGM
Aug 17 15:14:27 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: then we should see who Foundation members are present
Aug 17 15:14:40 <Betelgeuse>	before other business
Aug 17 15:15:00 <quantumsummers>	Betelgeuse: let's take care of the reports first
Aug 17 15:15:23 <antarus>	the end of the report is weird
Aug 17 15:15:36 <antarus>	'compared to other businesses we had a great year'
Aug 17 15:15:41 <antarus>	why would we write that
Aug 17 15:15:45 <quantumsummers>	no idea
Aug 17 15:15:53 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: In AGM it would be a quorum of members that vote
Aug 17 15:15:54 <quantumsummers>	Roy likes to think of the Foundation in business terms
Aug 17 15:16:06 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: So how can you have a motion if we don't know whether there's a quorum?
Aug 17 15:16:15 <antarus>	quantumsummers: I'm just unsure which other businesses we are comparing against ;)
Aug 17 15:16:47 <quantumsummers>	Betelgeuse: I really don't know what you mean here. I am following protocol for all the previous years that I have been on the board.
Aug 17 15:17:00 <quantumsummers>	We do not define a quorum of members,
Aug 17 15:17:30 <quantumsummers>	as far a quorum for the board, we have one.
Aug 17 15:17:30 <dabbott>	Betelgeuse: I think its because we meet on irc so not like a meeting in person
Aug 17 15:18:00 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: section 3.9 of bylaws
Aug 17 15:19:07 <Betelgeuse>	I am trying to relate this to Finnish AGM general practises but can't really follow
Aug 17 15:19:26 <Betelgeuse>	The boards have little to do in AGMs
Aug 17 15:19:57 <quantumsummers>	ah, ok I see what you are talking about
Aug 17 15:20:38 <Betelgeuse>	I would assume an AGM starts with a rollcall of members
Aug 17 15:20:54 <Betelgeuse>	and then see if we have quorum of members
Aug 17 15:21:33 <Betelgeuse>	plus we should state for the record whether section 3.2 was followed
Aug 17 15:21:48 <Betelgeuse>	sorry 3.4
Aug 17 15:23:11 <dabbott>	we talked about this before, the lines get blurred because of the fact we don't have a real meeting in person, this has confused me also
Aug 17 15:23:40 <quantumsummers>	so, typically in Gentoo AGM we simply present the reports, the board votes to accept, then we open the floor.
Aug 17 15:24:19 <quantumsummers>	perhaps we should amend the bylaws a bit to reflect the current precedent
Aug 17 15:25:07 <Betelgeuse>	dabbott: There are Finnish non profits that use IRC for their AGMs
Aug 17 15:25:17 <dabbott>	I wasn't here when the bylaws were put together, but looks to me they were taken from another source as a guide and then they tried to adopt
Aug 17 15:25:38 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: but if we had a quorum of members, wouldn't the members be the ones voting?
Aug 17 15:26:08 <antarus>	can we just take attendance and move on?
Aug 17 15:26:24 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: what you are describing is no different from a trustee meeting
Aug 17 15:26:52 <quantumsummers>	indeed, that is what is has looked like in the past
Aug 17 15:27:21 <quantumsummers>	have you, as a foundation member, ever attended an AGM?
Aug 17 15:28:06 <quantumsummers>	there are 11 +v in here besides the trustees
Aug 17 15:28:30 <quantumsummers>	our meetings are never well attended
Aug 17 15:29:24 <Betelgeuse>	quantumsummers: I am just lawyering here to follow steps
Aug 17 15:29:46 <antarus>	just take roll, why are we even arguing about this
Aug 17 15:29:49 <antarus>	it takes like 2 seconds
Aug 17 15:29:51 <dabbott>	11 in attendance and 83 members 
Aug 17 15:30:22 <quantumsummers>	Member Roll Call - all members please state that you are present
Aug 17 15:30:41 <quantumsummers>	as a member, I am present
Aug 17 15:30:48 <dabbott>	here
Aug 17 15:30:49 <Betelgeuse>	here
Aug 17 15:30:56 <antarus>	here
Aug 17 15:31:43 <quantumsummers>	waiting 30 more seconds for any stragglers
Aug 17 15:32:39 <quantumsummers>	last call for roll
Aug 17 15:32:49 <quantumsummers>	ok then.
Aug 17 15:33:02 <quantumsummers>	we do not have a member quorum
Aug 17 15:33:22 <Betelgeuse>	ok, thanks
Aug 17 15:33:26 <quantumsummers>	luckily for us, we have no special business outside of the following:
Aug 17 15:33:37 <quantumsummers>	1) welcome new board member Alec Warner (antarus)
Aug 17 15:33:59 <antarus>	yay!
Aug 17 15:34:00 <quantumsummers>	2) Review and vote on the acceptance of the reports from Roy and David
Aug 17 15:34:19 <quantumsummers>	thanks for joining the board antarus, may your tenure be fruitful 
Aug 17 15:34:37 <quantumsummers>	we all appreciate you joining
Aug 17 15:34:39 <antarus>	fruit is delicious
Aug 17 15:34:45 <dabbott>	yes thanks alec
Aug 17 15:35:05 <antarus>	as an aside, I am not doing much irc these days; so email / phone is best for getting a hold of me
Aug 17 15:35:09 <antarus>	as quantumsummers did earlier ;)
Aug 17 15:35:30 <quantumsummers>	I will also note for the record, that David Abbott has stepped down from the board, but has agreed to remain on as an officer, Secretary.
Aug 17 15:35:55 <quantumsummers>	so, many thanks to David for offering his time and expertise as Secretary
Aug 17 15:36:32 <antarus>	indeed, thanks David
Aug 17 15:36:49 <dabbott>	np
Aug 17 15:37:19 <Betelgeuse>	thanks
Aug 17 15:38:02 <quantumsummers>	I would like to bring the President's Report up for a vote now, shall I proceed?
Aug 17 15:38:28 <dabbott>	yes
Aug 17 15:38:31 <quantumsummers>	alternatively, if anyone would like Roy to make any changes prior to acceptance, we can vote via mail after the respective changes have been made
Aug 17 15:38:46 <quantumsummers>	similarly for the Secretary's Report
Aug 17 15:39:02 <quantumsummers>	we will be voting via email for the Treasurer's Report
Aug 17 15:39:22 <antarus>	I'm not sure I care enough about the closing remarks to delay it ;p
Aug 17 15:39:34 <quantumsummers>	antarus: please decide
Aug 17 15:39:39 <quantumsummers>	if you care enough :D
Aug 17 15:39:49 <quantumsummers>	since you're not sure
Aug 17 15:40:05 <antarus>	we can proceed
Aug 17 15:40:10 <quantumsummers>	very well.

Aug 17 15:43:08 <dabbott>	well im not on the board so I cannot second 
Aug 17 15:43:16 <quantumsummers>	anyone care to second this motion? Alternatively shall we table the motion with requests for edits?
