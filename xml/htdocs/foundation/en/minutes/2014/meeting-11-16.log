Nov 16 14:11:14 <NeddySeagoon>	SwifT, Gentoo Trademark License Agreement - progress update ?
Nov 16 14:11:50 <SwifT>	I'm waiting for the gentoo e.v. feedback, but that won't come before december 27th or so (the time that they get together to vote on stuff)
Nov 16 14:12:18 <SwifT>	I did get the suggestion to add in examples ot the trademark document - i'm still looking at how I can do that, either in the document or through a FAQ
Nov 16 14:12:37 <SwifT>	other than that no more news
Nov 16 14:14:11 <NeddySeagoon>	The document should be just that. Examples should be external.  We may need to get legal opinion before we adopt it, so short is good.

Nov 16 14:14:43 <Betelgeuse>	Having a US trademark attorney read the final proposal is prudent
