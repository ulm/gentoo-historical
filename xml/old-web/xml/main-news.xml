		<title>Christmas Gentoo Linux Update</title>
		<body>
		
<p><b>There's been a tremendous amount of work going into Gentoo Linux in the past few months, and
Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6 has become, well, pretty amazing.</b>  Very refined, and lots of new capabilities and
fixes have been added.  Here is an incomplete list:  New <b>2.4.16</b> kernel with ACPI, <b>XFS</b>, LVM, low
latency and preemptive kernel patches, a <b>new binutils</b> to fix Athlon and PIII-specific instruction
compilation problems -- resulting in rock-solid kernels even when configured for higher-end CPU
types, a new Portage release that allows you to <b>safely upgrade glibc even while you're in X</b> without
causing any applications to segfault or otherwise mess up, a <b>completely reworked and improved
install CD</b> that supports installation to LVM, software RAID, ext2, ext3, ReiserFS and XFS filesystems,
and much more.  Oh, our new glibc includes <b>a fix for the recent glibc "glob" security hole</b>.  And, of
course, the <b>latest NVIDIA drivers</b> and a very fast and stable platform to run them on, not to mention
around 1100 ports-based packages in total, and still counting.</p>

		<title>October Gentoo Linux Update</title>
		<body>
		<p>
		<b>We are currently putting the finishing touches on Gentoo Linux 1.0_rc6.</b>  In fact, things are looking so good that the release <i>after</i>
		1.0_rc6 will likely be 1.0 final!  Until 1.0 final, we won't be building any binary packages except build images, and will only support the "build from scratch" install method.  This makes things a lot easier for us and allows us to focus our efforts on working towards the 1.0 final release.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>On another note, I'm currently looking for new and exciting contracts/employment.</b>  If you're working on a challenging 
		Linux, Unix or Web development project and would like my help, please be sure to <uri link="/resume.html">check out my resume</uri>
		and <mail link="drobbins@gentoo.org">email me</mail> directly.  Thanks!
