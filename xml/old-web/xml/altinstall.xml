<body>

<p>If the standard boot-from-CD install method doesn't work for you
(or you just don't like it),
help is now here. This document serves to
provide a repository of alternative Gentoo Linux installation techniques 
to those who need them.
Or, if you prefer, it serves as 
a place to put your wacky installation methods. If you have an
installation method that you yourself find useful, or you have devised an
amusing way of installing gentoo, please dont hesitate to write something
up and  <mail link="lordviram@nesit.org">send it to me.</mail></p>

<title>Netboot install</title>
<section>
<title>Requirements</title>
<body>
<p>The requirements for a netboot install are a host computer than can
provide a tftp server and a computer
that can netboot itself via either bios or a floppy drive used to boot GRUB
or another network bootloader. A dhcp server might also be necessary. Of
course, you will also need the latest build ISO, which can be found at
<uri>http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/snapshots/build/</uri></p>

<title>Overview</title>
<body>

<p>In order to load images off the network, the first thing a netboot machine
must do is obtain an IP address. There are multiple ways of obtaining 
an IP address, and any
one of them will do. Personally, I prefer to use GRUB for everything, but if
your computer supports booting from a network already then grub might not
be necessary, even if it might be easier to just use GRUB's <c>ifconfig</c> command
instead of setting up a bootp or dhcp server.</p>

<p>Once your computer has obtained an IP address, the next logical step is to find
out what you are going to be booting and where it might be held. Once again,
it would be easiest to do this with GRUB commands as opposed to setting up
a bootp or dhcp server. You will also need to specify how to obtain an initrd
and tell the kernel that it will be using this as it's root filesystem.</p>

<p>With your kernel loaded and root filesystem mounted, you may proceed
with installation as normal. The build image could be loaded from a cd, or it
can be downloaded from the network via tftp.</p>

<title>Using GRUB</title>
<body>

<p>To use GRUB for network booting purposes, you must first have GRUB
compiled with support for your network card. It doesn't matter if you install
to floppy, or to the hard drive of the computer you wish to install Gentoo
on. If your install target already has GRUB with network support installed,
then you are one step ahead. GRUB can be downloaded from
<uri>ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/</uri></p>

<p>A configure example for enabling tulip support, the network card in my
box:</p>

<pre caption="Manual GRUB installation">
# <i>./configure --enable-tulip --prefix=/usr</i>
# <i>make &amp;&amp; make install</i>
</pre>

<p>If you are currently in Gentoo and wish to install GRUB using Gentoo
tools, then you need to install step by step in order to configure in support
for your network card. An example for using ebuild to install GRUB with
tulip support:</p>

<pre caption="Installing and configuring GRUB on Gentoo Linux">
# <i>ebuild /usr/portage/sys-apps/grub/grub-0.91.ebuild clean fetch unpack</i>
# <i>cd /var/tmp/portage/grub-0.91/work/grub-0.91/</i>
# <i>./configure --prefix=/usr --sbindir=/sbin --mandir=/usr/share/man \ </i>
> <i>--infodir=/usr/share/info --enable-tulip</i>
# <i>make</i>
# <i>touch /var/tmp/portage/grub-0.91/.compiled</i>
# <i>cd /usr/portage/</i>
# <i>ebuild sys-apps/grub/grub-0.91.ebuild install merge</i>
</pre>

<p>Now that we have the GRUB shell itself installed, we need to install to
a boot sector. Although you could install GRUB to the boot sector of your
install computer's hard drive, here we will assume that you are installing
GRUB on a boot floppy.  There are two ways of doing this. You can use the GRUB
shell itself, or you can use a provided script called <c>grub-install</c>. It is
preferable to use <c>grub-install</c> when installing GRUB to a floppy.</p>

<pre caption="grub-install example">
# <i>mkfs.ext2 /dev/fd0</i>
# <i>mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy/</i>
# <i>grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/floppy/ '(fd0)'</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/floppy/</i>
</pre>

<p><c>grub-install</c> does not always work... and isn't always the best way to install
GRUB. And since the GRUB shell works exactly like GRUB would when booted
via the boot sector, it might be more desirable just to use the GRUB shell. Here
is an example of how to use the GRUB shell to install GRUB to a floppy:</p>

<pre caption="Using the GRUB shell instead">
# <i>mkfs.ext2 /dev/fd0</i>
# <i>mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy/</i>
# <i>mkdir -p /mnt/floppy/boot/grub/</i>
# <i>cp -v /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/* /mnt/floppy/boot/grub/</i>
# <i>grub</i>
grub> <i>root (fd0)</i>
grub> <i>setup (fd0)</i>
grub> <i>quit</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/floppy/</i>
</pre>

<p>Now that we have a bootable GRUB floppy, we need to set up the host tftp server
(I suggest netkit's tftp server)
for loading our kernel and initrd. If you use inetd then you will need 
a line in your <path>/etc/inetd.conf</path> that looks
like this:</p>

<pre caption="/etc/inetd.conf">
tftp	dgram	udp	wait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.tftpd
</pre>

<p>To install the netkit tftp server under gentoo linux, emerge net-misc/netkit-tftp</p>

<note>There is an ebuild for xinetd... if you prefer to use this than feel free to do
so. However I do not use xinetd, and do not know how to set up tftp with it. If you
use it and such, please send me info on how to get xinetd working and I will include
them in this howto.</note>

<p>Now that we have our tftp server ready, we need a kernel and a root initrd to
put in it. You can compile a custom kernel yourself, but make sure it has all the
things necessary for running gentoo (like devfs) and for netbooting (like initrd
support). The root initrd will be the rescue.gz included in the gentoo ISO.</p>

<impo>Mounting an ISO file without burning it to cd requires loopback filesystem
support.</impo>

<pre>
# <i>mkdir /tftpboot</i>
# <i>mount -o loop /path/to/build-ix86-1.0_rc6-r14.iso /mnt/cdrom/</i>
# <i>cp /mnt/cdrom/isolinux/kernel /mnt/cdrom/isolinux/rescue.gz /tftpboot</i>
# <i>chmod 644 /tftpboot/*</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/cdrom/</i>
</pre>

<p>Boot the machine you want to install to with your incredibly usefull grub floppy.
Once booted you need to specify a way for the machine to get 
its IP address, specify where
to get a kernel and it's options, and where to get it's initrd.</p>

<pre>
grub> <i>ifconfig --address=192.168.0.10 --server=192.168.0.2</i>
grub> <i>root (nd)</i>
grub> <i>kernel /tftpboot/kernel devfs=nomount vga=normal load_ramdisk=1 </i>
      <i>prompt_ramdisk=0 ramdisk_size=18580 root=/dev/ram0 rw</i> <comment>(all on one line)</comment>
grub> <i>initrd /tftpboot/rescue.gz</i>
grub> <i>boot</i>
</pre>

<note>You can also use bootp and dhcp to configure your ip via grub. Use the bootp
and dhcp commands.</note>

<p>Now that you have your machine booted, you can install as normal. Refer to the
from source cd install howto.</p>
