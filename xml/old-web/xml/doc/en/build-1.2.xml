<abstract>These instructions step you through the process of installing Gentoo
Linux 1.2.  The Gentoo Linux installation process supports various installation
approaches, depending upon how much of the system you want to custom-build from
scratch.</abstract>

<version>1.6</version>

<chapter>
<title>About the Install</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>This new boot CD will boot from nearly any modern IDE CD-ROM drive, as well
as many SCSI CD-ROMs.  Included on the CD-ROM is Linux support for IDE
(built-in to the kernel) as well as support for all SCSI devices (available as
modules).  In addition, we provide modules for literally every kind of network
card that Linux supports, as well as tools to allow you to configure your
network and establish outbound <c>ssh</c> connections and download files.  </p>

<p>To install from the build CD, you will need to have a 486+ processor and
ideally at least 64 Megabytes of RAM.  (Gentoo linux has been successfully
built with 64MB of RAM + 64MB of swap space, but the build process is awfully
slow under those conditions.) To begin the install process, first grab one of
our CD ISO images from
<uri>http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/releases/build/</uri>.  Right now, we have
two CDs available.  Our first CD is <uri
link="http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/releases/build/1.2/gentoo-ix86-1.2.iso">gentoo-ix86-1.2.iso</uri>;
this ISO image is quite small (16Mb) and contains a minimal chrootable build image (<path>stage1-ix86-1.2.tbz2</path>) -- everything you need to build
a Gentoo Linux system from scratch (sources will be auto-downloaded from the
Internet as needed.)  Our second CD is <uri
link="http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/releases/build/1.2/gentoo-i686-1.2.iso">gentoo-i686-1.2.iso</uri>;
this ISO image is a bit bigger (100+Mb) -- it contains the same stuff as 
on our 16Mb ISO, <e>plus</e> a pre-built i686 base system (<path>stage3-i686-1.2.tbz2</path>) and semi-built i686
base system (<path>stage2-i686-1.2.tbz2</path>) in a tarball.  The two new tarballs require a Pentium Pro or
greater processor (K6 won't work).  If you have an i686+ system, they can really help speed up installation
if you're willing to not build everything from scratch.</p>

<p>Now, let's quickly review the install process.  We'll create partitions, 
create our filesystems, and extract either a stage1, stage2 or stage3 tarball.
If we are using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, we will take the appropriate steps
to get our systems to stage3.  Once our systems are at stage3, we can configure
them (tweaking config files, installing a bootloader, etc) and boot them and
have a fully-functional Gentoo Linux system.  Depending on what stage of the build
process you're starting from, here's what's required for installation:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>stage tarball</th><th>requirements for installation</th></tr>
<tr><ti>1</ti><ti>partition/filesystem setup, emerge rsync, bootstrap, emerge system, emerge linux sources, final configuration</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>2</ti><ti>partition/filesystem setup, emerge rsync, emerge system, emerge linux sources, final configuration</ti></tr>
<tr><ti>3</ti><ti>partition/filesystem setup, emerge rsync (optional), final configuration</ti></tr>
</table>

<title>Booting</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Once you've chosen the CD you want to use, go ahead and boot it. You'll be
greeted with a bunch of text and a <c>boot:</c> prompt at the bottom of the
screen.  At this prompt, hit enter, and Linux will begin to load from the
CD.</p> 

<p>Next, you'll be greeted with a small list of commands available on the boot
CD, including <c>nano</c> (a pico editor clone) and instructions for setting up
the network.  Then, you'll be prompted to select your preferred keymap,
followed by PCI autodetection.  The PCI autodetection process will automatically
load the appropriate kernel modules for many popular PCI SCSI and ethernet
devices.  After this, you can hit enter to enter the minimal boot CD Linux
environment.  You should have a root ("<c>#</c>") prompt on the current
console, and can also open new consoles by typing alt-f2, alt-f3, etc and then
hitting enter.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Load kernel modules</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>We're almost ready to begin installing Gentoo Linux, but first we need take
the necessary steps so that the kernel recognizes our network cards, and
optionally any SCSI hardware that is in our system that PCI autodetection
missed.  To view a list of all available network card modules, type <c>ls
/lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/net/*</c>.  To load a particular module,
type:</p>

<pre>
# <i>modprobe pcnet32</i>
	<comment>(replace pcnet32 with your NIC module)</comment>
</pre>

<p>Now, if you want to be able to access any SCSI hardware that wasn't detected
during the PCI autodetection process, you'll need to load the appropriate
modules from /lib/modules, again using <c>modprobe</c>:</p>

<pre>
# <i>modprobe aic7xxx</i>
# <i>modprobe sr_mod</i>
# <i>modprobe sd_mod</i>
</pre>

<p>Above, we modprobe the <c>aic7xxx</c> SCSI driver and then make sure that SCSI CD-ROM (<c>sr_mod</c>)
and disk (<c>sd_mod</c>) support is loaded.</p>
<note><c>hdparm</c> is included on the Gentoo iso.  
If any of your drives require tweaking, now
would be a good time to do so.  On reasonably modern hardware
<c>hdparm -d 1 /dev/hdx</c> should be quite safe.  You can use 
<c>hdparm -v /dev/hdx</c> to check your drive's settings,
and <c>hdparm -t /dev/hdx</c> to check your drive's performance.</note>
</body>

<chapter>
<title>Loading PCMCIA kernel modules</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>If you have a PCMCIA network card, you will need to do some additional 
trickery.</p>
<pre>
# <i>insmod pcmcia_core</i>
# <i>insmod i82365</i>
# <i>insmod ds</i>
# <i>cardmgr -f</i>
</pre>
<p>As cardmgr detects which hardware is present, your speaker should emit a
few reassuring beeps, and your PCMCIA network card should hum to life. You can
of course insert the PCMCIA card after loading cardmgr too, if that's 
preferable. (Technically, you need not run 
<i>cardmgr</i> if you know exactly which module your PCMCIA card requires. 
But if you don't, loading all PCMCIA modules and see which sticks won't work,
as all PCMCIA modules load obligingly and hang around for a PCMCIA card to 
drop by. <i>cardmgr</i> will also unload the module(s) for any card when you
remove it.)
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Configure installation networking</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>The new -r11+ boot CDs allow you to configure a working network, allowing you to use <c>ssh</c>, <c>scp</c> or <c>wget</c>
as needed before even beginning the installation process.  Even if you don't need to do these things now,
you should go ahead and set up networking now.  Once set up, Portage will be able to use your configured network
once you are inside the chroot environment (required for installing Gentoo Linux).</p>
</body>

<section>
<title>DHCP</title>
<body>
<p>
Network configuration is simple with DHCP; If your ISP is not using
DHCP, skip down to the static configuration section below.  
</p>
<pre caption="Network configuration with DHCP">
# <i>dhcpcd eth0</i> 
</pre>
<note>
Some ISPs require you to provide a hostname.  To do that,
add a <c>-h myhostname</c> flag to the dhcpcd command line above.
</note>
<p>If you receive <i>dhcpConfig</i> warnings, don't panic; the errors
are most likely cosmetic.  Skip down to Network testing below.</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Static configuration</title>
<body>
<p>
We need to setup just enough networking so that we can download
sources for the system build, as well as the required localhost interface.  Type in the following commands, replacing
$IFACE with your network interface (typically <c>eth0</c>), $IPNUM
with your IP address, $BCAST with your broadcast address, and $NMASK
with your network mask.  For the <c>route</c> command, replace 
$GTWAY with your default gateway.
</p>
<pre>
# <i>/sbin/ifconfig $IFACE $IPNUM broadcast $BCAST netmask $NMASK</i>
# <i>/sbin/route add -net default gw $GTWAY netmask 0.0.0.0 metric 1</i>
</pre>
<p>Now, it's time to create the <path>/etc/resolv.conf</path>
file so that name resolution (finding Web/FTP sites by name, rather than just by IP address) will work.</p>

<note>At the moment the only editor installed by default is <c>nano</c>, a
small and very easy-to-use visual editor.   Use <c>nano</c> with the <c>-w</c>
option to turn off automatic line-wrapping.
</note>

<p>Here's a template to follow for creating your /etc/resolv.conf file:
</p>
<pre caption="/etc/resolv.conf template">
domain mydomain.com
nameserver 10.0.0.1
nameserver 10.0.0.2
</pre>
<p>Replace <c>10.0.0.1</c> and <c>10.0.0.2</c> with the IP addresses of your
primary and secondary DNS servers respectively.</p>
</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Network testing</title>
<body>
<p>Now that your network has been configured, the <c>/sbin/ifconfig -a</c> command should show (hopefully!) 
that your network card is working
(look for <e>UP</e> and <e>RUNNING</e> in the output).
</p>
<pre caption="/sbin/ifconfig for a working network card">

<title>Networking is go!</title>

<p>Networking should now be configured and useable.  You should be able to use the included

<chapter>
<title>Set up partitions</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Now that the kernel can see our network card and disk controllers, it's time
to set up disk partitions for Gentoo Linux.</p>

<p>Here's a quick overview of the standard Gentoo Linux partition layout.
We're going to create at least three partitions: a swap partition, a root
partition (to hold the bulk of Gentoo Linux), and a special boot partition.
The boot partition is designed to hold GRUB boot loader information as well as
your Linux kernel(s).  The boot partition gives us a safe place to store
everything related to booting Linux. During normal day-to-day Gentoo Linux use,
your boot partition should remain <e>unmounted</e>.  This prevents your kernel
from being made unavailable to GRUB (due to filesystem corruption) in the event
of a system crash, preventing the chicken-and-egg problem where GRUB can't read
your kernel (since your filesystem isn't consistent) but you can't bring your
filesystem back to a consistent state (since you can't boot!)      </p>

<p>Now, on to filesystem types.  Right now, you have four filesystem options:
XFS, ext2, ext3 (journaling) and ReiserFS.  ext2 is the tried and true Linux
filesystem but doesn't have metadata journaling.  ext3 is the new version of
ext2 with both metadata journaling and ordered data writes, effectively
providing data journaling as well.  ReiserFS is a B*-tree based filesystem
that has very good small file performance, and greatly outperforms both ext2 and
ext3 when dealing with small files (files less than 4k), often by a factor of
10x-15x. ReiserFS also scales extremely well and has metadata journaling.
As of kernel 2.4.18+, ReiserFS is finally rock-solid and highly recommended.
XFS is an filesystem with metadata journaling that
is fully supported under Gentoo Linux's <path>xfs-sources</path> kernel.
</p><p>
If you're looking for the most standard filesystem, use ext2.  If you're looking
for the most rugged journalled filesystem, use ext3.  If you're looking for a
high-performance filesystem with journaling support, use ReiserFS;  both ext3 and ReiserFS are 
mature and refined.  Please be careful with XFS; this filesystem has a tendency to fry lots of data
if the system crashes or you lose power. Originally, it seemed like a promising filesystem but it
now appears that this tendency to lose data is a major achilles' heel.
Here are our basic recommended filesystem
sizes and types:</p>

  <table>
  <tr>
  	<th>Partition</th>
	<th>Size</th>
	<th>Type</th>
  	<th>example device</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<ti>boot partition, containing kernel(s) and boot information</ti>
	<ti>100 Megabytes</ti>
	<ti>ext2/3 highly recommended (easiest); if ReiserFS then mount with <c>-o notail</c></ti>
  	<ti>/dev/hda1</ti>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  	<ti>swap partition (no longer a 128 Megabyte limit)</ti>
	<ti>&gt;=2*Amount of RAM in this system is recommended but no longer (as of kernel 2.4.10) required</ti>
	<ti>Linux swap</ti>
  	<ti>/dev/hda2</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<ti>root partition, containing main filesystem (/usr, /home, etc)</ti>
	<ti>&gt;=1.5 Gigabytes</ti>
	<ti>ReiserFS, ext3 recommended; ext2 ok</ti>
  	<ti>/dev/hda3</ti>
  </tr>
 </table>

<note>At this point, create your partitions using fdisk.  Note that your partitions
should be of type 82 if swap and 83 for regular filesystems (whether ReiserFS <e>or</e> ext2/3).
</note>

<p>Once you've created your partitions using <c>fdisk</c>, it's time to initialize
the filesystems that will be used to house our data.  Initialize swap as follows:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mkswap /dev/hda2</i>
</pre>
<p>You can use the <c>mke2fs</c> command to create ext2 filesystems:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mke2fs /dev/hda1</i>
</pre>
<p>If you'd like to use ext3, you can create ext3 filesystems using <c>mke2fs -j</c>:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mke2fs -j /dev/hda3</i>
</pre>
<p>To create ReiserFS filesystems, use the <c>mkreiserfs</c> command:</p>
<pre>
# <i>mkreiserfs /dev/hda3</i>
</pre>

<note>You can find out more about using ext3 under Linux 2.4 at <uri>http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/ext3/ext3-usage.html</uri>.</note>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Mount partitions</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
Now, we'll activate our new swap, since we may need the additional virtual memory that
provides later:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>swapon /dev/hda2</i>
</pre>
<p>Next, we'll create the <path>/mnt/gentoo</path> and <path>/mnt/gentoo/boot</path> mountpoints,
and we'll mount our filesystems to these mountpoints. 
</p>
<pre>
# <i>mkdir /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>mkdir /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
# <i>mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
</pre>
<p>If you are setting up Gentoo
   Linux with a separate <path>/usr</path> or <path>/var</path>, these would get mounted to
   <path>/mnt/gentoo/usr</path> and <path>/mnt/gentoo/var</path>, respectively.
</p>
   <impo>If your <e>boot</e> partition (the one holding the kernel) is ReiserFS, be sure to mount it
   with the <c>-o notail</c> option so GRUB gets properly installed.  Make sure 
   that <c>notail</c> ends up in your new <path>/etc/fstab</path> boot partition entry, too.
   We'll get to that in a bit.</impo>
</body>

</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Mounting the CD-ROM</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Even though we've booted from the CD-ROM, the CD-ROM itself is not mounted under our minimal
Linux boot CD environment.  We'll need to mount it so that we can access the compressed build image
tarball contained on the CD-ROM.  To mount the CD-ROM, one typically types:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>mount /dev/cdroms/cdrom0 /mnt/cdrom -o ro -t iso9660</i>
</pre>
<p>With the CD-ROM mounted, you should be able to see the <c>stage???.tbz2</c> file(s) by typing
<c>ls /mnt/cdrom</c>.</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
    <title>Unpack the stage you want to use</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Now it's time to extract the compressed stage tarball of your choice to <path>/mnt/gentoo</path>.  Then, we'll <c>chroot</c> over to the new Gentoo Linux build installation. 
</p>

<impo>Be sure to use the <c>p</c> option with <c>tar</c>.  Forgetting to do this will cause certain files to contain incorrect permissions.</impo>

<impo>If you are using the "from scratch, build everything" install method, you will want to use the <path>stage1-ix86-1.2.tbz2</path> image.
If you're using one of our bigger CDs, you'll also have a choice of a stage2 and stage3 image.  These images allow you to save time at the
expense of configurability (we've already chosen compiler optimizations and default USE variables for you.)  The stage3 image now also includes complete linux sources and a Portage tree snapshot, eliminating the need to do an <c>emerge rsync</c> later.
</impo>

<pre>
# <i>cd /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>tar -xvjpf /mnt/cdrom/stage?-*.tbz2</i>
# <i>mount -o bind /proc /mnt/gentoo/proc</i>
# <i>cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/resolv.conf</i>
</pre>

<pre>
# <i>chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash</i>
# <i>env-update</i>
Regenerating /etc/ld.so.cache...
# <i>source /etc/profile</i>
# 
</pre>

<p>After you execute these commands, you'll be "inside" your new Gentoo Linux environment.
</p>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>Rsync</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Now, you'll need to run <c>emerge rsync</c>.  If you're using the a Gentoo Linux 1.1+ stage3 tarball,
<c>emerge rsync</c> is now optional as we've included a snapshot of the Portage tree for your convenience. <c>emerge rsync</c> will tell <c>emerge</c> to
connect to rsync.gentoo.org and download the latest version of our Portage ports tree:</p>

<pre>
# <i>emerge rsync</i>
</pre>
<p>The Portage tree will be downloaded; it's about 10Mb in size.</p>
<impo>The address for the rsync server is currently rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage.
  If you have trouble accessing Gentoo rsync, make sure you're
using this address by setting it as the SYNC variable in your /etc/make.conf.
</impo>
<note>The rsync command can be configured to use an HTTP proxy if you
are behind a firewall.  To configure this item set 
<i>RSYNC_PROXY="hostname:port"</i> in <i>/etc/make.conf</i> or set it as
an environment variable.
</note>

</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Progressing from stage1 to stage2</title>
<section>
<body>

<impo>If you are a stage2 or stage3 tarball, then we've already bootstrapped
for you.  There is no reason for you to bootstrap again, unless you decided to
do an <c>emerge rsync</c> and want to ensure that you have an up-to-the-minute
current Gentoo Linux system.  Most people using stage2 or stage3 tarballs will
<i>not</i> want to bootstrap again, since it can take up to an hour even on
very fast machines.</impo>

<p>Now that you have a working copy of the Portage tree, people using stage1 to
install will need to bootstrap their Gentoo Linux system as follows.  First
edit the file <path>/etc/make.conf</path>.  In this file, you should set your
<c>USE</c> flags, which specify optional functionality that you would like to
be built into packages; generally, the defaults (an <e>empty</e> or unset USE
variable) are fine.  You also should set appropriate <c>CHOST</c>, <c>
CFLAGS</c> and <c>CXXFLAGS</c> settings for the kind of system that you are
creating (commented examples can be found further down in the file.)  If
necessary, you can also set proxy information here if you are behind a
firewall.  </p>

<pre>
# <i>nano -w /etc/make.conf</i> <comment>(Adjust these settings)</comment>
</pre>
<note>
People who need to substantially tweak the build process should take a look at
the <path>/etc/make.globals</path> file.  This file comprises gentoo defaults and
should never be touched.  If the defaults do not suffice, then new values should
be put in <path>/etc/make.conf</path>, as entries in <path>make.conf</path>
<comment>override</comment> the entries in <path>make.globals</path>.  If you're
interested in tweaking USE settings, look in <path>/etc/make.profile/make.defaults</path>.
If you want to turn off any USE settings found here, add an appropriate <c>USE="-foo"</c>
in /etc/make.conf (to turn off the <c>foo</c> USE setting.)
</note>
<p>Now, it's time to start the "bootstrap" process.  This process will last 1-2 hours depending on 
how zippy your machine is; it takes about an hour on my 900Mhz AMD Athlon system.  During this
time, the extracted build image will be prepped for compiling the rest of the system.  The GNU
compiler suite will be built, as well as the GNU C library.  These are time consuming builds and
make up the bulk of the bootstrap process:</p>
<pre>
# <i>cd /usr/portage</i>
# <i>scripts/bootstrap.sh</i>
</pre>
<p>The "bootstrap" process will now begin.</p>
<note>
Portage by default uses <c>/var/tmp</c> during package building, often
using several hundred megabytes of temporary storage. If you would like to
change where Portage stores these temporary files, set a new PORTAGE_TMPDIR <e>before</e>
starting the bootstrap process, as follows:
</note>
<pre>
# <i>export PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/otherdir/tmp"</i>
</pre>
<p>
The 
<c>bootstrap.sh</c> will build <c>binutils</c>, <c>gcc</c>, <c>gettext</c>,
and <c>glibc</c>, rebuilding <c>binutils</c>, <c>gcc</c>, and <c>gettext</c>
after <c>glibc</c> is built.  Needless to say, this process takes a while.
Have a nice nap.  Once this process completes, your system will be in a "stage2" state.
</p>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Progressing from stage2 to stage3</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>Once your build image has been bootstrapped and you're at stage2 (again, if you're
using a stage3 tarball than these steps are not required)
it's time to build or install the rest of the base
system as follows:</p>

<pre>
# <i>export CONFIG_PROTECT=""</i>
# <i>emerge --pretend system</i>
	<comment>[lists the packages to be installed]</comment>
# <i>emerge system</i>
</pre>

<note>The <c>export CONFIG_PROTECT=""</c> line ensures that any new scripts
installed to <path>/etc</path> will overwrite the old scripts (stored in
<path>sys-apps/baselayout</path>), bypassing Portage's new config file
management support.  Type <c>emerge --help config</c> for more details.</note>

<p>It's going to take a while
to finish building the entire base system.  Your reward is that it will be
thoroughly optimized for your system.  The drawback is that you have to find a
way to keep yourself occupied for some time to come.  The author suggests "Star
Wars - Super Bombad Racing" for the PS2.  When <c>emerge system</c> completes,
you'll have a stage3 Gentoo Linux system.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Final steps: timezone</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>At this point, you should have a stage3 system that's ready for final configuration.  We'll start this process by setting the timezone.  By setting the timezone before building the kernel we ensure that
users get reasonable <c>uname -a</c> output.</p>
<p>Look for your timezone (or GMT if you using Greenwich Mean Time) in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>.  Then, make a symbolic link by typing:
</p><pre>
# <i>ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/path/to/timezonefile /etc/localtime</i>
</pre>
</body>
</section>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Final steps: kernel and system logger</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
If you're installing a Gentoo Linux 1.1+ stage3 tarball, we've made things convenient
for you and included recent Linux sources in <path>/usr/src/linux</path>.
Otherwise, you'll need to merge Linux source ebuilds.  Here are the ones we currently
offer:</p>

<p>Choose one and then merge as follows:</p>

<pre>
# <i>emerge sys-kernel/gentoo-sources</i>
</pre>

<p>Once you have a Linux kernel source tree available, it's time to compile your own custom kernel:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>
# <i>make dep &amp;&amp; make clean bzImage modules modules_install</i>
# <i>mv /boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage.orig</i> <comment>[if bzImage already exists]</comment>
# <i>cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot</i>
</pre>
<warn>For your kernel to function properly, there are several options that you will
need to ensure are in the kernel proper -- that is, they should <i>be enabled and not
compiled as modules</i>.  You will need to enable the <i>"Code maturity
level options --> Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"</i>
option to see several of these selections.
Under the "File systems" section, be sure to enable the <i>"Device File System"</i> (note that
you <e>don't</e> need to enable the "/dev/pts file system support" option). You'll also
need to enable the <i>"Virtual Memory Filesystem"</i>.  Be sure to enable "ReiserFS" if you have
any ReiserFS partitions; the same goes for "Ext3".  If you're using XFS, enable the 
"SGI XFS filesystem support"
option.  It's always a good idea to leave ext2
enabled whether you are using it or not.    Also, most people using IDE hard drives will
want to enable the "USE DMA by default" option; otherwise, your IDE drives may perform
very poorly.  Of course, remember to enable "IDE disk" support as well -- otherwise your
kernel won't be able to see your IDE disks.
</warn>
<impo>
If you have an IDE cd burner, then you need to enable SCSI emulation in the
kernel.  Turn on "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support" ---> "IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block 
devices" ---> "SCSI emulation support" (I usually make it a module), then
under "SCSI support" enable "SCSI support", "SCSI CD-ROM support" and
"SCSI generic support" (again, I usually compile them as modules).  If you
also choose to use modules, then <c>echo -e "ide-scsi\nsg\nsr_mod"
>> /etc/modules.autoload</c> to have them automatically added at boot time.
</impo>
<note>
For those who prefer it, 
it is now possible to install Gentoo Linux with a 2.2 kernel.
Such stability will come at a price: 
you will lose many of the nifty features that
are new to the 2.4 series kernels (such as XFS and tmpfs
filesystems, iptables, and more), although the 2.2 kernel sources can be
patched with ReiserFS and devfs support.  
Gentoo linux bootscripts require either tmpfs or ramdisk support in the kernel, so 
2.2 kernel users need to make sure that ramdisk support is compiled in (ie, not a module).
It is <comment>vital</comment> that a <e>gentoo=notmpfs</e> flag be added to the kernel
line in <path>/boot/grub/menu.lst</path> for the 2.2 kernel so that a ramdisk is mounted
for the bootscripts instead of tmpfs.  If you choose not to use devfs, then
<e>gentoo=notmpfs,nodevfs</e> should be used instead.
</note>

<p>
Your new custom kernel (and modules) are now installed.  Now you need to choose a system
logger that you would like to install.  We offer sysklogd, which is the traditional set
of system logging daemons.  We also have syslog-ng as well as metalog.  Power users seem
to gravitate away from sysklogd (not very good performance) and towards syslog-ng and 
metalog.  If in doubt, you may want to try metalog, since it seems to be quite popular.
To merge your logger of choice, type <e>one</e> of the next three lines:
</p>

<pre>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/sysklogd</i>
# <i>rc-update add sysklogd default</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>emerge app-admin/syslog-ng</i>
# <i>rc-update add syslog-ng default</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>emerge app-admin/metalog</i>
# <i>rc-update add metalog default</i>
</pre>
<warn>
In the case of syslog-ng you need to create 
<path>/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf</path>.
See <path>/etc/syslog-ng</path> 
for a sample configuration file.
</warn>
<impo>
Metalog flushes output to the disk in blocks, so messages aren't immediately recorded into
the system logs.  If you are trying to debug a daemon, this performance-enhancing behavior is less than helpful.  When your
Gentoo Linux system is up and running, you can send
metalog a USR1 signal to temporarily turn off this message buffering (meaning that 
<i>tail -f <path>/var/log/everything/current</path></i> will now work 
in real time, as expected), 
and a USR2 signal to turn buffering back on
again. 
</impo>
<p>Now, you may optionally choose a cron package that you'd like to use.  Right now, we offer dcron, fcron and vcron.
If you don't know which one to choose, you might as well grab vcron.  They can be installed as follows:</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/dcron</i>
# <i>crontab /etc/crontab</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/fcron</i>
# <i>crontab /etc/crontab</i>
<comment>or</comment>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/vcron</i>
</pre>

<title>Final steps: install additional packages</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>
You may need to install some additional packages in the Portage tree
if you are using any optional features like XFS, ReiserFS or LVM.  If you're
using XFS, you should emerge the <c>xfsprogs</c> ebuild:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/xfsprogs</i>
</pre>
<p>If you'd like to use ReiserFS, you should emerge the ReiserFS tools:
</p>
<pre>
# <i> emerge sys-apps/reiserfsprogs</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you're using LVM, you should emerge the <c>lvm-user</c> ebuild:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge --usepkg sys-apps/lvm-user</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you're a laptop user and wish to use your pcmcia slots on your first
real reboot, you'll want to make sure you install the pcmcia-cs package.
</p>
<pre>
# <i>emerge sys-apps/pcmcia-cs</i>

<title>Final steps: /etc/fstab</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Your Gentoo Linux system is almost ready for use.  All we need to do now is configure
a few important system files and install the GRUB boot loader. 
The first file we need to
configure is <path>/etc/fstab</path>.  Remember that you should use
the <c>notail</c> option for your boot partition if you chose to create a ReiserFS filesystem on it.
Remember to specify <c>ext2</c>, <c>ext3</c> or <c>reiserfs</c> filesystem types as appropriate.</p>
<p>Use something like the <path>/etc/fstab</path> listed below, but of course be sure to replace "BOOT",
"ROOT" and "SWAP" with the actual block devices you are using (such as <c>hda1</c>, etc.)</p>
<pre>
<comment>
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# noatime turns of atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't
# needed; notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage
# efficiency).  It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to 
# switch between notail and tail freely.

# &lt;fs&gt;           &lt;mountpoint&gt;   &lt;type&gt;   &lt;opts&gt;          &lt;dump/pass&gt;

# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.

<title>Final steps: /etc/hostname</title>

<p>Edit this file so that it contains your fully-qualified domain name on a single line, i.e. <c>mymachine.mydomain.com</c>.
</p>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Final steps: /etc/hosts</title>
<body>
<p>This file contains a list of ip addresses and their associated hostnames.  It's used by the system to resolve the IP addresses
of any hostnames that may not be in your nameservers.  Here's a template for this file:
</p><pre>
127.0.0.1      localhost
<comment># the next line contains your IP for your local LAN, and your associated machine name</comment>

<section>
<title>Final network configuration</title>
<body>
<p>
Add the names of any modules that are necessary for the proper functioning of your system to 
<path>/etc/modules.autoload</path> file (you can also add any options you
need to the same line.) When Gentoo Linux boots, these modules will be automatically
loaded.  Of particular importance is your ethernet card module, if you happened to compile
it as a module:
</p>
<pre caption="/etc/modules.autoload">
3c59x
</pre>
<p>Edit the <path>/etc/conf.d/net</path> script to get your network configured for your
first boot:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>nano -w /etc/conf.d/net</i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth0 default</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you have multiple network cards you need to create additional <path>net.eth<comment>x</comment></path>
scripts for each one (<comment>x</comment> = 1, 2, ...):
</p>
<pre caption="Multiple network interfaces">
# <i>cd /etc/init.d</i>
# <i>cp net.eth0 net.eth<comment>x</comment></i>
# <i>rc-update add net.eth<comment>x</comment> default</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you have a PCMCIA card installed, have a quick look into 
/etc/init.d/pcmcia to verify that things seem all right for your setup,
then add 
<pre>
depend() {
	need pcmcia
}
</pre>
on top of your <path>/etc/init.d/net.eth<comment>x</comment></path> file, 
for the pcmcia drivers to be autoloaded whenever your network is loaded.

Follow the directions in the file to configure the basic settings.  
All users will want to make sure that <c>CLOCK</c> is set to his/her

<title>Final steps: harddrive settings (hdparm)</title>
<body>
<p>
Unfortunately, hdparm tweaks such as you performed at the
beginning of this installation are not remembered between
reboots.  An easy fix is to add the necessary hdparm tweak
to <path>/etc/conf.d/local.start</path>:
</p>
<pre>
# <i>nano -w /etc/conf.d/local.start</i>
</pre>
<pre caption="add hdparm tweak to /etc/conf.d/local.start">
# This is a good place to load any misc.
# programs on startup ( 1>&amp;2 )

# turn on DMA on both harddrives
hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda
hdparm -d 1 /dev/hdb
</pre>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Final steps: configure GRUB</title>
<body>
<p>
The most critical part of understanding GRUB is getting comfortable with how GRUB refers to hard drives and partitions.
Your Linux partition <path>/dev/hda1</path> is called <path>(hd0,0)</path> under GRUB.  Notice the parenthesis around the hd0,0 - they are required.  
Hard drives count from zero rather than "a", and partitions start at zero rather than one.  So, <path>/dev/hdb3</path> gets translated to <path>(hd1,2)</path>, and <path>/dev/hdd7</path> gets translated to <path>(hd3,6)</path>.  After you've gotten the feel for that, convert your boot and root partition names to the GRUB format and write them down.  Now, it's time to install GRUB.
</p>

<p>The easiest way to install grub is to simply type <c>grub</c> at your chrooted shell prompt:
</p><pre>
# <i>grub</i>
</pre><p>You'll be presented with the <c>grub&gt;</c> grub command-line prompt.  Now, you need to type in the
right commands to install the GRUB boot record onto your hard drive.  In my example configuration,
I want to install the GRUB boot record on my hard drive's MBR (master boot record), so that 
the first thing I see when I turn on the computer is the GRUB prompt.  In my case, the commands
I want to type are:</p>
<pre>grub&gt; <i>root (hd0,0)</i>
grub&gt; <i>setup (hd0)</i>
grub&gt; <i>quit</i>
</pre>

<p>Here's how the two commands work.  The first <c>root ( )</c> command tells GRUB
the location of your boot partition (in our example, <path>/dev/hda1</path> or 
<path>(hd0,0)</path> in GRUB terminology.  Then, the second <c>setup ( )</c> command tells GRUB where to install the
boot record - it will be configure to look for its special files at the <c>root
( )</c> location that you specified.  In my case, I want the boot record on the
MBR of the hard drive, so I simply specify <path>/dev/hda</path> (also known as <path>(hd0)</path>).  If I were using
another boot loader and wanted to set up GRUB as a secondary boot-loader, I
could install GRUB to the boot record of a particular partition.  In that case,
I'd specify a particular partition rather than the entire disk.  Once the GRUB
boot record has been 
successfully installed, you can type <c>quit</c> to quit GRUB.  Gentoo Linux is
installed, but we need to create the <path>/boot/grub/menu.lst</path> file so that
we get a nice GRUB boot menu when the system reboots.  Here's how to do it.</p>

<p>Now, create the menu.lst file (<c>nano -w /boot/grub/menu.lst</c>), and add the following to it:</p>
<pre>
default 0
timeout 30
splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz

title=My example Gentoo Linux
root (hd0,0) 
kernel /boot/bzImage root=/dev/hda3 

<comment># Below needed only for people who dual-boot</comment>
title=Windows NT Workstation
root (hd0,5) 
chainloader +1
</pre>
<note>
The <path>menu.lst</path> file should end in "lst" as in "list", not "1st" as in "first".  Also, (hd0,0) should be 
written without any spaces inside the parentheses.
</note>
<impo>
If you set up scsi emulation for an IDE cd burner earlier, then to get it to
actually work you need to add an "hdx=ide-scsi" fragment to the kernel
line in menu.lst (where "hdx" should be the device for your cd burner).
</impo>
<p>After saving this file, Gentoo Linux installation is complete.  Selecting the first option will
tell GRUB to boot Gentoo Linux without a fuss.  The second part of the menu.lst file is optional, and shows you how to
use GRUB to boot a bootable Windows partition.</p>

<note>Above, <path>(hd0,0)</path> should point to your "boot" partition
(<path>/dev/hda1</path> in our example config) and <path>/dev/hda3</path> should point to
your root filesystem.  <path>(hd0,5)</path> contains the NT boot
loader.</note> <p>Also, if you need to pass any options to the kernel, simply
add them to the end of the <c>kernel</c> command.  We're already passing one option
(<c>root=/dev/hda3</c>), but you can pass others as well.  In particular, you can
turn off devfs by default (not recommended unless you know what you're doing) by
adding the <c>gentoo=nodevfs</c> option to the <c>kernel</c> command.

<note>Unlike in earlier versions of Gentoo Linux, you no longer have to add 
<c>devfs=mount</c> to the end of the <c>kernel</c> line to enable devfs.  In rc6
devfs is enabled by default.
</note>
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Installation complete!</title>
<section>
<body>
<p>Now, Gentoo Linux is installed.  The only remaining step is to exit the chrooted shell, safely unmount your partitions
and reboot the system:</p>
<pre>
# <i>exit</i> 
<codenote>This exits the chrooted shell; you can also type <c>^D</c></codenote>
# <i>cd / </i>
# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo/proc</i>
# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>reboot</i>
</pre>
<note>
After rebooting, it is a good idea to run the <c>update-modules</c> command to create
the <path>/etc/modules.conf</path> file.  Instead of modifying this file directly, you should
generally make changes to the files in <path>/etc/modules.d</path>.
</note>
