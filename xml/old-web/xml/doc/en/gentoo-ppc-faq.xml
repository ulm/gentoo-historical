<chapter>
	<title>Installation</title>

	<section>
		<title>My <path>/etc/fstab</path> file has <path>/dev/BOOT</path> in it, do I need to setup this line for my bootstrap partition?</title>
		<body><p>No. If you are not running a seperate boot partition (<path>/boot</path>) then you do not need this line and can safely just delete it from <path>/etc/fstab</path>.  The bootstrap partition is <e>not</e> <path>/boot</path> and is not related in anyway. In general, PowerPC machines do not need a seperate <path>/boot</path> partition, and the bootstrap partition should not be mounted.</p></body>

	<section>
		<title>When I try and install Gentoo on my PowerBook, my internal hard drive does not show up. What should I do?</title>
		<body><p>Pass <e>hda=1,1,1</e> to the kernel at boot time. That should solve your problems. You can do this at yaboot prompt by typing <c>boot hda=1,1,1</c>.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Installation is now complete. However, after my machine boots into Gentoo and I try to emerge anything, I see errors saying it cannot 'stat' a file. What is wrong?</title>
		<body><p>Check to see that your time is set correctly.  Also make sure that you have <e>not</e> enabled the <e>Enhanced RTC</e> option in the kernel (as stated in install guide). Setting your time and linking <path>/etc/localtime</path> to your proper timezone (in <path>/usr/share/zoneinfo</path>) will solve your problems.</p></body>

	<title>Laptop Support</title>

	<section>
		<title>I'm running Gentoo on a PowerPC laptop. What packages should I install to enable laptop-specific functionality?</title>
		<body><p>There are four main packages you will need to install.</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li><e>pmud</e> is the Power Management daemon for your hardware (similar to apmd on x86). Please note that pmud may also require a working sound device (<path>/dev/mixer</path>).</li>
				<li><e>pbbuttonsd</e> gives you the use of all the laptop buttons for volume, brightness, etc.</li>
				<li><e>gtkpbbuttons</e> gives you a gtk front end for pbbuttonsd (visual feedback on button presses in X).  <e>gtkpbbuttons</e> requires gtk and should be added to your X session file (<path>~/.Xsession</path>) for best results (so that it is always running while in X).</li>
				<li><e>powerprefs</e> ties together with pbbuttonsd, and gives you the ability to edit settings such as trackpad options and various other preferences.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>These packages can be installed by running the appropriate commands from the list below:
<pre>
# <c>emerge pmud; rc-update add pmud default</c>
# <c>emerge pbbuttonsd; rc-update add pbbuttonsd default</c>
# <c>emerge gtkpbbuttons</c>
# <c>emerge powerprefs</c>
</pre>
			</p></body>

	<section>
		<title>How can I configure my machine's Aiport or other Wi-Fi card?</title>
		<body><p>First, make sure you have support for the card complied into the kernel, or compiled as a module and loaded. Then, <c>emerge wireless-tools; iwconfig</c>.</p></body>
	</section>
</chapter>


<chapter>
	<title>Applications</title>

	<section>
		<title>How do I get sound output working?</title>
		<body><p>Two things are needed here. First, you have to make sure that you have the correct kernel options selected.  In make menuconfig you need:
<pre>
&lt;*&gt; Sound card support   
&lt;*&gt;   PowerMac DMA sound support  
<codenote>and</codenote>   
&lt;*&gt;   OSS sound modules 
</pre>
			(or selected as modules and loaded). Second, users who should have access to the audio devices need to be added to the appropriate group with the command <c>chmod -g audio [username]</c>.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Is there an easy way to configure X?</title>
		<body><p>Thanks to Gerk, you can <c>emerge xeasyconf; Xeasyconf</c>.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>I recently emerged XFree, but when using it, my international keyboard layout does not work correctly. The main keys work fine but I am unable to compose special characters like the "at" sign. The startx output says something like "could not load keymap, falling back to default keymap". What is wrong?</title>
		<body><p>Check that the permissions on <path>/var/tmp</path> are set to <path>drwxrwxrwx</path>. If not, change them by typing <c>chmod a+rwx /var/tmp</c>. This will allow XFree to load keymaps properly again.</p></body>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Can I run Mac OS or Mac OS X under Gentoo Linux?</title>
		<body><p>Yes, as long as your are running Gentoo PPC/Linux on Apple hardware (or a Mac-clone). You will need to run <uri link="http://www.maconlinux.org/">Mac-on-Linux</uri>. Just <c>emerge mol</c>. MOL support Mac OS 7.5.2 to 9.2.2, as well as OS X 10.1 and 10.2. It can take over your full screen, or run in a window.</p></body>

<title>Resources</title>
	<section>
		<title>Where can I find more information about Gentoo Linux?</title>
		<body><p>The official Gentoo documentation can be found on <uri>http://www.gentoo.org/</uri>; general Linux information is at <uri>http://www.linuxdoc.org</uri>; <uri>http://www.penguinppc.org/</uri> has information specific to running Linux on the PowerPC platform.</p></body>

	<section>
		<title>Can I buy a CD of Gentoo PPC/Linux?</title>
		<body><p>Yes! Fresh CDRs are available from <uri link="http://www.tuxcds.com/section.php?section=42"> tuxcds</uri> for a very good price. These people also bounce back a portion of the profits to the Gentoo project, so buy them while they are hot!</p>

	<section>
		<title>This FAQ hasn't answered my question. What do I do now?</title>
		<body><p>A good first step is to browse through the relevant <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/index-docs.html">documentation on www.gentoo.org</uri>. Two PPC-specific mailing lists currently exist, <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org/mailman/listinfo/gentooppc-dev">gentooppc-dev</uri> and <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org/mailman/listinfo/gentooppc-user">gentooppc-user</uri>. Both lists are archived online. Also, there is usually a lively discussion on IRC. Join us on <i>#gentoo-ppc</i> on <i>irc.freenode.net</i>.</p>
