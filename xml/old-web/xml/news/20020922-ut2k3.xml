	<title>UT2003 Gentoo LiveCD Update</title>
<body>

<p><b>A new release of our Unreal Tournament 2003 Gentoo LiveCD is now
available</b> and includes quite a few new enhancements. The Unreal Tournament
2003 Demo itself has been upgraded to the 1080c patchlevel, fixing numerous
quirks in the game itself. In addition, the UT2003 LiveCD now requires a
Pentium Classic or greater to run, and is optimized for P6-class systems like
the Pentium II and III (it was previously a relatively unoptimized i486+ CD.)
The new 1.4.1 CD now also includes support for monitors without EDID support, wheel
mice. In addition, machines with 512MB or more of RAM can now cache the entire UT2003 Demo to tmpfs (RAM) 
to dramatically enhance load-time performance. Oh, and our <c>pci-config</c> script will now correctly detect SoundBlaster
PCI 512 cards.</p><p>As before, our UT2003 LiveCD can be used to install Gentoo
Linux. <b>You can grab <c>livecd-ut2003-i586-1.4.1.iso</c> from <uri
link="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/distributions/gentoo/releases/1.4_rc1/">ibiblio</uri>
or one of our mirrors. Enjoy!</b> </p>
