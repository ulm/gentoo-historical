	Just wanted to let people know that the <uri link="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux">IBM developerWorks Linux Zone</uri> is

	<p>The most ambitious project we're working on is the series of eight <uri link="http://www.lpi.org">LPI certification tutorials</uri>.
	The purpose of this tutorial series is to provide you with the knowledge you need to attain LPIC Level 1 Linux Certification.  The first four tutorials [ <uri link="http://www-105.ibm.com/developerworks/education.nsf/linux-onlinecourse-bytitle/4AAA4E689F774DBC86256B4500645075?OpenDocument">part 1</uri> | <uri link="http://www-105.ibm.com/developerworks/education.nsf/linux-onlinecourse-bytitle/22D84C62513A001186256B4900603332?OpenDocument">part 2</uri> | <uri link="http://www-105.ibm.com/developerworks/education.nsf/linux-onlinecourse-bytitle/950C34908FADCDF186256B50007A8A4E?OpenDocument">part 3</uri> | <uri link="http://www-105.ibm.com/developerworks/education.nsf/linux-onlinecourse-bytitle/88D7118418A8604986256B52007F8C34?OpenDocument">part 4</uri> ] are already online, and the others will be appearing shortly.
