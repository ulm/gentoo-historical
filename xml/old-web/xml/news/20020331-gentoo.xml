	<title>Gentoo Linux 1.0 Released!</title>
<body>

<p><b>Gentoo Linux 1.0 has finally been released!</b>  You'll find <uri
link="/doc/build.html">install instructions here</uri> and <uri
link="http://www.ibiblio.org/gentoo/releases/build/">ISOs and build tarballs
here</uri> (and on our mirrors soon).  We've finally made it!  I'll be working
on making it possible to buy freshly-burnt up-to-date Gentoo Linux CDs through
the site in the coming weeks -- stay tuned!</p>

<p>I also want to point out the new icon in the upper-left corner.  <b><uri
link="http://www.uwyn.com">UWYN</uri> Belgium is a <i>very active</i>
contributor to Gentoo Linux development, having developed (among other things)
our extremely slick Portage path sandboxing technology.</b>  In addition, UWYN is
playing a very active role in the development of our second-generation Portage2
technology.  Of course, UWYN does more than just Gentoo Linux development --
they're experts in constructing custom solutions using <uri
link="http://www.uwyn.com/services/index.html">free software.</uri>  If you
need to find someone to help you tackle a challenging software development
project, consider UWYN.  I can highly recommend them, and their excellent work
on Gentoo Linux speaks for itself.</p>
