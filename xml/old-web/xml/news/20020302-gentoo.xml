	<title>Gentoo Linux ebuild freeze</title>
<body>
<p><b>In anticipation of a mid to late March release of Gentoo Linux 1.0, there is now a feature freeze on all new
non-essential ebuild submissions.</b>  The purpose of this ebuild freeze is to free developers for the huge stream of
new ebuild submissions so that they can focus on fixing bugs and adding improvements to key packages for Gentoo Linux
1.0.  We expect the ebuild freeze to last at least a couple of weeks.</p>
