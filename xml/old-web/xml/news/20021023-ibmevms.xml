	<title>New IBM dW article: Introduction to EVMS</title>
<body>

<p><b>IBM developerWorks is now featuring my <uri
link="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fs12/">Introduction
to EVMS</uri> article, the first of a two-part series on the technology (and 12th in the Advanced
Filesystem Implementor's Guide series.)</b> "EVMS" stands for Enterprise Volume
Management System, a technology developed by IBM to unify and enhance the various
storage technologies under Linux.  A few paragraphs from the article:</p>
<p><e> So,
taken as a whole, Linux has a tremendously rich set of storage-related
technologies. And therein lies the problem; taken as a whole, we do have some
great tools. But try to use several of these storage technologies together and
things become complicated. For example, let's imagine that we want to create a
ReiserFS filesystem that sits upon an LVM logical volume (so that it can be
dynamically expanded as needed), which in turn sits upon a RAID-1 software RAID
volume (in order to provide some protection against disk failure).
</e></p>

<p><e> To do this, we first add two new drives to our system, and then use
<c>fdisk</c> to set up partitions on each drive. Next, we specify an
<path>/etc/raidtab</path> file and use <c>mkraid</c> to enable our RAID-1
volume. Once we're done with that, we use <c>pvcreate</c>, <c>vgcreate</c>, and
<c>lvcreate</c> to create an LVM logical volume out of our RAID-1 volume.
Finally, we use <c>mkreiserfs</c> to create a filesystem on top of our new
logical volume. After all that work, our new ReiserFS filesystem is ready for
mounting.  </e> </p>
