	<title>Gentoo Linux/PPC fun!</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>All of us developers have been reeling from the
sudden, rapid growth of our userbase and are scrambling to catch up, but we've
also been having a lot of fun :)</b>  Thankfully, we now have some new
infrastructure in place to help support our new users, the most notable of which are
the new, super-slick <b><uri link="http://forums.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux
discussion forums at http://forums.gentoo.org</uri></b>.  Many thanks to Kyle for
taking the initiative to set them up -- they're awesome.</p>

<p>In addition to the forums, we now have an <b>alt.os.linux.gentoo</b>
newsgroup, several new <uri link="http://lists.gentoo.org">mailing lists</uri>
and new <b>#gentoo-user</b> and <b>#gentooppc</b> IRC channels.  Yes, you heard
me right -- thanks to some skilled and motivated PPC guys (<c>pvdabeel</c> and
<c>kain</c>, to be exact) there now exists <uri
link="http://gentooppc.sunsite.dk">Gentoo Linux for the PowerPC</uri>!  
It's now possible to run Gentoo Linux/PPC on Apple PowerBooks and
other PowerPC-based machines.  As time goes on, we'll be adding Gentoo
Linux/PPC-related resources to our site, as well as info on the forthcoming
Sparc and Sparc64 ports of Gentoo Linux.  The second half of 2002 promises to
be a very interesting time for Gentoo Linux.  Stay tuned...  </p>
