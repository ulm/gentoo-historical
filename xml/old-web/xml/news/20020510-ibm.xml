<body>

<p>Before I get to the tutorials, a quick note: <b>Edmund's Enterprises is now
<uri
link="http://www.edmunds-enterprises.com/linux/cart.php?ba=pdtl&amp;product=117">selling
Gentoo Linux 1.1a CDs</uri> for only $0.99 USD + $1.99 shipping.</b>  Many
thanks to Edmund's Enterprises for this valuable (and super-inexpensive)
service!</p>

<p>Now, for the tutorial info: <b>IBM developerWorks is now featuring parts 1
through 4 of my LPI-102 certification tutorials.</b>  This set of tutorials
will help to teach you the Linux system administration skills that you need to
know in order to pass the <uri link="http://www.lpi.org">Linux Professional
Institute's</uri> LPI-102 certification test (there is also another series of
four tutorials focused on skills needed for the LPI-101 test.)  Here's a <uri

to part 4 of the first LPI-102 tutorial</uri> which also contains links to the
others.  These tutorials were written by me (Daniel Robbins), Chris Houser and
Aron Griffis and are a <b>great</b> resource for those wanting to beef up their
Linux system administration skills.  The LPI-102 tutorial series covers
compiling applications for sources, Debian and Red Hat package management,
kernel configuration and compilation, Linux hardware support, Linux networking,
ssh, NFS and more.  </p>
