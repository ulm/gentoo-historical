	<title>Keychain 2.0 released</title>
<body>
<p>
<b>I released version 2.0 of keychain (a SSH RSA/DSA key management application) today; this new release includes various bug fixes and performance improvements,</b>
commercial SSH2 support and HP-UX and Cygwin compatibility fixes. In addition, keychain files are now stored
by default in a <path>~/.keychain/</path> directory and are now intuitively named <path>sh-${HOSTNAME}</path> and <path>csh-${HOSTNAME}</path>. Keychain 2.0 also includes a new command-line option <c>--dir</c> that can be used to set the location where Keychain will look for its files, and the <c>--local</c> option has been deprecated. <b>You can grab Keychain on our <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/projects/keychain/">Keychain projects page</uri>.</b> Enjoy!
