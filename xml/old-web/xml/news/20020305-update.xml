<p><b>Be sure to check out the new <uri link="/index-graphics.html">Graphics</uri> section and our new "Powered by Gentoo Linux" logo.</b>  Developers will also be interested in Grant Goodyear's new <uri link="/doc/uml.html">User-Mode Linux Guide</uri>.  Like <uri link="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</uri>, User-Mode Linux will allow you to run a virtual Linux system on your PC.  But unlike VMWare, User-Mode Linux is free :)  Also, <uri link="http://freshmeat.net/releases/71626/">a new version 1.9 of keychain</uri> (a <c>ssh-agent</c> manager) has been released.  Enjoy!  Work on Gentoo Linux 1.0 continues to go well.
