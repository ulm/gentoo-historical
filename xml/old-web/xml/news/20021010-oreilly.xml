<p><b>A new article introducing Gentoo Linux written by Daniel Robbins</b> is
featured on O'Reilly Network's Web site today. In the article, a brief
overview of some of the features of Gentoo Linux, Daniel expounds on what
kinds of enhancements users can expect in the 1.4 final release: support for
true 64-bit on the UltraSparc architecture, KDE 3.0.4, a gentoo-sources
kernel with Andrea Archangeli's 3.5GB "user address space" patch and grsec,
and of course the new Gentoo Reference Platform for fast binary
