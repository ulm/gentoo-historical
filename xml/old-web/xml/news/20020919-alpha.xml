<body>
<p>
<b>We are proud to announce Gentoo Linux for the Alpha processor!</b> In a testament
to the power and flexibility of the Portage system and Gentoo Linux, Bjoern
Brauel (aka "bjb") has done the amazing job of creating a whole new port for
Gentoo Linux in the span of 2 (yes, TWO) days (yes, DAYS). Currently, Bjoern
has Xfree86, GNOME 2, Gimp and other things running on Gentoo Linux/Alpha, as you can see in <uri

being incorporated into our Portage tree; in the mean time, the adventurous may
be interested in playing with the <uri

tarball</uri>. Many thanks to Bjoern for his excellent work in launching the
Gentoo Linux/Alpha development effort.
