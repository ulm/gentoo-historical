<ferringb> je_fro: just made me think of a horrible movie preview they're
           running for spiderman-3 that seems to be based around beatles
           songs...
<nightmorph> "norwegian wood"?
<nightmorph> "my spider sense is tingling!"
<nightmorph> "THAT's not your spider sense!"
<je_fro> quick...cleanse the palate with some tubgirl or goatse
<nightmorph> "yeah baby, tingle my spider sense"
<nightmorph> and that had better not end up on robbat2's list of quotes. i
             wouldn't be able to explain that one to my wife...
