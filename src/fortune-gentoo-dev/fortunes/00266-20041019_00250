<ChrisWhite> That's sad, I just now realized I go to school tommorow
<KrispyKringle> i look forward to it. when the semester starts, there 
 are suddenly tons of nubile young freshman girls wandering the halls 
 looking for directions.
<KrispyKringle> ``Why, yes, it does look like my dorm room, but I assure 
 you, freshman orientation really is this direction.''
