<Stuart> assuming avian flu eventually makes it to a pandemic, I wonder 
 how many devs we'll lose to it?
<rl03> Stuart: that's your only question about bird flu? how many devs 
 we'll lose??
<idl> rl03: I suppose he includes arch testers with that..
<rl03> idl: oh right. much better
<ferringb> doesn't care about forums staff though ;)
