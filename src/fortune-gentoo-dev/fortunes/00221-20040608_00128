<ciaranm> unfortunately, if you accept ayer's theories, then ayer's 
 theories are meaningless
<spyderous> therefore you can't accept his theories
<spyderous> heh
<ciaranm> spyderous: actually, you can take his theories to be 
 self-evident, in which case it's okay
<rac> ciaranm: when dealing with descartes/rousseau/kant/etc, ayer is 
 the equivalent of the BFG
<seemant> isn't that accepting them?
<seemant> big friendly giant?
<ciaranm> spyderous: it's only when you try to justify them that you 
 have problems
<seemant> bah, I need tylenol now
<seemant> and a good dose of imake
