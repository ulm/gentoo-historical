<Cardoe> where do you work?
<ChrisWhite> OfficeMax
<SuperLag> The OfficeMax here SUCKS
<SuperLag> there's one 2 blocks from my house, and getting service takes 
 an act of Congress
<ChrisWhite> See, that's why I hate large franchises
<ChrisWhite> Service is so relative
<SuperLag> Agreed.
<ChrisWhite> cause not in my store :P
<ChrisWhite> I do some pole dancing when you first walk in
<ChrisWhite> then it starts to get slow.. not sure why
