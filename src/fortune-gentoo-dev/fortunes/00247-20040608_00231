<ciaranm> hrm... do i want to do a fluxbox 0.9.9-r1 with the crash fix 
 patch?
<ciaranm> or do i wait until someone actually reports it as being 
 broken? :)
<klieber> ciaranm: fluxbox 0.9.9 crashes.  plzfix.  kthx.
<ciaranm> klieber: what're you doing to trigger the crash? :P
<klieber> ciaranm: shakin' my booty.
<klieber> it just can't handle it
<port001> ciaranm: no one uses fluxbox, thats why
<klieber> port001: sshhh...the adults are talking.
<ciaranm> isn't it past his bedtime?
* port001 goes back to his room
<tseng> I'd laugh
<tseng> but then klieber would put me in my place too
