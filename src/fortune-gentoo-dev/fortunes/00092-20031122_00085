<`Kumba> what I'm getting at is whatever language we use for the core 
 needs to be fast as a tachyon and about as lightweight as one (well, 
 okay, so they have imaginary mass), so I think this kinda rules out a 
 few language choices
<hythloday> `Kumba: assembler!
<`Kumba> ehh, portable too :P
<hythloday> `Kumba: it works on my athlon *and* my p4 - of course it's 
 cross-platform.
