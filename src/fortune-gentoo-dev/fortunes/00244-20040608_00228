<gerrynjr> summer should be interesting.. my job at the UNI will entail 
 setting up 5 g5 systems.. LDAP authentication for over 700 users
<gerrynjr> as well as storage
<carpaski> Where do you store 700 users?
<carpaski> I suppose a garage or a hole in the ground would do.
<carpaski> Just make sure it has a lock.
