<jeeves> armin76: unable to find nirbheek ; Perhaps 
         one of us is malfunctioning?
* nirbheek stabs armin76
* omp stabs armin76
* nightmorph takes away the knives. who left out 
  all the sharp objects?
<bonsaikitten> nightmorph: well, what are you 
               going to do when someone attacks you
               with a  ....  banana?
* nirbheek continues stabbing with his sharp, 
  long nails
<nightmorph> bonsaikitten: that's too freudian 
             to respond to
<bonsaikitten> heh. you obviously don't watch 
               enough Monty Python
<nirbheek> nightmorph, when the f are you going to 
           make quotes like this immortal by adding
           them to fortune-mod-gentoo-dev? :p
<nightmorph> nirbheek: save it in your local 
             quotesfile for later.  then...then we
             can fix it!
