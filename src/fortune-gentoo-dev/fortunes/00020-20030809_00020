[discussing the pronounciation of gif]
<seemant> I say it with soft g
<seemant> coz like I envision this exchange:
<seemant> "hey, <so-and-so> I have a gif for you" <-- hard g
<seemant> where <so-and-so> will reply "ooh for me? you shouldn't 
 have!  it's not even my birthday"
<seemant> and then you're in an embarrassing situtation
