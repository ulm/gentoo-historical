<nightmorph> oh well. i like checking out that 3-million dollar Sun 
 mainframe advertised on their website, just because 128 sparc IVs + 
 accompanying ram ignites tech lust within my loins
<tsunam> nightmorph: if that ignites your loins...you should have that 
 checked out, and find a woman who ignites them instead
<nightmorph> i do, i got married :p
<nightmorph> (just don't tell her about the sun thing ;))
<tsunam> haha
