<MattM> Hrm. My son just asked to sit on daddys lap while he was working 
 so that he could see the computer screen (desk is too high for him, 
 he's only 2.8 yrs old).  A few minutes later, he peed and I'm wondering 
 whats that liquid on my leg...ouch.  Am I a father or a dog owner...
<MattM> brb
<ChrisWhite> ... wtf :P
