<jforman> i always burnt stuff with mine. chicken came out too dry. i 
 think it was because i had the 1st generation grill in college. i 
 ditched it by my 2nd year
<avenj> sure, blame the grill
<jforman> avenj: how could i screw this up...it didnt even have an off 
 and on button. you ripped the cord out of the wall. i dont think even I 
 could screw that up ;)
<avenj> hehe
<avenj> it's ok, i'm sure somebody will love you even though you can't 
 cook and don't look good in a dress
<jforman> avenj: i know, my self esteem was shot when even latexer 
 wouldnt pick me up in the new spring fashions
