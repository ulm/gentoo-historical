<Sput> somebody know the problem on intel graphics
       that scrolling seems to be quite laggy?
       especially in kdevelop but also in general...
       tried stable X, git master X, new and old
       drivers... to no avail
<Sput> started a few weeks ago and I have no idea
       what has caused that
<Sput> desktop effects are smooth and all, but I
       can't scroll smoothly
<Sput> kde4 of course :)
<nirbheek> There's your problem right there
<Sput> meh :P
