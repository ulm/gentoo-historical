<psypete> rac: really i'm looking to work on linux FOR amd64, and as yet 
 don't have plans for a testbed unless one is donated. i just want to 
 know what's involved with using an amd64 system, etc
<drobbins> psypete: girly giggles
<drobbins> psypete: to use an amd64, you have to giggle like a girl
