<sethbc> what does disaster recovery software do
<sethbc> what kinds of disasters we talkin about
<klieber> loss of a single server, loss of a datacenter, etc.
<sethbc> ah so not like a natural disaster 
<klieber> it can be, but it's not just that.
<avenj> it could be an earthquake or it could be someone spilling a cup 
 of coffee on your server
<klieber> or it could be guns'n'roses getting back together...
