<drobbins> after this blog post, I'm going to request that everyone 
 refer to me by my new alias: "dro"
<dberkholz> Dr. Dro
<drobbins> because my blog post was that good
<drobbins> Dr. Dro. Even better.
<drobbins> Dr. Dro, RN
<drobbins> that's Dr. Dro, male nurse to y'all
<drobbins> ok, that's getting a bit weird
