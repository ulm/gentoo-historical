<Blackb|rd> You know, sometimes it's hard not to scream at the
            disabled. Today I rode in my care with a friend of mine.
            At an intersection, it took me quite a while to sport a
            gap in traffic. He, always helpful said "Well, I don't see
            any oncoming cars on my side." So I started to enter the
            intersection, thinking twice then slamming the brakes.
            He's *blind*.
