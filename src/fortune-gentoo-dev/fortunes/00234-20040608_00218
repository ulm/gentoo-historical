<squinky86> ok, it sounds like it's hailing outside...it's getting too 
 bad, I'm going y'all.  I love Alabama...
<ciaranm> alabama has the internet?
<squinky86> ciaranm: when I come back, I'll get you and klieber for your 
 anti-alabama comments.  Bye
<klieber> squinky86: I'm not anti-alabama.  I think it's a quaint little 
 town.
<squinky86> klieber: hey, that's mean.  We have plenty of stuff here! 
 There's NASA, and the Space and Rocket Center...and a big NASA 
 building...oh, and a Hooters.
<klieber> mmmm....Hooters
<klieber> delightfully tacky, yet unrefined.
