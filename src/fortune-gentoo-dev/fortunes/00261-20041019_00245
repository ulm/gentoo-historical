<rac> jstubbs: perl is garbage collected. however, circular references
 will confuse it
<rac> jstubbs: so if you have circular references, you have to break
 the circularity manually
<jstubbs> rac: so if references aren't being used and everything is
 defined using "my" within a function that gets called from a loop, is
 it normal for it to continuously eat memory?
<rac> jstubbs: why do i feel like if i say "no", i'm going to get a
 bug filed on my head? :)
