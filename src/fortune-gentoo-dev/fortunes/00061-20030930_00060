[discussing the SCO lawsuit]
<wwoods> there would be a guy in every courthouse whose job it
 was to read the executive summary of the lawsuit
<wwoods> say his name is Carl.
<wwoods> and if you're like. "I want to sue IBM for using stuff
 that's mine, even though it isn't technically mine and I gave
 it away for free."
<wwoods> and Carl would say "that's the stupidest thing I've
 ever heard."
<wwoods> case closed.
<wwoods> dismissed due to Carl.
