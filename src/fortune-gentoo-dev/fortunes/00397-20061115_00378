<ciaranm> sadly, being able to breed does not require intelligence
<ciaranm> unless you're a panda
<spb> mating just requires finding the right hole, which gives you a 
 50/50 chance of getting it right even with absolutely zero intelligence
<bonsaikitten> spb, 33% chance
<ehmsen> spb: 1/3 chance
<ehmsen> :-)
<ciaranm> spb: you suck at anatomy
<spb> well, depends whether you already know the general area
<bonsaikitten> and the bellybutton might be another 5%
<spb> else you could argue for a one in seven chance
<ciaranm> nobody has sex in the nostrils dude
<spb> or the ear, come to that
<spb> but still
