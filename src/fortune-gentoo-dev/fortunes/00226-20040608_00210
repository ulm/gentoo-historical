<Blkdeath> Incidentally, I found the source of my low-sound problem 
 since switching to 2.6.x and ALSA. Set a "VIA DXS" control to 100% and 
 damn near blew my ceiling to splinters.
<Blkdeath> So who in d'hell decided that PCM and Master weren't good 
 enough? Huh? Huh? Huh? I think I wish to have words with that 
 individual.
<klieber> it was me.
<klieber> bring it on.
