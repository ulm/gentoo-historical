<beejay> do we have _real_ ebuild freaks in here ?
<beejay> I need an ebuild
<robbat2> for what?
<beejay> if I "emerge clean_room" - my room including the inside of my 
 tower should be clean
<robbat2> hmm, that should be doable. thought you might ask for "emerge 
 life" to get a life, which would be a little harder
<beejay> Otherwise I have to install that package manually this 
 afternoon ;)
<wesolows> sorry, that depends on sys-life/woman, which is masked on 
 your platform
