<klieber> iggy: why did you remove all the kernel sources from portage 
 and replace them with pictures of the teletubbies?
<iggy> klieber: teletubbies, I thought I was putting part of my pr0n 
 collection in there
<iggy> oh, right, my pr0n collection consists of mostly teletubbies
<iggy> I'm seeing a doctor about that
<zhen> iggy: ah, so you are the one that always drove the rusted van 
 around the neighborhood trying to sell ice cream
<zhen> you know, the one that latexer always flocked to
<iggy> yeah, I know latexer _very_ well
<ciaranm> in the biblical sense?
<iggy> in the inside and out sense
* latexer feels dirty
