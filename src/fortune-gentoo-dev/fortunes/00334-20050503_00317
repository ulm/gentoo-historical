<lewk^> no, i applied for some Kernel Test Engineer bullshit, but Bill 
 Nottingham was like "I'm kinda out of the HR loop.. i just get handed 
 resumes.. so i don't even know what position you applied for"
<lewk^> the internship i interviewed for isn't on the site :/
<lewk^> if it were on the site, i'm pretty sure the job title would be 
 "Bill Nottingham's Bitch"
<lewk^> but i'm cool with it ;)
