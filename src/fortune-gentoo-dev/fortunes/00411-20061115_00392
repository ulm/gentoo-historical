<beejay> avenj: are you still maintaining the fortunes-collection?
<avenj> beejay: yes
<beejay> avenj: do you also take quotes that might be offensive?
<beejay> "might"
<avenj> depends
<seemant> so you're saying that if I were to say "beejay: go fuck 
 yourself", that wouldn't make it?
<avenj> it might, if it makes me giggle
<seemant> beejay: don't actually go fuck yourself, though -- that was 
 just an example
