<drobbins> the person on the extreme left is  thinking "I am wearing
 teeny tiny glasses"
<drobbins> the person with the black shirt (to his  right) is thinking
 "I am also wearing teeny tiny glasses"
<drobbins> the person behind him in the blue shirt  is thinking "I
 know you want to wear my teeny tiny glasses"
<drobbins> and the guy with the light patterned  shirt with the thumb
 in his belt loop is thinking "I do not need  glasses. but if I did,
 I would choose teeny tiny ones."
<drobbins> then there's two guys on the right who  are from the teeny
 glasses mafia
<raker> drobbins: it sounds like you have hit the point
 of insanity :)
<drobbins> raker: correction: the parisian teeny glasses mafia
