<tberman> gah, i got in a fight today with a hardware wholesaler
<tberman> he was telling me that you cant fit a dual xeon into a desktop 
 case that we had selected for our customers, that we needed to buy a 
 tower case
<tberman> he said, and i quote 'it wont fit into the atx case, it needs 
 something bigger'
<tberman> then he tried to sell me on a 2U rack case
