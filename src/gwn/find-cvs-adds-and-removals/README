This script MUST run locally on the CVS server.
While it is possible to modify it to run over the network, that requires
parsing of the entire 'history' file, which is an absolute IO hog.

By running it locally, we grab the last N lines (currently N=50000) of the
'history' file, and do the various magic on them.

The crontab file is included for running it.

As of 2006/Feb/07, it is running from robbat2's homedir on cvs.g.o.

history.sample is a small sample of the history file.
