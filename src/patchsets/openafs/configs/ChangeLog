		These ebuilds contain material contributed by (a.o.) Gerte Hoogewerf
		and Michael Hordijk.
		- split into kernel and user space-ebuilds
		- kernel module now installed in /lib/module/$(kernel_pointed_to_by_/usr/src/linux)
		- less failure-prone init-script
		- init-script doesn't check mounts anymore (cache, server partitions, ...)
			(i.e. you don't need to put them on seperate partitions anymore)
		- everything now installed in FHS-compliant locations
			ebuild contains transition code, however, do proceed with caution!!
		- documented some changes in README
