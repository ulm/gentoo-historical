From 1.4 to 1.6, some gentoo patches have been ported, but many patches have been dropped:

003_all_amd64-with-pam.patch	applied by upstream
004_all_use-local-paths.patch	applied by upstream
005_all_fs-include-fix.patch	applied by upstream
009_all_shared-libs.patch	upstream doesn't seem to use mapfiles anymore, so the patch is superfluous
011_all_alpha-ucontext.patch	dropped because alpha has not been supported for quite a while
012_all_kbuild.patch		was not used anymore
013_all_headers.patch		applied by upstream
