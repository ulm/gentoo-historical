	maketest.patch: some smbcontrol tests require sandbox write permission to
		various samba cache system dirs: removed (with -sandbox, they succeed)
	python_bindings.patch: deprecated function wrappers removed

	This is the second patchset for samba-3.0.14a, which fixes the
	/usr/bin/*.old problem. Essentially, to clean up the ebuild, I decided to
	patch the Makefiles to install torture programs, other scripts (patch 010);
	and make smbmnt, smbumount and mount.cifs setuid (patch 011).  The
	remaining patches in general are the prior patches from previous ebuilds,
	which allow libdir to be symlink on 64-bit, allow python setup to work
	properly, and fix the uid32 issue with smumount on every architecture.
	The statfs patch (004) can be applied on all architectures as well.
	Finally, the vscan patch is in its own directory due to its specific
	nature.
