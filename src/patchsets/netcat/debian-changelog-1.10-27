 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun,  3 Oct 2004 17:49:33 -0400

netcat (1.10-25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Included new example script, ncmeter, by Karsten KÃ¶m <koem@petoria.de>.
  * Added patch by Mike Sullivan <msully4321@gmail.com> to allow the use of
    port names containing "-", as long as the dash is escaped with a
    backslash. (e.g. "netcat localhost 'ftp\-data'"). (Closes: #10486)
  * Updated 12_single_verbose to be quiet if -z is on. (Closes: #247895)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1.

netcat (1.10-23) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Waiting for Paolo" release.
  * Use dpatch. I really should have done this a while ago.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun, 24 Aug 2003 11:34:27 -0400

netcat (1.10-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Broke apart all the various patches that have accumulated over the years,
    and put them in a crappy, ad-hoc DBS-like system. This is nowhere near
    perfect, but I'd rather wait for the new dpkg-source than muck around with
    my 4.5-year-old .orig.tar.gz just so I can repack things in such a way
    that DBS is usable. In the long run, separating the patches should make
    maintenance much easier, although technically getting that to work
    (without simply using DBS) may take a few tries. I'm not going to attempt
    to get this into Woody or anything.
  * Applied patch to prevent possible buffer overflow (Closes: #145801)
  * Updated URL and email in debian/netcat.copyright (Hobbit has been at
    @Stake for a while; I sent him a ping email with the split-up patches.)
  * The nc binary is now installed into /bin (thanks to Robot101, doogie, and
    dsp for bringing this up on IRC.) As far as I can tell, there aren't
    really any general-purpose networking tools available on a Debian system
    without /usr mounted, and this should hopefully fix that. If anyone
    disagrees I'd be happy to listen to whatever objections they have. Perhaps
    netcat's priority should be raised to standard in light of this, but I'll
    wait and see.

netcat (1.10-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved around shutdown call in -q patch to be more compatible with standard
    nc. Thanks to Dmitry Chernyak <cdl@inkasbank.ru> for pointing this out.
  * Applied UDP broadcast patch from NetBSD (Closes: #108182)
    - Updated man page to document this option
    - Also applied patch to use inet_aton instead of IADDR_NONE (which is
      obsolete), so that it will work.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.6

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Tue,  9 Oct 2001 18:08:24 -0400

netcat (1.10-19) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Fri,  1 Jun 2001 13:13:25 -0400

netcat (1.10-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added include for <resolv.h>, which is needed to compile with recent
    versions of glibc.
  * Added patch to always print "connection refused" messages, without having
    to turn on the other junk that -v prints. (Closes: #65413)
  * Upgraded to debhelper 3 and policy 3.5.2.0.
  * Added DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS =~ /debug/ support.

  * Updated debhelper rules to v2. Also cleaned up/moved some targets and dh_*
    options.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.2.1.0.
  * Compress README file, as per policy.
  * Applied -q patch properly (Closes: #62402). I think that this is also what
    caused #71616, but I'll hold off on closing that one.
  * Added README.Debian explanation about -e. This is possibly the problem
    behind #66355, so maybe I can close that as well.
