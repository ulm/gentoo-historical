Gentoo releng Release Notes Generator (genrelnotes.sh)
John Davis <zhen@gentoo.org> 4 Jan 2004

In this directory you will find a release notes template and release notes
generator. The generator is a tool that will take some of the busy work out
of creating release notes by first asking you some questions, sedding the template
to put the answers to those questions in the correct place, and then
(via genrelnotes.sh genall) create an updated .xml, .html, and .txt version of the template
for whatever arch/ release you chose.

After you complete the release notes by filling in the meat of the information (sorry, no
tool here), you will have to publish them with the release. The .xml version will get published
on the gentoo.org website in your arch's / team's appropriate place and the .html and .txt
versions will get included on the liveCD for the end user's consumption.

genrelnotes.sh is rather straight forward - just fun it straight up or with -h, --help, etc
for usage info.

If you have any questions, bug reports, etc - just mail me (zhen@gentoo.org)
