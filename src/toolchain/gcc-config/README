gcc-config 2.0

gcc-config 2.0 is incompatible with previous versions of gcc-config.  A
migration path has not been implemented yet.

With gcc-config 2.0, the configuration options have expanded.  The wrapper now
uses the configuration find the execuatble to fork off rather than searching through
the $PATH.  Each CHOST has a profile associated with it.  The CHOST used by the wrapper
is determined by the first matching criteria:

1) If the executable is called with a CHOST prefix, it is used.
2) If the CHOST environment variable is set, it is used.
3) The default CHOST is used.

configuration directory: /etc/gcc-config
All configuration information is stored in this directory.  The current config
format is as follows, but it is subject to change before release.

The selection file (/etc/gcc-config/selection.conf) lists the currently selected
profiles for each CHOST handled by gcc-config.  It is formatted as follows:
[global]
	default_chost = <*default chost>

[<chost 1>]
	profile = <*version>/<*profile>

[<chost 2>]
...

Configuration file (for each installed gcc package) is named /etc/gcc-config/<version>.conf formatted as follows:
[global]
	version = <*version>
	binpath = <*binpath>
	infopath = <infopath>
	manpath = <manpath>

[<profile 1>]
	chost = <*default CHOST>
	spec = <gcc spec file>
	ldpath = <path to add to ld.so.conf>
	cflags = <additional CFLAGS to prepend to the command line>

[<profile 2>]
...

Note that the <default CHOST> in the profile section is only used as a way to tell the user what
this profile is used for.  It is the header under which this profile falls when the user issues 'gcc-config -l',
but it can be overwridden with the --chost=<chost> command line option to set <chost> in the selection.conf.
The <chost> set in selection.conf determines how the binaries act.  The <default chost> in selection.conf
determines how the binaries 'gcc', 'g++', etc (that is the ones without a prefix) behave.  Options with asterisks
next to them are required.  Empty values will be assumed for the rest if absent.

Example /etc/gcc-config/selection.conf:
[global]
	default_chost = i686-pc-linux-gnu

[i686-pc-linux-gnu]
	profile=i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.4/vanilla

Example /etc/gcc-config/i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.4.conf:
[global]
	version=i686-pc-linux-gnu-3.4.4
	binpath=/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/3.4.4
	manpath=/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4/man
	infopath=/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4/info

[vanilla]
	chost=i686-pc-linux-gnu
	ldpath=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4
	spec=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4/vanilla.spec

[hardened]
	chost=i686-pc-linux-gnu
	ldpath=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4
	spec=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4/hardened.spec
