gcc.eselect is maintained in the Gentoo eselect svn repository:
svn co svn+ssh://<username>@svn.gentoo.org/var/svnroot/eselect/

gcc-config is a frontend to this eselect module which allows backwards compatibility
and a familiar interface to users of the gcc-config-1.X series.  It is subject to
removal at a future date.
