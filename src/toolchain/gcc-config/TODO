Neccessary:
* toolchain.eclass needs to intelligently activate profiles for all abis when
  installing a multilib compiler
* migration script needs to intelligently determine correct profile to
  activate.  It guesses right if it created the conf, but it doesn't guess
  right for confs created by toolchain.eclass
