Neccessary:
* Write file-parsing callbacks to handle readinf config files
* Write profile-manager which will profide info on as well as set the data in
  in /etc/env.d/05gcc and /etc/gcc-config/* (and in the future ~/.gcc-config/)
* Write eselect module to which will call profile-manager, setup /usr/bin, and
  any other quirks that come up
* Write gcc-config which will be a frontend to the eselect module providing
  users with a backwards compatible interface while people get used to eselect
