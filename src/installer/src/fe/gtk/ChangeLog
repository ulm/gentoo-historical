*GLI-gtkfe-0.01 (11 Dec 2004)

  17 Jan 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Added blurb about me being lazy to Welcome. Turned off pretend mode for
  gtkfe

  17 Jan 2005; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Networking.py - changed from combobox to comboentrybox.  Redid some of the
  logic used to make the user experience better.
  Widgets.py - added an errorbox2 that has okay and cancel.

  16 Jan 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  RunInstall.py called poll_notifications() in gtk idle loop and progress
  bar/status display work. Take ~5 fscking hours to figure out that pygtk
  is fscking retarted and locks its thread so python won't switch to
  another thread :(

  15 Jan 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  USE flag editor in MakeDotConf.py. Fix double spacing issue for USE flags.
  USE flag editor now generated proper + and - USE line. CFLAGS ComboBoxes
  and Entry in MakeDotConf. CFLAGS is set in InstallProfile. MakeDotConf does
  CHOST, ACCEPT_KEYWORDS, MAKEOPTS, and FEATURES. New screen/code to actually
  run the install.

  15 Jan 2005; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Networking.py - added support for a custom ethernet device.
  Fixed a lot of little bugs having to do with user interaction,
  and added support for loading from the .xml file.
  Networking.py - added support for hostname and dnsdomainname.

  14 Jan 2005; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Timezone.py - fixed bug where after selecting a timezone, it would jump
  to the parent of the selection.
  Networking.py - fixed bug where some fields would be available if device
  was selected and was dhcp.  also integrated into backend ( one way only
  so far, only will save, not load settings yet ).  Added error box to
  ask the user if they want to replace settings or cancel if the device
  is already listed.
  
  14 Jan 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Added description to the top of NetworkMounts and changed the spacing
  of the description on Partitioning. In NetworkMounts, activate() now
  disables all buttons except 'New'. NetworkMounts now does field
  validation. Welcome.py code cleanups. Created Template.py based on
  Welcome.py. Rewrote Stage.py from scratch. Rewrote PortageTree.py.
  Added set_size_request() calls in PortageTree and Stage for alignment.
  Rewrote Kernel.py. Rewrote Daemons.py. Added sysklogd to loggers section
  of Daemons.py. Rewrote Bootloader.py

  13 Jan 2005; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Networking.py - Complete rework of the screen using (as a
  template ) agaffney's network mounts screen. This screen still
  needs to be "integrated" into the backend, but will be completed
  within the next few days. At some point the dropdown needs to be
  changed to an entry combobox.

  09 Jan 2005; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Timezone.py - Updated so it now is integrated with the backend.
  When you select and item in the tree that is not a node,
  ( you need to press enter or double-click ) it will set your timezone.

  05 Jan 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Change all the math in Partitioning.py to work with sectors instead of
  cylinders.

  04 Jan 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  A few tweaks to make it "work" with the GLIStorageDevice changes.

  21 Dec 2004; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Daemons.py, Bootloader.py, Kernel.py, Stage.py, PortageTree.py, 
  MakeDotConf.py, RcDotConf.py now selects/loads the appropriate 
  options if a profile is loaded.  They are selected when each screen 
  is activated.
  In Timezone.py,Users.py
  Removed deprecation warning caused by gtk.OptionMenu() in Widgets.py.
  Removed some old debug values that were unnecessary.
  Integrated the Stage tarball URI, it nows loads from a profile and checks
  to make sure its a valid value by changing the background to pink.
  Created a test profile, "test_installprofile.xml" that selects different
  options illustrating the changes.
  Stage.py: Now doesn't change screens if the URI is invalid.
  Timezone.py: Changed the entire layout.  Made a recursive function to
  populate the treeview with the timezones from /usr/share/zoneinfo.
  
  20 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Partition screen "complete" with idiot-proofed goodness! Minor modification
  for info display when creating logical partition. Slider color changes to
  match selected filesystem when creating new partition.

  19 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Exit button works. Load button works. Save button works. Minor fixes to
  NetworkMounts due to switch to ComboBox for Type field. Old resize slider
  is now "new partition" slider. Partition screen adds/removes partitions.

  18 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Added Load/Save buttons and images (don't do anything yet). Reordered
  fields in NetworkMounts and added button next to Export ComboBox.

  12 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Completed rough working NetworkMounts screen: adds/removes/updates entries
  and saves to/reads from install profile. Moved some duplicated code into
  [enable|disable]_all_fields() functions. "fixed" the problem with the GTK
  assertion when calling set_text_column(0).

  12 Dec 2004; John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu>
  Networking.py updated to check ips while you type, as well as disabling
  the dropdown if any of the ip's are faulty.  This version turns the
  background of the gtk.Entry to "pink" until a valid ip address is found.
  Timezone.py updated to include the function generate_timezones which had
  previously been put in GLIUtility. Networking.py code has been
  overhauled/cleaned up to reflect the growing complexity of the panel.

  11 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Initial ChangeLog commit. Added set_size_request() call in gtkfe.py so the
  width of the left frame doesn't shift. Incorporated screen updates from
  John Laliberte <allanonl@bu.edu> (AllanonJL in #gentoo-installer). Added
  functionality to NetworkMounts.py to list NFS exports on a particular host.
