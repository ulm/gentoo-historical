I've started adding in the code to interface with the backend. To use this
code, you'll need to download an installer snapshot (from the same place you
got this tarball) and extract it. When running this program, you need to:

export PYTHONPATH="<where you extracted the installer tarball>:$PYTHONPATH"

You only need to do this once when you open up a new shell, xterm, etc. You
can then run this program normally.
