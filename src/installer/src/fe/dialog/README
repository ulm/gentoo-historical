When running this program, you need to do the following:

You'll need pythondialog (if running on liveCD, it'll already be there)
the file is in /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/dialog.py
put it in /src

You must do a ClientConfiguration for the install to work.
Keep in mind that the installer IS NOT FINISHED YET
AND !!PARTITIONING CAN RUIN YOUR BOX!!
