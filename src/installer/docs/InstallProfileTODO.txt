This file is to document what information is needed in GLIInstallProfile but isn't yet there...

############################

Method names:
set_make_conf()
get_make_conf()

This is a dictionary of key/value pairs.
For instance, in make.conf you would see a line like this:
USE="X gtk gtk2 alsa"

That line is broken up into the following {"USE" : "X gtk gtk2 alsa"}.
Therefore, get_make_conf() would return something like this:
{ "USE" : "X gtk gtk2 alsa", "GENTOO_MIRRORS" : "http://gentoo.mirrors.pair.com" }

############################

Method names:
set_rc_conf()
get_rc_conf()

Same as make.conf style

############################

Method name changes (and new methods):
Right now we have a set_network_interfaces() and get_network_interfaces()
However, we need to double this into set/get_network_interfaces_pre() and set/get_network_interfaces_post()
_pre defines network interfaces for the liveCD environment
_post defines network interfaces for the post-install environment
This will allow for a user to install while on one network while having the machine run on another network easily...

############################

Format change:
_partition tables has nfs type devices in the following format as a dictionary record: { <device (nfs)> : <mount point> }
However, often times options need to be added to the mount command.
Therefore the record should be like this:  { <device (nfs)> : ( <mount point>, <options> ) }
options is a string of options separated by commas.
It is in the same format used by the mount command.
ie. mount -t nfs -o rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 192.168.1.2:/usr/portage /mnt/gentoo/usr/portage
in this case the record would be: { "192.168.1.2:/usr/portage" : ( "/usr/portage", "rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192" ) }
Unfortunately, the _is_ip() or _is_hostname() test is going to fail (this is a bug)
because the true device name is "192.168.1.2:/usr/portage" rather than "192.168.1.2"
Because of this, we should probably make a test called _is_nfs()

############################

New Method:
set_ignore_install_step_depends()
get_ignore_install_step_depends()

This is a bool.

############################

Method Change:

get_portage_tree_sync() -> get_portage_tree_sync_type() 
set_portage_tree_sync() -> set_portage_tree_sync_type()

Rather than being a bool, it needs to be a string.
There will be 3 different types: "sync", "webrsync", and "custom"
