*GLI-0.01 (9 Feb 2004)

  04 Dec 2005; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  GLIStorageDevice now tracks partition boundaries in sectors instead of cylinders.
  Also now ignores <=100 sectors for free space. Removed remaining depends stuff
  from GLIInstallProfile.

  20 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  GLIStorageDevice returns "unknown" instead of "" for get_type()

  19 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Added get_extended_partition() to GLIStorageDevice. Rewrote get_logicals() to
  actually work. Commented out resizability checking code for speed.

  17 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Switched to using dumpe2fs to determine free space left in ext2/3 filesystem in
  GLIStorageDevice at the suggestion of plors

  10 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Added a function to GLIUtility to pull a value from a make.conf-style config
  file. Minor type fix to GLIInstallProfile.py

  09 Dec 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Added code in GLIArchitectureTemplate.py to write netmounts into fstab. Separated
  network mounts from partition data structure in GLIInstallProfile

  27 Nov 2004; Andrew Gaffney <agaffney@gentoo.org>
  Changed the way GLIStorageDevice.py determines the amount a ext2/3 filesystem
  can be resized.

  27 Oct 2004; Preston Cody <codeman@gentoo.org>
  Added some of the final functions to GLIInstallTemplate.
  Yes this project is still active despite rare use of the Changelog!

  11 Jun 2004; Nathaniel McCallum <npmccallum@gentoo.org>
  Added the GLIPartitionTools.py file.  This is a temporary insertion of 
  partitioning tools that will eventually go into their own package.

  27 Mar 2004; Nathaniel McCallum <npmccallum@gentoo.org>
  Added InstallProfileTODO.txt.  Added GLIClientConfiguration.py (contains run-time
  for the program).  Added __init__(install_profile, client_configuration) to 
  GLI.InstallProfile.  This sets install_profile and client_configuration once so as
  to avoid constantly passing stuff every time we call a method.

  26 Mar 2004; Nathaniel McCallum <npmccallum@gentoo.org>

  Added another private method to GLI.InstallTemplate.  _edit_config() modifies config
  files without messing up all the other stuff in them.  This will be used for making
  changes to make.conf, rc.conf, /etc/conf.d/net, etc...

  25 Mar 2004; Nathaniel McCallum <npmccallum@gentoo.org>

  Added GLI.InstallTemplate framework.  This is not yet functional.  However, it does
  have a few basic things.  I added two private methods.  One is _depends().  This
  will be used for dependency checking (ie. unpacking a tarball requires that
  partitioning has been done).  The other is _exec_in_chroot().  This is the exact
  same syntax as os.system(), however, instead of being run in the liveCD
  environment, it runs in the chroot.  This requires a bit of fork() magic, so I 
  isolated the code.  Hope to work more this week to get this class formed...

  14 Feb 2004; Eric Sammer <esammer@gentoo.org>

  Added SAX parsing. Made GLI.InstallProfile a subclass of xml.sax.ContentHandler for
  obvious reasons. Switched kernel_modules and users to be lists instead of tuples
  to allow for easier modification (mutable, rather than immutable objects). Updated
  existing pydoc and added more. Implemented body of GLI.InstallProfile.parse().
  Cleaned file format of GLI.py a bit. Fixed all accessors to use self references.
  Added initial unit test code.

  9 Feb 2004; Eric Sammer <esammer@gentoo.org>

  Added initial changelog. Setting up the basic structure of the CVS repository
  for the project. Added the UML class diagram in docs. Added a skeletal GLI
  python module. Added misc files such news, authors, etc.
