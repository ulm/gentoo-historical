		i gotta check for dhcp in the network stuff and emerge it if necessary?
		<agaffney> codeman: ok, so addNotification("warning", ...) for something
		  that failed but isn't a big deal, 'raise GLIException("blah", 
		  "kindabad", ...)' for something that *might* be fixable with a profile
		  edit, and 'raise GLIException("blah", "fatal", ...)' for the "oh my 
		  god, I crapped my pants" errors
		
	DialogFE:
		Add networking setup for CC <whisper>samyron</whisper>
		Add functionality to handle 'warning' and 'notice' level exceptions
		  see above^^
		custom kernel and kernel bootsplash options. (codeman)
