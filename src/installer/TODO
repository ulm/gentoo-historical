Gentoo Linux Installer TODO
Copyright 2005 Gentoo Technologies, Inc.

If you are working or plan to work on a task here put your name by it.

Things still needing to be done for the BETA release:
	Backend:
		GLIArchitectureTemplate.build_kernel():
			- test with 2.4 kernels
			- Check custom config for correct initrd support when using genkernel
			- hotplug/coldplug are NOT always needed with genkernel.
			- might need to pass --udev/--evms2/--lvm2/--dmraid to genkernel.
			- Source might not be in /usr/src/linux
		In Progress:
		secondary progress bar and X of Y for emerge notifications
		partitioning error checking.
		add distcc support
		add r_pppoe configuration stuff.
		network mounts into the fstab
	DialogFE (obsolete):
		support for /etc/portage/*
	gli-dialog: 
		add /etc/portage/* support
		finish make.conf conversion for advanced menu
		
	gtkFE:
		listed in fe/gtk/TODO

Things to put into a later version:
	
Future feature requests:
	
	add auto-update script to crontab once every week.
	if you chose to emerge X, have it configured and set to start on bootup
	god help us if we have to get your printer set up too!
