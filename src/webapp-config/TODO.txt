Here's the list of things that need doing to the webapp-config project:

* handling directories that change type when upgrading

  At the moment, if we're doing an upgrde and a directory already exists,
  we skip any changes to the directory itself.  This is great, until a
  real directory turns into a virtual directory, for example.

  This really needs fixing.

  The way to fix it is to make a significant internal change to the order
  that webapp-config processes files and directories.

  At the moment, webapp-config works by processing all the directories
  first, and then processing all the files that should live inside those
  directories.

  Instead, webapp-config needs to process a directory and its contents
  as a single unit.  The script will need to recurse down into each
  directory, and process sub-directories and its contents in the same way.
