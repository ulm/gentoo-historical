  18 Nov 2005; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@gentoo.org> +COPYING, +Cards,
  +LICENSE, +MonitorsDB, +blacklist, +check-cards, +pcitable:
  This is the first version of this data. The pcitable and MonitorsDB files
  came from http://cvs.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/soft/ldetect-lst/lst/
  while blacklist and check-cards come from Red Hat's hwdata package. The
  Cards file was created by me from the entries in the pcitable.
