We can not store kernel patches not created by gentoo developers in a
gentoo.org owned cvs server due to the copyright assignment issues.
Because of this, I've moved this directory's contents to a public
BitKeeper repository at genpatches.bkbits.net.  It is publicly
accessible and can be cloned by running:
	bk clone bk://genpatches.bkbits.net/genpatches

If any developer wants write access to this repository, please just
send me (gregkh@gentoo.org) a ssh public key.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, if anyone has any other
ideas on how to handle this, please let me and gentoo-core know about
it.
