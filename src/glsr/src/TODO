Ian:
* Consolidate the indexes into just the one (duplicate code = bad). (DONE)

* Convert the admin site modules over to the new style.

* Convert indexes into classes, perhaps. (DONE) 

Anyone:
* View Changelog

* Create new versions of scripts

* Rank scripts

* Member List

* Profile

* Fix the search feature

* Implement the news page

* Code the main page

* Fix the login for the admin section

* Thousands of other things that I can't think of right now.
