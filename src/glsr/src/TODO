Ian:
* Rework the User module.

* Consolidate the indexes into just the one (duplicate code = bad). (DONE)

* Convert the admin site modules over to the new style.

* Convert indexes into classes, perhaps. (DONE) 

* Salt the MD5s (INVALIDATED)

* Sort out the SQL code (DONE)

* Lots of other things I always forget when it comes to writing TODOs. 

* Validate input in UpdateIP(). 


Scott:

* Merge main page and news page.

* Implement user profiles.

* Script search should grab languages/Categories lists from mysql.

* Script listing / user listing need to use memberlist style listings.

* Template module improvements:
  - Make _counter, _is_odd, _is_even keywords instead of adding them to each
    loop.
  - Add a len keyword that will allow templates to do things like:
    {IF len(THE_LOOP) > 0}
  

Anyone:
* View Changelog

* Create new versions of scripts

* Rank scripts

* Profile

* Fix the search feature

* Implement the news page

* Code the main page

* Fix the login for the admin section

* Thousands of other things that I can't think of right now.
