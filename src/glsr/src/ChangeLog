   module name.)

 * Moved the session checking code from Page_Login._check_session into
   the index files.

   saves us performing duplicate queries. admin modules and index not yet
   converted.
 * Minor changes.

03 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * Moved login form out of the Header and into it's own page. Header executing

	difficult to work with.

	add comments to scripts.

22 Aug 2004; Scott Hadfield <hadfield@gentoo.org>:
 * Modified the Template module to comply with a naming standard. Functions
names as [a-z_][a-z1-9_]*. Fixed all of the code depending on those functions.
 * Removed the Print() function and replaced it with an output() function
which simply passes back the text that needs to be printed.
 * Fixed a couple bugs that had been haunting the template module :-).
 * Fixed some inconsitent use of tabs in: admin/Page_News.py, Stat.py
