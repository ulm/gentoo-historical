15 Dec 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * Tiny fix in index.py
 * Added missing entry for state table in pym/Config.py

13 Dec 2004; Scott Hadfield <hadfield@gentoo.org>:
 * Total rewrite of the template module. This should hopefully make debugging
   leaps and bounds easier. It should also speed up processing time and make
   the class much more flexible. Note that this rewrite should be fully
   compatible with the old templates.
 * Added the ability to add comments to templates. Put comments within {* *}.
 * Bug and formatting fixes on the page dispatcher (index.py)
 * Small bug fix in User.py (calling self in the global area of the class)
 * Added uid to the header output (index.py)
 * Added a 'RecentSub' function to Script.py to return the most recent
   subscript.
  
18 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:

14 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * offset for the error report list
 * Print to the top of the error report log

 * Minor fixes

06 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * Fixed dynamic module loading in the index file (NOTE: This method
   assigns the class object to the module name, not the module object to
   module name.)
 * admin/Page_Main.py converted to the new style
 * Updated URLs in the admin header

05 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * We now have only one index to handle both user and admin modules,
   also introduced the concept of domains to distingusih between the two.
   URL for the admin section should now read: index.py?domain=admin&page=foo

04 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * Converted the main index into a class
 * Tiny fixes
 * 

04 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * Moved the session checking code from Page_Login._check_session into
   the index files. 
 * site modules now accept any number of arguments from the index. This
   saves us performing duplicate queries. admin modules and index not yet
   converted.
 * Minor changes.

03 Nov 2004; Ian Leitch <port001@gentoo.org>:
 * Moved login form out of the Header and into it's own page. Header executing
   code = bad. Still needs work.    
 * Bug fixes.

28 Oct 2004; Scott Hadfield <hadfield@gentoo.org>:
 * Added a status (draft, pending, published) field to the subscript table.
 * A little more exception handling code.

29 Sep 2004; Scott Hadfield <hadfield@gentoo.org>:
 * Removed the error reporting code from the non-admin interface to make it
	easier to work with for now.
 * Changed the index.py quite a bit. Hopefully for the better :-).
 * Redesigned the non-admin interface because it was getting extremely
	difficult to work with.
 * Implemented basic commenting
 * You can now view scripts, view your scripts, create a new script,
	add comments to scripts.
 * Added TODO file.
 * Removed the login and session setup code from index.py and moved it into
	Page_Login.py.
 * Created a SubScript class within the Script.py module.
 * Made a few additions to the glsr.css.
 * Renamed some columns in the comments table.

	
22 Aug 2004; Scott Hadfield <hadfield@gentoo.org>:
 * Modified the Template module to comply with a naming standard. Functions
names as [a-z_][a-z1-9_]*. Fixed all of the code depending on those functions.
 * Removed the Print() function and replaced it with an output() function
which simply passes back the text that needs to be printed.
 * Fixed a couple bugs that had been haunting the template module :-).
 * Fixed some inconsitent use of tabs in: admin/Page_News.py, Stat.py
