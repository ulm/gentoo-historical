 * Modified the Template module to comply with a naming standard. Functions
names as [a-z_][a-z1-9_]*. Fixed all of the code depending on those functions.
 * Removed the Print() function and replaced it with an output() function
which simply passes back the text that needs to be printed.
 * Fixed a couple bugs that had been haunting the template module :-).
 * Fixed some inconsitent use of tabs in: admin/Page_News.py, Stat.py
