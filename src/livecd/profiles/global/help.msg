Gentoo Linux 1.4 LiveCD boot options - [F1 to redisplay boot graphic]                                                                                           The Gentoo Linux LiveCD allows for a number of boot options to be specified at  the initial isolinux prompt. To specify custom boot options, type "gentoo"      followed by a space, and then specify the boot options you want (separate each  boot option with a space.) If no boot options are needed, just hit enter at the prompt to boot. The following boot options (as well as others) are recognized:                                                                                  cdcache   Cache the entire runtime portion of the CD in RAM. This uses 40MB of            RAM but allows you to umount /mnt/cdrom, eject CD, and mount another. noapic    This option disables support for advanced programmable interrupt                controllers, which cause booting problems for some systems --                   particularly laptops.                                                 noscsi    This option disables boot-time storage device auto-detection; use               this option if the LiveCD locks up during the storage detection                 phase. (If this happens to you, file a bug at http://bugs.gentoo.org/           as well.)                                                             nonet     Disable boot-time network device auto-detection.                      acpi=on   Different from APIC, ACPI stands for "advanced configuration and                power interface." ACPI is required for some legacy-free systems, but            can potentially cause problems on others. If you're having boot                 trouble on a newer system, try using this option.                     ide=nodma Forcefully disable DMA for malfunctioning IDE devices.
