Welcome to the Gentoo Linux LiveCD!

The root password on this system has been auto-scrambled for security.

dhcpcd is automatically started if eth0 is detected, please kill if not 
needed, or boot with "gentoo nodhcp" 

Type "net-setup eth0" to specify eth0 IP address settings by hand.

/proc/config for kernel configuration.

To start an ssh server on this system, type "/etc/init.d/sshd start".
If you need to log in remotely as root, type "passwd root" to reset
root's password to a known value.

Stage tarball(s) and packages can be found in /mnt/cdrom/gentoo.  View
installation instructions by typing "less /install.txt" or "lynx
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml".

Please report any bugs you find to http://bugs.gentoo.org. Be sure to
include detailed information about how to reproduce the bug you are
reporting. Thanks for using Gentoo Linux!
