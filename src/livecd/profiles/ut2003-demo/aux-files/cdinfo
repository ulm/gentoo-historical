Welcome to the Gentoo Linux 1.4.1 "live" install/UT2003-demo CD :)

Here's a list of commands you can use to help get your system
configured to play Unreal Tournament 2003, or do other things:

Type "net-setup eth0" (for example) to configure the eth0
interface. Note that support for all network cards has been built
directly into the kernel.

Type "pci-setup" to detect and auto-enable drivers for common PCI 
cards.  ("pci-setup" will only load sound modules for SoundBlaster
Live!, Audigy and a few other cards; you may need to "modprobe" 
your sound card module manually.) The "aumix" audio mixer is 
available for adjusting volume.

Type "x-setup" to launch an accelerated NVIDIA X session. After
configuration completes, X (with openbox as the window manager)
will start. To launch the Unreal Tournament 2003 demo, right-click
on the background to pop up the openbox menu and select the first
option.

And you can view the license for the Unreal Tournament 2003 Demo
by typing "less /ut2k3-demo-LICENSE".

Other commands on this CD include: irrsi (irc client), ssh, scp, 
lynx (text Web browser) and a host of system utilities. The "nano"
and "vi" (nvi) editors are available.

Oh -- and if you want to install Gentoo Linux 1.4_rc1, you can
view the install docs by typing "less /install.txt", or by typing
"lynx http://www.gentoo.org/doc/build.html" if you have networking
configured.

Enjoy!
