The root password on this system has been auto-scrambled for security.

If any ethernet adapters were detected at boot, they should be auto-configured
if DHCP is available on your network.  Type "net-setup eth0" to specify eth0 IP
address settings by hand.

Check /etc/kernels/kernel-config-* for kernel configuration(s).
