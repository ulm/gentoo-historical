Overview of catalyst operation
==============================

* The program starts, and the local machine type is detected. 

* Based on this information, catalyst determines what kind of machine types
  it can build for (amd64 and ia64 can build for x86 as well, for example.)
  The appropriate arch plugins are loaded, which contain builder classes
  for each supported sub-arch.

* Command-line arguments are parsed. If specified, a spec file is read.

* These build variables are stored in an internal "spec" object, which will
  be a standard python dictionary. This spec dictionary contains all relevant
  build-related information.

* The spec object is passed to the appropriate subarch builder constructor.
  The subarch builder constructor updates the spec object with variables
  relevant to the sub-arch (pentium4, g3, etc.)

* The spec object is passed to the appropriate target constructor.
  The target constructor updates the spec object to contain data relevant
  to the particular target (stage1, stage3, grp, etc.)

*** PROTOTYPE CODE UP TO HERE IS COMPLETE (drobbins, 26 Oct '03)

* The full data of the spec object is written to disc, so there is a complete
  record of all variables that will be used to build what we're building.  This
  will allow for another person to re-use this information to replicate our
  work (it should be possible to distribute a spec file along with a portage
  snapshot and a starter tarball, and our build can be replicated exactly on
  any machine.) The spec object contains data like CFLAGS, CHOST, subarch,
  mainarch, the profile used to build, and for GRP and LiveCDs the complete
  package build list. This is important to allow work to be replicated. It's
  possible that the stage1/2/3.sh and other scripts should be distributed as
  well, to allow proper replication of work.

* The build process begins by calling the appropriate method of the builder
  instance. This includes cleanup, setup of chroot, entering the chroot,
  running the appropriate bash build script, checking for error conditions,
  and finishing up.
  
* The catalyst process is now complete :)
