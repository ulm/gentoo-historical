  08 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: support functions for spec
  file parsing and reading added. Will get added to the code soon.
  
  05 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Many bug fixes later, things
  seem to be working well for stage1/2/3 so I've added a README.
  
  28 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Significant rework of code
  structure. Everything is falling nicely into place.
  
  28 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Exception handling fully-
  integrated into current prototype code.
  
  27 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: beginning of exception
  handling integration, got some of the target code nicely fleshed out.
  
  24 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: major code rework in 
  progress on the python parts.
  
  17 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> files/grp/x86/x86.conf,
  files/grp/x86/x86.pkg.cd1, files/grp/x86/x86.pkg.cd2, files/grp/x86/x86.src,
  files/livecd/x86-basic/base.pkg, files/livecd/x86-basic/kern.pkg:
  for organiation's sake, I have moved the files, such as livecd foundations,
  into catalyst/files. It will make it easier for us when ebuild time comes
  around.

  15 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> targets/stage3/stage3.sh:
  All preliminary target build scripts are now added and coded to near as spec
  that we can have at this point.

  14 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobins@gentoo.org>: new and improved ChangeLog;
  snapshots now work ("./catalyst-util.py snap 20031014",) and snapshotting
  cleans up after itself (temp files deleted,) something that should be
  continued as much as reasonably possible in other parts of catalyst. Also, we
  have /etc/catalyst.conf config file reading stub code completed, and internal
  fall-backs to reasonable global config defaults completed.
