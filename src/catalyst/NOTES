If you were previously using a script to call Catalyst and pass options to it on
the commandline (catalyst target=foo meep=yar), BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED.
You now need to pass Catalyst the -C (--cli) option to tell it to read the next
arguments as a commandline. NOTE THAT -C MUST BE THE LAST ARGUMENT PASSED OR
ELSE BREAKAGE WILL ENSUE.

The old behavior exists in Catalyst <=1.0.8. The new behavior will exist in
Catalyst >=1.0.9.
