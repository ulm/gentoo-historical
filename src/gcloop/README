Userspace utilities for handling images for gcloop,  Kernel modules
 to add support for filesystem-independent, transparently decompressed, 
read-only block devices on 2.6 linux kernels.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
You need ucl in order to use gcloop. Get it from http://upx.sf.net

Currently is present just the ucl(nrv2e) flavour, the other compressor
will follow soon.

USAGE:
------

Creating a compressed image:

 create_compressed_ucl_fs infile blocksize > outfile

alternate way:

 compressloop_ucl [options] infile outfile

blocksize must be a multiple of 512  bytes. Make sure you have enough
swap to hold the entire compressed image in virtual memory! Use "-"
as filename to read data from stdin, as in:

 mkisofs -r datadir | create_compressed_fs - 131072 > datadir.iso.compressed

Mounting a compressed image (see above for device creation):
 modprobe compressloop (will change soon)
 losetup -E 19 -e ucl-0 /dev/loop0 image.ucl
 mount -o ro -t whatever /dev/loop0 /mnt/compressed

NOTICE: You MUST update losetup in order to get it working correctly!

For more information, please refer to the sources. If you don't understand
what all this is about, please DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OR USE THIS
SOFTWARE.
