VERY EXPERIMENTAL
seems to work so far on amd64 and x86

DEPENDANCIES:
- bootsplash
- gcc/binutils
- bash

INSTALLATION:

put genkernel.conf in /etc

put genkernel.sh in /usr/bin

put the rest of the files and directories in /usr/share/genkernel



PORTING:

To port to other arches:

cd /usr/share/genkernel
cp -Rp x86 ${myarch}
mkdir /usr/share/genkernel/pkg/${myarch}


modify what is needed in the /usr/share/genkernel/${myarch}
directory, this is all the arch-specific stuff, as well
as a generic kernel-config
