- add LVM2 support, so people that have their root partitions
  LVM2-ized can boot.
- bump busybox version to _pre5 which has initial 2.6 insmod
  and devfsd support.  Provide configurable options to allow
  building real devfsd or using busybox devfsd, and likewise
  for insmod.
- need configs for other arches
