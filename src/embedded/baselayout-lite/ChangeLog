  Initial commit
  sbin/{rc,runscript,functions.sh} still need a lot of work
  etc/inittab still needs a lot of work too
  need to add default init scripts for the stuff that comes with regular
	baselayout
  I'll hopefully get to the other stuff soon, I mostly just want to
	commit so people can see what I'm up to
  This isn't useful yet, don't even try it
