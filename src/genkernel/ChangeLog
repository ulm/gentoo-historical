  21 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel:
  fixed the $GK_SHARE path so it points to /usr/share/$P.

  20 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> src/linuxrc:
  added 2.6 compatibility to linuxrc, as well as cleaning up the code a bit -
  removing the multiple for's doing cmd line parsing, replacing them with a case stmt.

  20 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> files/default-config-2.6:
  removed Silicon Chipsets SATA support because it times out *forever* if there
  are no devices attached, also added framebuffer support, which was forgotten

  19 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel:
  just working on stuff, commiting before bed - I have hacked in 2.6 support,
  but have not tested yet
