  22 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel, files/default-config-2.4:
  added support for CONFIG_FILTER and CONFIG_PACKET, which should fix bug #30130

  21 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel, files/settings, src/linuxrc:
  fixed files/settings to reflect where the bootsplash initrd file is, as well
  as cleaning up the way we detect which kernel is currently running

  21 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel, files/default-config-2.6:
  statically included initrd into the kernel to try to get initrd to work

  21 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel:
  fixed the $GK_SHARE path so it points to /usr/share/$P.

  20 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> src/linuxrc:
  added 2.6 compatibility to linuxrc, as well as cleaning up the code a bit -
  removing the multiple for's doing cmd line parsing, replacing them with a case stmt.

  20 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> files/default-config-2.6:
  removed Silicon Chipsets SATA support because it times out *forever* if there
  are no devices attached, also added framebuffer support, which was forgotten

  19 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> genkernel:
  just working on stuff, commiting before bed - I have hacked in 2.6 support,
  but have not tested yet

  18 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> 1024.initrd, README, bin-keymaps.tar.gz,
  busybox-0.60.5.tar.bz2, cloop_0.68-2.tar.gz, default-config, kernel-config,
  key.lst, linuxrc, livecdrc, settings, files/default-config,
  files/kernel-config, files/key.lst, files/livecdrc, files/settings,
  src/1024.initrd, src/linuxrc:
  massive organization.
