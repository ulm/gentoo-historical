27 Feb 2003; alain@gentoo.org:

  - Added cvsdoc group for translators.  Changed /space/cvsroot/gentoo/xml/htdocs/doc
    to have that group.

21 Feb 2003; alain@gentoo.org:

  - Added cvsweb, cvsadmin, and cvsgwn to the groups.  Needed for access
    right management after the CVS reorg.

  - Removed "gentoo -a gentoo-x86" from CVSROOT to support the new gentoo
    root directory.

  - Created /home/cvsroot/gentoo and a bunch of subdirectories for new
    check-ins (including this file).
