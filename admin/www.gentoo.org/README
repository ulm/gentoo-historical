Hi There!

Here are some simple instructions on how to configure and update this site, written by 
Daniel Robbins on 09 Nov 2002.

Here is how you would typically go about setting up a gentoo.org Web site from scratch:

1) install apache and AxKit
2) do this:
$ cd /home/httpd
$ CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d me@cvs.gentoo.org:/home/cvsroot/gentoo-src/gentoo-xml
$ export WEBROOT=/home/httpd/gentoo-src/gentoo-xml/htdocs
$ cd /home/httpd/gentoo-src/gentoo-xml/scripts
$ (run all scripts in this directory to generate dynamic content and sync images to ibiblio)
3) edit apache.conf so that /home/httpd/gentoo-src/gentoo-xml/htdocs is the DocumentRoot
4) The site is up and running
5) cron some of the sripts in the scripts directory to keep the site continually up-to-date

Here is how to update the site:

$ cd /home/httpd/gentoo-src/gentoo-xml
$ cvs -q update -dP
$ cd ../scripts
$ (run scripts as necessary to regenerate portions of the site/sync images to ibiblio)

Best Regards,

Daniel Robbins
